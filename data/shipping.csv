Negotiations on the first-ever global climate agreement for an entire industry have just been kicked into the long grass in London. Danish Shipping calls it “a major disappointment.”

“This is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it’s a big disappointment.”

That is the clear conclusion from Danish Shipping’s CEO, Anne H. Steffensen, following dramatic developments at the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO).

This week, member states gathered in London to finally adopt the Net Zero Framework agreement, which was initially reached back in April. The agreement aims to bring international shipping emissions down to net zero by 2050. Until very recently, that deal appeared secure. But after two days of stalled talks in the negotiation room, the IMO has chosen to postpone the vote on the agreement.

“Much has happened in the world since 2023, when the framework for the strategy was adopted. Unfortunately, that means there have been all sorts of other agendas in the negotiation room besides climate. Geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in – also at the IMO,” said Anne H. Steffensen.

The agreement would have had a positive effect on the price gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels, which are essential for the transition of shipping. Today, alternative fuels are three to four times more expensive than fossil fuels, and production remains at a very low level, particularly in Europe.

“Shipping still urgently needs global regulation and a clear plan for the green transition. That’s necessary to support investments in new green ships and the green fuels we need to sail on. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough political will in the room to finish the job this week. But where there’s life, there’s hope. The work for shipping’s green transition continues,” said Anne H. Steffensen.

IMO’s Net Zero Framework:

The agreement includes, among other things, a requirement for the gradual reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels ships use. Ships that emit more than allowed will have to pay, while the most energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units, as well as receive rewards for using green fuels. Emitting greenhouse gases will become more expensive – and reducing them will pay off.

The Dutch company has also sold its older, fuel-intensive vessels, including several VLCCs and capsize ships, in a bid to reinvest in newer, more efficient builds that can use cleaner technologies.

The move to acquire the Namibian hydrogen project and reinvest in its marine fleets, comes shortly after a delay in the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) vote on stricter emissions regulations.

Three Years On, Does the UFLPA Still Make Sense?

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, which is scheduled to meet this week, will stay the course and work on the guidelines for implementing the NZF. Maritime shipping accounts for roughly 3 percent of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions.

The move came a day after President Donald Trump expressed his “outrage” over the deal on his Truth Social platform, saying that the United States “would NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.”

Writing in a joint statement last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the United States was mulling possible action against countries that backed the measure, including initiating antitrust probes and sanctions, imposing additional port fees and other penalties on their ships, and perhaps even blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

They said that the agreement would unduly or unfairly burden the United States, harm the interests of the American people and raise global shipping costs by as much as 10 percent. While the United States walked out of April’s deliberations over a draft agreement, Russia and Saudi Arabia joined in its dissent at the time by voting against the measure. All three pressed for the framework’s delayed adoption.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the officials wrote. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

In a terse response two days later, the European Commission said that it was in favor of efforts to decarbonize the shipping sector and level the global playing field.

UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres saw Friday’s decision as a “missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path toward net-zero emissions.”

It was only in September that Trump, a longtime fossil fuel proponent who made “drill, baby, drill” a frequent campaign slogan, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that climate change was the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

“All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said. “They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Earlier this month, the White House nixed $7.6 billion in grants that underpinned hundreds of clean energy projects in more than a dozen states—all of which voted for the Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in last year’s presidential election.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” Wright had said. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment.”

The NZF would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 gross tonnage or more to pay a fee if their carbon emissions exceed a certain mandatory limit, thereby incentivizing cleaner fuels and technologies. Collected revenue would be used to reward low-emissions ships, mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable member states and support innovation and research in developing countries. If the measure had gone through, it would have marked the first time a legally binding global carbon price was levied on any sector.

A missed opportunity aside, the delay is also a “setback” that will derail innovation, deepen inequities and render more difficult and expensive the transition to clean shipping, said Natacha Stamatiou, global shipping and IMO delegation lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.

“We know progress is possible when governments act together; now they have the opportunity to prove it,” she said in a statement. “We cannot afford to wait any longer. It is vital that member states return to the negotiating table and deliver a measure that reflects wise ambition—one that delivers a just and effective energy transition to secure a cleaner, more equitable future for generations to come.”

In his closing remarks on Friday, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged member states to work together and arrive at an accord over the next year.

“Even though you have differences of opinion, you all spoke in support of the work of this organization,” he said. “There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/sourcing_journal_735/64333df08211b058e4bc777beb3cbcec,N,,2025-10-21 12:20:47.654389

With majority of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s member states voting to delay the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for global shipping by one year, how would the stakes tilt for shipping? It is understandable that there is a clarion call onto IMO to have a ‘Universal’ approach. One that encompasses the trade flows, volumes across trade lanes, inclusivity for the various ship types, impact on flag vessels from various origins, Small and Medium Ship Owners and the inclusion of possible incentives.

The supposed timelines were for the effect to happen in late 2027 with reporting starting 2028, with phases planned until 2030 to reduce GHG emissions by 25-40% with adoption of cleaner fuels going up by 5-10%. Carbon emissions beyond limits were to be priced and plowed to the IMO Net Zero Fund with the aim to invest this into building smarter, cleaner technologies for fuel infrastructure, ports, and green shipping corridors. However, that has now shifted to the right. Containership operators have been placing aggressive targets for decarbonizing their own shipping operations to early 2040s, even before with the supposed 2050 Net Zero plans. That left the bell on the Breakbulk MPV sector’s neck, driven much more by the Bunkering prices, yet being a fraction of the tonnage as against containers, tankers, and bulkers in the market.

How would these changes affect the MPV market? For now, the double situation of ageing fleets and relatively lower newbuildings is here to stay. It goes without saying the effect of high capital investments & their returns, especially when regulations are vetted fluidly for now. And so, it is understandable for the sector to continue its “wait and watch” mode with pockets of activity seen and strides in the Shortsea sector happening too. However, will the compulsion to go greener, have lesser hunger needs to be seen.

With expected project pickups predicted for 2026, the sector is expecting recovery in the MPV prices post a leaner H2 2025. The Toepfer’s Multipurpose Index (TMI) had a marginal dip for Oct 2025, to USD 12,690, a 16-month low, though it must be noted that the prices have remained buoyant and range-bound despite an overall leaner-demand play globally.

The USA had been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan since April over concerns the move could raise prices for consumers, the BBC wrote.","More than 100 countries had gathered at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s headquarters in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world’s first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions, the 17 October report said.

However, US President Donald Trump had called the plan a “green scam” and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it, the BBC wrote.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quoted as saying the outcome a “huge win” for Trump.

IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez had issued a “plea” that there should be no repetition of the way the meeting had been approached.

On the day of the BBC report – when countries should have been voting to approve the deal – Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year, which was narrowly approved.

The chairman had said this would mean the agreement would not be approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have had to be revised, the BBC wrote.

Ralph Regenvanu, minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia’s motion was quoted as saying “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,” he said.

The deal had generally been supported by the shipping industry as it offered consistent global standards, the report said.

Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, was quoted as saying: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.”

While most European Union (EU) nations and the UK had voted to continue the talks, some countries including Greece had gone against the EU bloc and voted to abstain, the BBC wrote.

Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings.

Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly relied on the USA for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

First agreed in April after ten years of negotiations, the deal was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

The agreement would have meant that from 2028 ship owners would have had to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines, the report said.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea.

Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive, according to the report.

Without intervention, the IMO has previously estimated that by 2050 maritime emissions could increase by between 10% and 150%.

The USA had been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan since April over concerns the move could raise prices for consumers, the BBC wrote.

With talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 did not appear feasible, the report said.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Marine-Biofuels.jpeg?mtime=1744793203,N,,2025-10-21 11:16:56.153896

More than 100 other countries announced new climate commitments during a high-level summit a few days later.","In the Marshall Islands, where the land averages only 7 feet (2 meters) above sea level, people are acutely aware of climate change.

Their ancestors have lived on this string of Pacific islands for thousands of years. But as sea level rises, storms more easily flood communities and farmland with saltwater. Warming ocean water has triggered mass coral-bleaching events, harming habitats that are important for both tourism and fish that the islands’ economy relies on.

If the world fails to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, studies suggest low-lying islands like these could be uninhabitable within decades.

Climate change isn’t just a problem for islands. Countries worldwide are experiencing intensifying storms, dangerous heat waves and rising seas as global temperatures rise.

Yet, after 30 years of international climate talks, 10 years of a global treaty promising to keep temperatures in check, and trillions of dollars in damage, the world is still not on track to stop rising global temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions were at record highs in 2024, and it was Earth’s hottest year on record.

I study the dynamics of global environmental politics, including the United Nations climate negotiations. And I and my lab have been tracking countries’ latest climate pledges – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – to see which countries have stepped up their efforts, which have slid back and who has ideas that can deliver a safer world for everyone.

While the Trump administration has been pressuring countries to back away from their climate commitments – and succeeded in delaying an International Maritime Organization vote on a global plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions from shipping after threatening other counties with sanctions, visa restrictions and port fees if they supported it – many countries are still pressing ahead.

Trump agitates, but many countries are steadfast

U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration came into office vowing to eliminate climate regulations and boost the fossil fuel industry, derided concerns about climate change in his Sept. 23, 2025, speech to the U.N. General Assembly. He called climate change the “greatest con job ever perpetuated” and ridiculed green energy and climate science.

Trump’s language no longer surprises world leaders, though. More than 100 other countries announced new climate commitments during a high-level summit a few days later.

China, currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, was lauded for hitting its green energy targets five years early. Its rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and electric vehicle manufacturing has reduced pollution in Chinese cities while also boosting its economy and expanding the government’s influence around the world.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country’s first absolute emissions reduction goal at the summit, committing to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035. China also committed to nearly triple its solar and wind power capacity and expand reforestation efforts.

While advocates and other governments had hoped for a stronger announcement from China, the new goals mark an important shift from the country’s earlier carbon intensity targets, which aimed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output but still allowed emissions to grow over time.

The European Union has yet to submit its new commitments, but the group of 27 European countries delivered a letter of intent, saying it would commit to a 66% to 72% collective decrease in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Europe has seen a swift rise in renewable energy, up sharply since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put the continent’s natural gas supplies in jeopardy.

The EU has also made waves by extending its carbon pricing rules beyond its borders.

The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, scheduled to begin in January 2026, will be the first system to charge for the climate impact of imported goods coming into Europe from countries that don’t have carbon prices similar to the EU’s. The measure, meant to even the playing field for EU industries, sets a global precedent for linking carbon emissions to trade.

However, the EU’s climate plans are also facing some headwinds. Its parliament is moving toward softening new corporate sustainability requirements after pressure from companies. And it may face calls from some member countries to delay a new carbon market meant to cut emissions from road transportation and buildings, Politico reported.

The EU has pledged to mobilize up to 300 billion Euros (about US$350 billion) to support the global clean energy transition in developing countries.

The United Kingdom, Japan and Australia submitted their most ambitious targets to date. All three put them on track to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning any greenhouse gases they emit will be offset by projects that avoid carbon emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.

In Australia, Queensland’s recent announcement that it would extend existing coal power plant use to the 2030s and 2040s may slow national progress. But Queensland also supports scaling up renewable energy and is still aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050.

Norway committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 70% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, which would align with the Paris Agreement goal to keep global emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). However, it plans to remain a major oil and gas exporter.

Notably, many developing countries also stepped up their commitments.

Brazil pledged a net emissions reduction of 59% to 67% by 2035 and is maintaining its 2050 net-zero target. The government also drew criticism for approving plans for oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River.

Free riding and taking cover behind the US

However, while some new climate commitments signal important momentum in the fight against climate change, the tug-of-war between global ambition to slow climate change and strategic self-interests was palpable at the New York summit. The responses to Trump’s remarks revealed both veiled critiques and deceleration of climate action by some governments.

China criticized backsliding by some countries, without naming names.

Brazil used the summit to call out countries that were late in submitting their updated climate commitments. Only about a third had submitted their updated pledges at that point.

While it is difficult to parse out individual country motivations – economic stress, wars and political influence can all play a role – many scholars worry that U.S. backsliding will lead other countries to reduce their climate commitments, and some recent pledges appear to back this up.

Many petroleum-producing countries missed the U.N. pledge deadline. Qatar, which recently gifted the U.S. a jet plane for Trump’s use and has an economy largely bolstered by the oil and gas industry, has not updated its pledge since 2021. The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council’s average emissions reduction target is even lower than Qatar’s, at around 21.6% by 2030.

Similarly, Argentina, among the world’s top holders of shale oil and gas reserves, has not released its updated commitments. Progress on its previous commitment has been undermined by political shifts since President Javier Milei’s election in 2023.

Milei initially vowed to abandon the 2030 agenda entirely and withdraw from the Paris Agreement, though his administration later backtracked. His dismissal of climate change as a “socialist lie” has aligned Argentina closely with Trump, culminating in a recently planned US$20 billion aid package from the U.S. to Argentina and raising questions about whether Argentina’s climate stance reflects genuine policy or geopolitical strategy.

Also noticeably absent are commitments from India, Mexico, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Angola weakened its climate pledge, citing lack of international funding.

A new way to make climate commitments?

While many countries are promising progress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the commitments formally submitted as of Oct. 20 were still far below the level needed to keep global temperatures from rising by 2 C (3.6 F), let alone 1.5 C.

To help boost national efforts and accountability, Brazil has proposed a new approach it calls a globally determined contribution. Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol framework, which set fixed, country-specific emission reduction targets based on historical baselines, or the 2015 Paris Agreement’s pledge-as-you-can system, it would establish global targets aligned with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals.

So, a globally determined contribution might state, for example, that the world will triple its renewable energy production and reverse deforestation by 2030. A target like that gives countries a clearer path of action. The new format would also allow city and state actions to be counted separately, increasing incentives for them to act.

As the host of the COP30 climate talks Nov. 10-21, 2025, Brazil is uniquely positioned to champion this concept. In the absence of U.S. leadership, the proposal could offer a rare opportunity for countries to collectively strengthen commitments and reshape treaty language in a way never seen before – leaving open the possibility for progress.

Threat of US sanctions stall adoption of IMO's global pricing system to curb greenhouse gases

Member states of the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) after threats by the Trump administration to impose sanctions on countries that vote in support of the proposed global carbon pricing mechanism. The NZF standards, which were set to be formally adopted in this week's meeting and enter into force in 2027, would have become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

The decision and debate around postponing the vote reflected deep divisions, with 57 countries voting in favor of a delay, 49 against a delay and 21 abstaining. IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez stated that the year delay will provide time to adopt amendments and build the needed consensus to support the NZF. Postponement was backed by oil-producing nations, China, and major flag states like Liberia and Panama, while most EU countries, Norway, and the UK opposed the move. The threat of US sanctions, risking increased tariffs, penalties and visa restrictions against supporting countries, was a tipping point, empowering the bloc led by Saudi Arabia and the US in opposition to the NZF. Some countries that previously supported or abstained in the preliminary April vote took new positions as the conference convened this week, throwing what had been expected to be a proforma session into disarray. A consensus emerged that a delay was preferable to a failure to approve implementation, as there would be no clear path forward on how to reintroduce or amend the NZF.

In the April meeting of the UN shipping body, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, and 24 countries abstained. Those countries that support the framework argue that a global fuel standard is needed in order to ensure a managed transition, ensuring availability of fuel, uptake and transfer of zero-emission fuels and technology, seafarer training and capacity building. Developing states in particular would face steep challenges on meeting new standards and would need the industry to share risks.

Saudi Arabia, which led the opposing bloc in April, argued that taxing shipping emissions would raise food and commodity costs, with developing countries hardest hit. Riyadh also argued that IMO's proposed powers to raise funds, spend money, and impose sanctions are beyond its legal authority under the MARPOL convention. In the October session, Washington and Riyadh called for the IMO to abandon its long-standing tacit acceptance process, in which new rules automatically take effect 10 months after adoption unless a critical mass of states object, in favor of explicit acceptance requiring two-thirds of governments to individually ratify the changes. Most delegations, led by Denmark, Canada, Australia, the EU and Kenya, rejected the proposal outright, warning that it would paralyze future IMO rule-making.

The outlook for future adoption of a revised NZF is mixed. The Trump administration, which considers the framework an unfair carbon tax on American businesses, is unlikely to agree to any proposal with a mandatory compliance clause or penalties. Furthermore, President Trump has demonstrated that he is willing to sanction international bodies, individuals and countries adopting policies adverse to his administration's priorities. Supporters of the NZF are hoping that the political risk environment will be altered over the next year, generating support for energy transition and global carbon reduction measures.

US Developments

Congress Renews Call for Russia Sanctions as Trump Plans Summit with Putin

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said last week that Members of Congress are ""talking about a time and date"" for a vote on the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 (S. 1241) and that, in his opinion, ""it's time to move"" on it. Multiple Senators including Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), the Senate Democratic Whip, voiced their support for passing the legislation, which already has strong bipartisan support across both Chambers.

Thune said that he expects the bill to be brought up in the next 30 days. Depending on when the legislation is brought forward, Congress may be voting on the Act at the same time as President Trump's planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary. After a call with Putin on October 16, Trump said negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will happen after a delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with their Russian counterparts this week.

If the bill passes before the meeting with Putin, Trump may use it as part of his efforts to end Russian energy purchases across Europe, India, and other countries as leverage in the negotiations. However, the White House has argued in the past that the Act would restrict Trump's flexibility in his negotiations with Russia. In particular, the administration has said that the Act would limit the ability of the President to offer Russia relief from sanctions in exchange for a favorable end to the war. Although Trump has also voiced support for imposing sanctions on Russia in the past, it is unclear whether he would sign the Act if it were to pass Congress during his administration's negotiations with Russia.

OFAC Targets Affiliates of Haitian Gang

On October 17, OFAC sanctioned two individuals for their support of or affiliation with Viv Ansanm, a coalition of gangs that was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) on May 2, 2025, for contributing to destabilizing activities in Haiti, including coordinated attacks on critical infrastructure. One of the designated individuals, Dimitri Herard, is a former Haitian police officer who OFAC alleges was connected to, and later imprisoned for, the assassination of former President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. OFAC alleges that the other designated individual, Kempes Sanon, is the leader of the Bel Air gang, a constituent gang in the Viv Ansanm alliance, that has been involved in indiscriminate civilian killings and extortion, among other crimes.

UK Developments

UK to Move to a Single Sanctions List from January 2026

The UK Government has announced that from January 28, 2026, the UK Sanctions List will become the single authoritative source for all UK sanctions designations. Currently, UK designations are detailed in two lists, the UK Sanctions List, published by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Consolidated List of Asset Freeze Targets, published for HM Treasury by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). The OFSI Consolidated List of Asset Freeze Targets will close at 09:00 GMT on January 28, 2026. This change, jointly announced by the FCDO, HM Treasury and OFSI, responds to industry feedback that a single list will simplify compliance and remove duplication when screening UK designated persons. Businesses that currently rely on both lists are advised to switch to the UK Sanctions List as their primary data source well in advance of the transition and review their internal systems accordingly. Updated UK Government guidance has been published to support compliance preparations.

OTSI Uses Case Study to Highlight Best Practice in Detecting Trade Sanctions Breaches

The Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (""OTSI"") has published a detailed case study to illustrate how robust due diligence can prevent breaches of UK trade sanctions. The case study concerns a UK branch of a multinational bank that identified several suspicious payments linked to the movement of Russian-origin goods to a third country. These goods were subject to prohibitions under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which make it an offence for a UK person to facilitate trade involving restricted goods from Russia.

In this case, payments for the prohibited goods were routed through the bank's UK branch, which acted as an intermediary in the transaction. The branch's internal account screening systems flagged the activity, triggering enhanced due diligence checks. Following its investigation, the bank correctly declined to process the payments and voluntarily reported the matter to OTSI using its online reporting tool. OTSI reviewed the information provided, including invoices and contractual documents, and confirmed that no breach had occurred, as the payments were stopped before completion.

OTSI's key takeaways for industry from this case study include understanding how UK trade prohibitions apply to financial services, performing enhanced due diligence on high-risk clients and jurisdictions, maintaining robust screening systems capable of halting suspect transactions, and using OTSI's reporting tool to disclose potential breaches. Businesses are encouraged to adopt a risk-based approach to sanctions compliance and to view trade sanctions awareness as an essential element of responsible corporate governance.

OFSI Publishes Annual Sanctions Review

OFSI has published its Annual Sanctions Review for 2024-2025, highlighting continued progress in enforcement and industry engagement. The report shows that assets frozen under UK sanctions rose from £24.4 billion to £37 billion, with £28.7 billion linked to Russia-related measures since 2022. OFSI recorded 394 suspected breach cases and issued 57 enforcement actions, including penalties against Integral Concierge Services Limited and Herbert Smith Freehills. The number of designations on the UK list reached 4,733, with 2,113 related to Russia. The review underscores OFSI's focus on strengthening compliance, modernising its licensing systems, and maintaining enforcement as a central feature of the UK's economic deterrence strategy.

UK Government Targets Russian Oil Majors and Defence Sector in Latest Round of Russia Sanctions

The UK Government has designated 34 entities, five individuals, and specified 51 ships under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, following the unilateral decision by the UK Government to further target Russian oil revenues and military supply chains. Notably, the UK government has imposed Russia's two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil. According to a UK Government press release, these sanctions target two of the world's biggest energy companies and their global enablers, including four oil terminals in China, 44 tankers in the ""shadow fleet"" transporting Russian oil, and Indian incorporated company, Nayara Energy Limited. The measures also impose sanctions on businesses that supply electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles used on the battlefield in Ukraine, including businesses operating in China, Singapore, Thailand, and Turkey. Businesses should update screening systems immediately to reflect the expanded list, paying particular attention to counterparties in the energy and electronics sectors, where overlap with newly listed entities is most likely.

While precise details remain to be announced, the UK government also has signalled its intention to ban imports of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude oil, which would represent a significant expansion of existing UK sanctions on Russian oil and oil products.

The UK Government has also issued two new general licences to allow the wind-down of existing transactions in response to the imposition of the latest wave of sanctions on Russia affecting the energy industry (the ""GLs""). The GLs cover the wind-down of existing operations with Russian oil majors (GL INT/2025/7539056), and with any of the newly sanctioned energy companies with ties to the Russian energy industry (GL INT/2025/7538856). These GLs took effect from October 15, 2025, and expire at 23.59 on November 28, 2025, and November 13, 2025, respectively. Additionally, on October 15, 2025, existing General Licences INT/2025/5886860 and INT/2025/5635700 were amended to include PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, PJSC Rosneft Oil Company, and their subsidiaries within their scope following their UK designations.

This latest action marks one of the most significant expansions of the UK's Russia sanctions to date, underscoring the UK Government's continued focus on disrupting Russia's oil revenues. Companies operating in the global energy supply chain should assess both direct and indirect links to newly sanctioned entities, ensure compliance procedures are up to date, and prepare for increased scrutiny of Russian oil-related transactions.

UK Government Targets Major Online Fraud Network in Latest Round of Global Human Rights Sanctions

The UK Government has acted in coordination with the United States to designate six individuals and six entities involved in the operation of illegal scam centres that defraud victims across the world out of substantial sums of money and torture their trafficked workers. The designations have been made under the Global Human Rights sanctions regime. According to a UK Government press release, the leader of the network, Chen Zhi, and his web of enablers have incorporated their businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in the London property market to defraud victims on an industrial scale, including in the UK. The designated persons are now subject to a UK asset freeze, and, in the case of individuals, a UK travel ban.

UK Extends Russia Sectoral Software General Trade Licence to April 2026

The Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) has extended the validity of the General Trade Licence (Russia Sanctions – Sectoral Software and Technology), which authorises certain transfers of business software and technology to Russia that would otherwise be prohibited under Chapter 4N of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. The new licence, which replaces the previous version due to expire on October 20, 2025, will now remain in effect until April 17, 2026, and contains identical provisions to the earlier iteration of the licence.

To qualify, transfers must be made to multinational clients headquartered outside Russia, relate to contracts agreed before April 23, 2025, and be for non-predominant use by Russian subsidiaries. Businesses using the licence must comply with registration and record-keeping requirements. The extension provides limited operational continuity for multinational firms with pre-existing contractual obligations involving Russian affiliates, while ensuring adherence to UK sanctions restrictions on technology and software transfers.

EU Developments

The European Commission recently published updated FAQs clarifying restrictive measures under Council Regulation 833/2014, focusing on the import ban on refined petroleum products derived from Russian crude oil and the export-related restrictions on dual-use goods and advanced technologies.

As part of the 18th sanctions package against Russia, the EU introduced a ban on the purchase, import, or transfer of refined petroleum products produced from Russian crude oil into the EU. As a result, starting January 21, 2026, importers must provide evidence at the time of importation demonstrating the origin of the crude oil used in the production of refined petroleum products. The updated FAQs outline acceptable forms of evidence for these purposes, as well as the need for operators to exercise enhanced due diligence for imports from countries with high Russian crude intake such as Türkiye, India, and China. The FAQs also list third countries considered net exporters of crude oil in 2024, which benefit from a presumption that their petroleum products are domestically sourced unless rebutted by credible indications of Russian crude use.

In parallel, the Commission updated its FAQs on export restrictions for dual-use and advanced technology items against Russia to support competent authorities and stakeholders in implementing the restrictions under Council Regulation 833/2014. The FAQs clarify the scope of prohibited sensitive items and the specific situations in which derogations may apply. They also provide guidance to help businesses understand how the export restrictions operate in practice, along with a section outlining cooperation with partner countries that have aligned their export control measures with the EU sanctions framework.

China Sanctions US Subsidiaries of South Korean Shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean

In response to the United States' implementation of final measures under its Section 301 investigation targeting China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced, on October 14, 2025, counter sanctions against five US subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean as approved by China's National Anti Foreign Sanctions Coordination Mechanism. MOFCOM stated that these subsidiaries, Hanwha Shipping LLC, Hanwha Philly Shipyard Inc., Hanwha Ocean USA International LLC, Hanwha Shipping Holdings LLC, and HS USA Holdings Corp., had assisted and supported the US government's investigation and related actions, thereby harming China's sovereignty and security.

All organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation, or other activities with these entities, pursuant to China's Anti Foreign Sanctions Law and its implementing provisions. On October 17, a spokesperson for the US State Department denounced China's sanctions, describing it as an ""irresponsible attempt"" to disrupt private business operations and undermine South Korea–US efforts to revitalize America's shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors.

Australian Authorities Charge Man Over Alleged Sanctions-Breaching Remittances

On October 15, 2025, the Australian Federal Police, in coordination with the Australian Sanctions Office and Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), announced charges against a 34-year-old Western Sydney man for allegedly remitting approximately AUD 650,000 to Iranian banks subject to Australian sanctions. The individual, a director of a remittance company, is accused of processing 543 transactions over a 12-month period, facing a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and substantial fines. Following the investigation, AUSTRAC also suspended the company's remittance registration for one year. The Australian Sanctions Office warned members of the financial industry about the serious consequences of contravening national sanctions laws.

New Zealand Reimposes UN Sanctions on Iran Over Nuclear Non-Compliance

New Zealand announced the reimposition of United Nations-mandated sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's failure to comply with its nuclear obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The United Nations Sanctions (Iran) Regulations 2025, effective October 18, introduce measures including asset freezes and travel bans on designated individuals, import and export restrictions on nuclear and military goods, and a requirement for citizens to exercise vigilance in dealings with Iran. The government also confirmed a compulsory registration scheme for businesses engaging with Iran, set to commence on February 1, 2026. Foreign Minister Winston Peters emphasized that these steps reflect New Zealand's commitment to global non-proliferation efforts and urged Iran to resume full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

“Shipping needs international rules that are accepted by all, not punitive mechanisms,” said Greek Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy, Vasilis Kikilias. He added Greece had raised concerns regarding the NZF, proposing improvements to ensure it meets the real needs of shipping and reflects the realities of the global fuel market.

Last week’s negotiations, Mr Kikilias noted, highlighted weaknesses in the framework, including implementation timelines, the unfair treatment of LNG fuel, and unreasonably high penalties for shipping. “If adopted, they could potentially cause severe disruptions to global trade and increases in product prices,” he warned.

The minister concluded that over the next year, “significant negotiations are required, incorporating market perspectives with realism and fairness.”

Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS) president Melina Travlos echoed this view, noting the delay presents a new opportunity to shape a framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.

She added the lack of consensus “highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account.”

Serious objections from Greek owners

Several notable figures in Greek shipping had already voiced objections to the NZF following its approval at the MEPC 83 session in April 2025. At that time, Ms Travlos highlighted concerns over the feasibility of the targets, emphasising that transitional fuels such as LNG were not adequately recognised.

Last month, leading Greek shipping owners – including Maria Angelicoussis, George Procopiou, Evangelos Marinakis, George Economou, Peter Livanos and Dimitris Procopiou – co-signed a statement with other international shipowners, expressing “grave concerns” about the NZF.

The group stated that, as currently drafted, the regulation is not fit for purpose and would prevent the industry from fulfilling the emissions-reduction commitments it made in 2023.

According to their estimates, the NZF would raise US$20–30Bn annually by 2030, and could accumulate to more than US$300Bn by 2035 if the global fleet lags behind targets by as little as 10%.

“It is very difficult to accept adding fuel to inflation and passing it on to the consumer,” said one experienced Greek shipping executive.

Each year, the EU’s 27 countries unanimously agree a position for the annual climate conference, and an easy adoption of this year’s document was expected after Spanish and German concerns were addressed in the run-up to Tuesday’s ministerial in Luxembourg.

But Greece has suddenly threatened to block approval because the text, obtained earlier by Euractiv, “welcomes” the international shipping net-zero framework deal struck in April and which Athens refused to sign.

Three diplomats confirmed the blockage to Euractiv, with one diplomat saying that Athens is holding the deal “hostage”.

In Greece, where the shipping industry is a major influence, fighting against the deal has become important at the highest level and is in the hands of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The Net Zero framework deal was approved last April but not adopted by members of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) following a US intervention.

The line referring to the deal in the EU’s COP30 position paper was “irrelevant,” a source in Athens told Euractiv. The Net Zero Framework deal was frozen last week, and the text should therefore be “re-visited”.

A compromise on the text had yet to be found – any proposal to alter it would need to be signed off by Athens, one senior EU diplomat said.

Following pressure from the Americans, members of the IMO had failed to approve a deal pushing for an ambitious framework favouring green hydrogen-derived fuels (such as green ammonia and methanol) over LNG.

The EU had voted against the postponement of the deal, pitting Brussels against Washington. Greece and Cyprus, however, abstained during the vote.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.
To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework.
“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.
This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.","International nature conservation organisations Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia and Global Forest Coalition on Monday (20 October) urged the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to exclude harmful biofuels from compliance with the Net-Zero Framework.

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026.

But important discussions will continue on 20 to 24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organisations stressed the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.

“The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

“The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The organizations said the IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.

“The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

“The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade,” the organisations concluded.

Repsol on Monday (20 October) said it has signed a landmark eight-year agreement with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) to supply renewable marine fuels at the Port of Barcelona.

Beginning in the 2026 European cruise season, Repsol will offer a portfolio of renewable fuels – starting with biofuels and, from 2029, renewable methanol – directly to NCLH’s vessels across its cruise brands—Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises—when calling at the Port of Barcelona.

“This milestone agreement highlights that renewable fuels are ready to play a key role in reducing the carbon footprint of the maritime sector. By partnering with NCLH, one of the world’s leading cruise companies, we show that renewable fuels are already deployable at scale to immediately start reducing emissions at sea,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s Executive Managing Director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

“This partnership is an excellent example of how cross-industry collaboration can unlock meaningful progress,” said Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

“Securing long-term access to renewable marine fuels at a key European port aligns directly with our Sail & Sustain program and demonstrates our commitment to advancing towards a more sustainable future.”

The agreement between Repsol and NCLH was established based on the changing international regulatory environment and both companies’ pursuit of Net Zero by 2050. All fuels provided under the agreement are certified under the ISCC EU framework and meet the standards necessary to support NCLH’s environmental compliance and decarbonization roadmap.

The renewable methanol will be produced at Repsol’s Ecoplanta facility in Tarragona (Spain), a pioneering project in Europe to transform urban waste into renewable fuels and circular products, adding a solution for reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector, while at the same time promoting the circular economy.

The new plant—set to begin operations in 2029— will have the capacity to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste per year and turn them into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels and circular products. NCLH is the first company to sign an offtake agreement for renewable methanol from the Ecoplanta facility.

The maritime industry is facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape as it strives to meet decarbonisation targets, with new frameworks including the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime, alongside an upcoming IMO net zero framework, driving significant change, heard delegates at the Marine Fuels 360 conference in Singapore on Wednesday (8 October).

Kapil Berry, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV highlighted each new regulation presents a more intricate scenario than the last, making compliance and strategic planning crucial for shipowners during his presentation ‘Leveraging Technology for Decarbonisation’.

“Though biofuels are currently considered the easiest drop-in bunker fuels to meet immediate compliance needs for FuelEU Maritime and IMO net zero goals, technological solutions remain at the forefront of this transition,” informed Berry.

He shared Wind-Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS), encompassing designs such as rotor sails and rigid wings, can achieve 5-20% fuel savings when installed. However, their implementation requires careful consideration of trading areas, air drafts, deck strengthening, and potential impacts on bridge visibility, with planning often needing at least two years before drydocking.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is also emerging as a significant pathway. Projections from DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast report suggest if 20 major ports establish offloading facilities and the largest bulk carriers, containerships, and tankers are fitted with CCS, it could offload approximately 90% of emissions from those vessels. This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.

Beyond advanced technologies, energy efficiency measures are emphasised as the “lowest hanging fruits” that can be implemented immediately, stated Berry.

He pointed out a DNV publication detailing over 40 energy efficiency technologies suggesting potential savings of up to 16% for shipowners.

Crucially, the transition towards net-zero shipping demands robust data management, believed Berry.

“The shift from manual reporting to automated, standardised, and verified data flows is essential for compliance with ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and net zero frameworks, as decisions involving millions or billions of dollars hinge on accurate data,” he said.

“To support the industry, DNV has developed a long-standing expert service available via email, providing responses within 24 hours, or four hours for urgent queries, routed through global data centres.”

French shipping company Sogestran Group recently said it has selected China Merchants Industry Yangzhou Dingheng Shipyard to build two new bunker vessels for long-time partner Petroineos.

Partners for over 34 years, Petroineos and Sogestran’s subsidiary Maritima are renewing their fleet dedicated to bunkering operations in the Fos, Marseille, and Toulon areas, reaffirming their local presence in the south of France.

Petroineos and Maritima will commission vessels for conventional bunkering and ready to supply low carbon fuels – B24, B100, HVO, e-Methanol.

The new bunker vessels will replace the current units – Florence B, Tatiana B, and Cap Pinede.

Their design has been specifically developed to optimise access to the Petroineos refinery jetties in Lavera. Each vessel will have a cargo capacity of 4,500 m³.

They will feature diesel-electric propulsion, powered by three electronically managed generator sets that adjust consumption to the vessel’s operational needs – a technical choice particularly well suited for ships operating over relatively short distances, and already adopted by Sogestran Group for the Pointe de Caux, launched in 2022.

The vessels will be equipped with two electric azimuth thrusters at the stern and a bow tunnel thruster, ensuring optimal manoeuvrability.

They will also be fitted with shore power connections and mass flow meters for quantity delivery monitoring.

Located on the Yangtze River, about 250 km from Shanghai, the shipyard specialises in vessels designed for the transport of oil and chemical products.

The designer of the bunker vessels is Deltamarin Shanghai. Steel cutting for the first vessel is scheduled for November 2026, with launch in 2027 and delivery in early 2028.

Against the backdrop of increasingly stringent international emission regulations and growing industry commitment to sustainability, the report provides insights into green shipping, covering IMO, EU, China and other nations’ initiatives, along with advancements in clean energy, emission reduction technologies, carbon trading and green ports.

Tightening global policy of green port and shipping

In 2024, the global economy remained under pressure from geopolitical risks and a high interest rate environment persist, though economic resilience has been enhanced. According to the International Monetary Fund’s (ITF) latest forecast, global growth is expected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly below the 3.3% in 2023. The World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts that global trade volume will grow by 2.7% in 2024, well above the downturn of 2023.

In this context, the global port and shipping industry faces a further increasing pressure of green environmental policy, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) continues to advance its strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships and has put forward a draft of the “Net-Zero Framework”; The EU brought shipping into the carbon emissions trading system (EU ETS); the United States advanced cleaner port legislation and funding; and China has also issued stricter green port policy.

In the future, green environmental policies targeting the port and shipping industry will continue to be strengthened, the harbor and shipping enterprises face great pressure, green and low-carbon transformation has become the inevitable path for industry development.

The gradual scale-up of carbon trading market

Carbon trading markets are being established around the world since turning GHG emissions rights represented by carbon dioxide into commodities in the 1997 Kyoto agreement. According to the Global Carbon Market Progress Report issued by the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP), two new global carbon markets have been added in 2024, and by the end of the year, 38 carbon trading systems have been established, covering 23% GHG emissions, 58% of global GDP and one third of the world’ population with systems under consideration and development;.

The EU ETS remains the world’s largest market, with shipping officially incorporated into the EU carbon trading system from January 2024. The trading scale of China’s carbon emission allowances continues to expand, and the national voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction trading (CCER) market will be restarted. In the future, the carbon trading market will become the primary regulatory mechanism for emission reduction of port and maritime industry.

Abundant application of marine clean energy

By September 2025, marine clean energy is still dominated by LNG, the volume of LNG and methanol is significantly increased, orders for hydrogen fuel ships are increased, ammonia fuel is distributed in major ports around the world, hydrogen fuel-cell technology is constantly maturing, and the price of biofuel is falling.

Totally, 210 ports worldwide can provide LNG refueling services. Singapore Port, as one of the main LNG refueling ports, saw a year-on-year increase of 318% in LNG refueling volume in 2024; 23 ports can provide methanol refueling services for ships. Among them, the methanol refueling volume of Rotterdam Port increased rapidly, with a year-on-year growth of 426% in 2024 and 894% in the first half of 2025. The first ammonia-fueled vessels are expected around 2026-2027, and pilot ammonia bunkering has been completed in Singapore, Rotterdam, Yokohama and Dalian ports.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that, at present, renewable energy accounts for less than 4% of energy consumption in the transportation sector, but transport renewable demand could grow by around 3 EJ in 2024-2030 (about double the amount of previous six years).

Biofuels are regarded as a key energy source for reducing emissions in the shipping and aviation industries achieving a 2050 near-zero pathway implies raising biofuels’ share in transport energy from the current 6% toward 20%. In addition, with the continuous improvement of shore power facilities, the emission requirements of ships in ports will become stricter, and ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future.

Flourishing development of energy saving and emission reduction technologies

With the strengthening of environmental protection rules, there is a strong market demand for energy-efficiency and emission reduction technologies. Under such circumstances, the ship energy saving and emission reduction technology is increasingly abundant, in addition to various clean energy sources, there are more than 50 common energy-efficiency and emission reduction technologies including technical measures and various operation measures, and new technologies are still emerging. DNV predicts that by 2030, the shipping industry can reduce fuel consumption by 4% -16% through applicable technical measures and operation measures.

Typical technical measures include hull optimization, wind-assisted propulsion system, solar power and propeller optimization. Such emerging technologies can effectively improve fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions, but generally face the problems of higher CAPEX, longer payback time, higher maintenance cost and high requirements for ships and ports. Therefore, in adopting such technical measures, the shipowners need to balance cost against lifetime savings and regulatory benefits.

Operation measures mainly include route optimization, trim optimization, speed optimization and automatic driving. Such measures, which are often supported by digital decarbonization technologies to support ship operation decisions, have become an integral part of modern ship operations. In general, the technologies with remarkable emission reduction effect, high technical maturity, good adaptability, convenient installation and short payback time are more likely favored by the market. Over time, market tested technologies will be more widely applied.

The decarbonization of shipping is not only a regulatory necessity but also an opportunity to reimagine the future of maritime transport.

As the global fleet’s fuel transition to green fuels is still ramping up, energy efficiency improvements are promising short-term solutions.
#3 Energy efficiency measures can reduce the total cost of the maritime energy transition by up to about $220 billion per year.
Improving the energy efficiency of the global merchant fleet is insufficient to meet the IMO’s policy objectives alone.","As explained, to better understand the tapped or untapped potential of technical and operational energy efficiency measures for maritime transport, and how this can help reduce transport costs for developing countries in the energy transition, the “Keys to Energy-Efficient Shipping” report addresses four main questions:

What is the overall contribution of energy efficiency measures to meeting the IMO’s checkpoints and net-zero target on the path to 2050 for the global fleet and main ship types?

What is the contribution of individual energy efficiency measures to cut GHG emissions, and how cost-effective are they?

How can energy efficiency contribute to a cost-effective energy transition pathway, and how do they work in conjunction with the long-term fuel transition?

What are the remaining barriers to maximizing energy efficiency in shipping, and what are the possible solutions?

Key findings

Following the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the report sets out four key findings for policymakers and industry to consider:

#1 Energy efficiency measures can reduce ship emissions by up to about 40 percent in 2030, exceeding the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) policy objectives.

Technical and operational energy efficiency measures offer a maximum potential to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 23–39 percent in 2030 relative to 2008 levels, clearly exceeding the IMO’s base level of ambition of 20 percent in 2030 and at a maximum exceeding the IMO’s high-level ambition of 30 percent.

The largest untapped potential in the short term lies in ship speed reductions for the overall fleet, reducing GHG emissions by 5–15 percent, with additional savings achievable by optimizing voyage speed into congested ports. Beyond 2030, the contribution of technical measures, such as changes in ship design and the addition of new equipment, is expected to increase.

As the global fleet’s fuel transition to green fuels is still ramping up, energy efficiency improvements are promising short-term solutions. While energy efficiency measures are insufficient to meet the IMO’s 2050 target—at a maximum lowering GHG emissions to about 40 percent below 2008 levels—they will also complement the fuel transition beyond 2030 and reduce ships’ reliance on fossil fuel.

#2 About half of emissions savings from energy efficiency measures are considered cost-effective in 2030, cutting 250 million tons of emissions at no cost.

By 2030, cost-effective energy efficiency measures could fully pay for themselves by lowering shipping’s fuel costs. For bulk carriers, container ships, and tankers—which account for nearly 80 percent of shipping GHG emissions—the majority of energy efficiency measures are cost-effective. However, marginal abatement costs for individual measures vary by ship type, primarily due to differences in ship design and operational requirements.

Tankers have the least cost-effective abatement due to relatively higher installation costs of technologies and technical limitations when reducing speed. Bulk carriers offer favorable design features for wind-assisted propulsion, while container ships show high abatement effectiveness in reducing speed.

#3 Energy efficiency measures can reduce the total cost of the maritime energy transition by up to about $220 billion per year.

Improving the energy efficiency of the global merchant fleet is insufficient to meet the IMO’s policy objectives alone. Therefore, green fuels, such as methanol and ammonia, will be indispensable in 2040 and 2050 but are more expensive than conventional fuels. A cost-efficient route to meeting the sector’s GHG emissions targets is to prioritize energy efficiency, which reduces the fuel consumption of the fleet and, therefore, the overall cost of the transition. Annual capital investments in energy efficiency across the fleet of about $35 billion can save up to $270 billion in green fuel costs per year.

Investments in energy efficiency measures also offer mitigation to fuel price volatility and will be a critical component of the fuel transition when green fuels are still more expensive.

#4 Despite their potential, several top candidate energy efficiency measures in merchant shipping remain underused because of sector-specific economic, behavioral, and organizational barriers.

While promising, some of the candidate measures with the highest GHG emissions savings and lowest uptake—such as wind-assisted ship propulsion, air lubrication, and port call optimization (PCO)—remain untapped to date. An explanation for the lack of investment and implementation of cost-effective measures is due to known economic, behavioral, and organizational barriers, which are also common barriers to implementing energy efficiency improvements in other sectors.

Specifically, imperfect information, split incentives, and asymmetric information are the most significant market failures, while non-market failures such as access to capital, hidden costs, perceptions of technology risk, and market heterogeneity contribute to the lack of uptake of technical measures. Behavioral and organizational barriers are particularly important to address to increase the uptake of PCO by ports and the shipping industry.

Action points

Energy efficiency has significant potential for global shipping but remains largely untapped to date. While there are public- and private-led initiatives underway, significant barriers persist. How can the remaining barriers be addressed, and who is best placed to lead such efforts?

Policymakers

Regulatory bodies set the standards for the safety, security, and environmental performance of ships. They play a major role in creating an enabling environment for realizing the full potential of energy efficiency.

Advance performance standards: Performance standards have been the backbone of a uniquely regulated global shipping sector. They hold some of the greatest potential to address longstanding market failures and barriers, such as information barriers, which prevent firms from responding only to price signals. International performance standards (for example, EEDI, CII) can be strengthened and considered by IMO member states in their future work plans.

Explore alternative instruments: Other instruments (for example, emission levies, subsidies) can also provide additional demand- and supply-side incentives, especially as there is growing recognition that a combination of multiple climate policy instruments may be needed to decarbonize industries. The large untapped potential of energy efficiency, especially to help make shipping costs more resilient to absolute fuel price volatility, rerouting shocks, and fuel transition cost, presents an opportunity for national, regional, and international policymakers.

Industry

The shipping industry is both an enabler and beneficiary of increased energy efficiency. Actors range from shipowners and shippers to equipment manufacturers.

Develop information standards: Alongside regulatory intervention, voluntary information standards can complement policies to help address imperfect information market failures and harmonize data exchange. Industry initiatives can help innovative technologies gain market acceptance. Validation guidelines for technology performance, and ultimately fuel savings, are important to grow investor confidence through consistent terminology (ITTC 2024).

Foster demonstration projects: Third-party verified data on technology demonstrations in real operating conditions would also help improve access to capital and increase the business case for charterers and shipowners.

Ports and port community

Port stakeholders are critical actors to foster the uptake of promising port-centric energy efficiency measures, such as port call optimization, and infrastructure-related options such as onshore power supply.

Explore national or local policies: National and local (port) policies can encourage these port development activities by considering how regulatory instruments can be used, as ports do not traditionally fall under the regulatory realm of the IMO.

Share best practices: Learnings from ports that are more advanced in implementing port call optimization can help those at earlier stages of implementation to address adoption challenges. This is especially important for ports operating under a landlord model where private terminals control berth planning data.

Adopt digital solutions: These initiatives can be supported by software systems such as port community systems or maritime single windows, which facilitate data sharing across multiple stakeholders. Adoption of global digital data standards that establish definitions of port locations and port call timestamps from universally accepted IMO and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards is crucial to improve communication on port calls and arrival times between ship operators and ports, enabling port call optimization.

Finance

As uptake lags, access to capital is essential for financing investments in energy efficiency technologies and systems, both on board ships and at port facilities.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sustainability-shutterstock_2164376069-e1761037135888.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 06:16:42.469145

The proposal has drawn worldwide criticism for its from economic impacts and threats to national sovereignty.

The tax, called for by the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO), would require major shipping companies to pay them fees for their carbon emissions beginning in 2027. The Trump administration will not allow the U.N. “to tax American companies or citizens for simply doing business,” Rubio vowed.

“The United States will not cede economic authority to an international body,” the Secretary of State said. “This so-called climate tax would raise energy, food, and fuel prices while enriching the U.N. bureaucracy.” He is urging other countries to join the U.S. in rejecting the plan to defend national sovereignty and economic independence.

Under the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, large oceangoing vessels would be forced to transition to low-emission fuels or face heavy penalties. Companies emitting beyond designated limits would pay between $100 and $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, depending on the ship’s size, efficiency, and type of fuel used. The framework would be legally binding for the IMO’s 176 member nations, including the United States, which has been a member since 1950.

The State Department last week threatened to impose port fees, trade restrictions, or sanctions on countries that adopt the measure. “We’re not going to allow unelected international bureaucrats to dictate America’s energy policy,” Rubio said.

According to the IMO, funds collected under the tax would support low-emission technologies, “just transition” projects in developing nations, and financial incentives for greener ships. Critics argue the plan amounts to a massive global redistribution scheme, with potential revenue estimated up to $12 billion annually, and warn it could disadvantage American companies in the global market.",https://dd3vw9csp56u7.cloudfront.net/assets/southshorepress/favicon/favicon-32x32-3b6b58244d297f3523a157800cd2a45f5770adfe72a0e6604a1a1afc060eb73b.png,N,,2025-10-21 06:16:47.126410

The Jefferies analysts point to a trend where dual fueled capable vessel orders had moved in the direction of LNG, with growing concerns as to the widespread availability of methanol, and the safety of ammonia.
They note that: “This was most obvious with the large wave of containership newbuilding orders placed last year, in which industry giants ordered LNG dual-fuel ships after previously focusing on methanol.""
Citing data from Clarksons, Jefferies said that: “Dual Fuel / Alternative propulsion makes up 41% of the orderbook,” as measured by CGT (though only 16% in the orderbook would be able to use an alternative fuel immediately upon entering service).
In contrast, on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers that face little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and domestic exporters.” Resource:","In the aftermath of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision to postpone adoption of its proposed Net Zero Framework, analysts of shipping equities, but also observers of the broader energy marketplace, are weighing in on the possible impacts regarding the actual shipping markets.

Jefferies’ analyst Omar Nokta and his team published a group of reports touching on the practical implications; the bottom line, as stated in a report issued on the Monday following the IMO’s retreat the previous Friday, is that: “We expect a consequence of last week's indecision will be a shift back to conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders and for many of those currently in the orderbook.”

They asserted that “The IMO's goal of reducing GHG emissions by 40% relative to 2008 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are now at risk.”

In the interactions of vessel supply and vessel demand, uncertainty regarding suitable fuels had arguably reduced the magnitude of new orders in recent years, as the IMO was on its course towards a longer-term plan for incentivizing alternative fuels. A variant on this line of thinking suggested that the magnitude of ordering for dual fueled vessels or alternatively fueled ships had been constrained since the dual fueled assets are more expensive than their conventionally fueled counterparts.

The Jefferies analysts point to a trend where dual fueled capable vessel orders had moved in the direction of LNG, with growing concerns as to the widespread availability of methanol, and the safety of ammonia. They note that: “This was most obvious with the large wave of containership newbuilding orders placed last year, in which industry giants ordered LNG dual-fuel ships after previously focusing on methanol.""

The data on the subject is nuanced. The Jefferies team discuss dual fuel “capable” vessels able to run on alternative fuel at the time of delivery, suggesting that this type of flexibility adds $10-15 million to the construction cost, compared to a conventionally fueled vessel or a dual fuel “ready” ship, where actual alternative fueling systems might be added at a later date. Citing data from Clarksons, Jefferies said that: “Dual Fuel / Alternative propulsion makes up 41% of the orderbook,” as measured by CGT (though only 16% in the orderbook would be able to use an alternative fuel immediately upon entering service).

They suggest that: “We expect many to shift their dual-fuel ""capable"" newbuildings to dual-fuel ""ready"" to lower capex, especially for 2027 and onward deliveries (when engine changes can still be made). If there is one benefit to the IMO's stalled initiatives, it is that shipping costs may be coming down.”

Analysts from the Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), looking at geopolitics rather than shipping markets but benefitting from previous affiliations with a leading New York headquartered shipbroker in the LNG and gas marketplace) note that impacts on shipping companies are far from uniform.

They write that: “Large shipping firms are considerably more likely to be able to absorb the added cost of remedial units and retrofitting their fleet, and to be able to endure the initial discomfort of an inevitable lack of supply within the low-emissions fuel market. With access to capital and larger fleets, they can retrofit vessels, secure scarce supplies of low-emission fuels, and use credit trading to offset penalties, effectively balancing the costs of older, less-efficient ships against the performance of those already prepared to run on green methanol or ammonia.” The discussion notes that smaller operators might potentially be disadvantaged.

The Jefferies equity analysts are implicitly voicing the same sentiment, mentioning at least one “industry giant” in their discussions of vessel ordering rationale, as they noted: “The uncertainty on future propulsion has been a key reason many in the industry have shied away from ordering new vessels while others, including Maersk, had hoped infrastructure investments to make alternative fuels more available would justify methanol or ammonia powered vessels.”

The Columbia University scholars also hinted at different impacts across different routes, saying: “On highly competitive routes, carriers have an incentive to absorb part of the compliance costs in order to protect their market share. In contrast, on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers that face little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and domestic exporters.”

More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve the deal first announced in April 2025. However, the US administration was vociferous in its criticism of the scheme, with president Donald Trump going as far as threatening tariffs on countries that voted in favour of it. Ultimately, a motion to delay by a year was passed.

April’s agreement had meant that from 2028 ship operators would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. Champions of the deal welcomed a global standard for marine shipping emissions. Some detractors voiced concerns around raised prices for consumers, while others stated that it did not go far enough to address the climate crisis.

Ultimately, many large shipowners/operators, primarily in the container business, have advanced with newbuilding schemes that lean into alternative fuels. With skin in the game, it’s hard to see them reversing those investments on the basis of a one-year delay. However, it does beg the question of what smaller, niche carriers will do with regard to fleet renewal.

The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reached a new milestone on Monday (20 October).

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

The corridor partners presented their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025 on 20 October.

The report highlighted the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 metric tonnes (mt) of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realised China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol. Ports of LA and Long Beach are preparing for a methanol pilot project.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

Addressing the future of clean marine fuels due to the shifting regulatory, permitting, and policy landscape, such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Addressing market uncertainty on clean marine fuel supply and demand.

While some in the maritime industry has expressed disappointment as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed its global Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for another year, others said the time should be used to close remaining gaps and further develop it.

NZF includes a global fuel standard for shipping and an economic measure, which consists of a pricing mechanism and credit trading scheme to drive down emissions and fund the transition to zero and low carbon fuels.

IBIA had expected, together with a significant number of international associations, a different outcome of the extraordinary MEPC.

“The MEPC Special Session this week demonstrated that the issue of reducing GHG emissions from ships, and in particular, the pricing of emissions, is politically contentious for many countries to the point that achieving a consensus at this stage is not possible and means the draft amendments for consideration will now have to be revised before being tabled again and pausing it for one year,” IBIA said in a statement.

IBIA supported the adoption of the NZF and were already engaged in crucial work on the detailed guidelines.

“Meanwhile, a majority of IMO’s Member States weren’t prepared to move ahead, making shipping the first sector with a global regulatory framework to decarbonise,” IBIA added.

“A working group meeting at IMO next week to prepare implementing guidelines will see an attempt to heal the diplomatic scars of this week.”

“IBIA will continue to support IMO and its work, and in doing so, represent the views of the whole of the marine energy supply chain.”

The International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) considered the postponement of the adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework as a major setback for a global framework that the industry needs to secure investments in decarbonisation at sea and on land.

IAPH managing director Patrick Verhoeven, said: “This is a major setback for the maritime industry. Shipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation.

“Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

“The adjournment of the IMO Net Zero Framework now spells uncertainty about the incentives that are needed for the uptake of new low and zero carbon fuels.”

Thomas A. Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) Secretary General, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) has underlined the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

“The IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. We are committed to continuing work with governments to deliver the necessary regulatory consistency, support renewable fuel production and infrastructure, and keep shipping’s energy transition on track,” the council said.

International nature conservation organisations Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia and Global Forest Coalition on Monday (20 October) urged the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to exclude harmful biofuels from compliance with the Net-Zero Framework.

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026.

But important discussions will continue on 20 to 24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organisations stressed the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.

“The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

“The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The organizations said the IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.

“The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

“The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade,” the organisations concluded.

With the limited supply, they fear the next alternative will be indirect land use change biofuels, contributing to crop displacement and food insecurity.","Timed to the start of the working group session of MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) protestors have returned to the front of the IMO’s London headquarters, this time to demand an end to biofuels. The effort launched as the discussions continue about refining the framework for net-zero and just days after the IMO member states adjourned the discussion for the adoption for one year.

The working group is meeting behind closed doors to tackle some of the elements of the framework and fuels will be high on their agenda. Groups named Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia, and Global Forest Coalition teamed up demanding that biofuels be excluded from the Net-Zero Framework.

The groups are calling attention to deforestation which they say biofuel is contributing to and accelerating in parts of the world. They assert that the land use change for crops such as palm oil and soy, to support biofuels wipe out claims of climate benefits. They also point to the growing issues of agricultural displacement and food insecurity demanding that the IMO exclude biofuels from the green alternatives in the Net-Zero Framework.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances,” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition. “If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing.”

The groups point to data released earlier this year by the NGO T&E that said international shipping could become the fourth largest biofuel consumer, driving more demand for biofuels coming from food and feed crops. T&E estimated that biofuels could make up more than a third (36 percent) of the global fuel mix by 2030 with the share increased to 59 percent by 2035 and 76 percent by 2040. It would be mostly derived from soy and palm oil.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch. “The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions.”

The groups fear because it is a lower cost alternative, used cooking oil biofuel will attract strong demand far beyond its capacity. They note that the supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuel production, they assert, could only meet about five percent of shipping’s energy demand. With the limited supply, they fear the next alternative will be indirect land use change biofuels, contributing to crop displacement and food insecurity.

But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.
Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost.
We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.” Photo credit: iStock/ Tran Van Quyet","As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition expressed its huge disappointment in the decision by member states to delay consideration of the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for one year and called on member states to use the time to ensure the framework is strengthened and adopted next time round.

John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at IMO, said: “By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.

“With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.

“However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.

“There’s no time to waste, at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.

“While the Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect, adopting it would have been an important step to deliver on the IMOs commitment and send key signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal.”

The IMO’s NZF is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard, requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

Elissama Menezes, co-founder and director, Equal Routes, said: “Delay costs the climate — and coastal, Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction.

“This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.

“Implementing revised CII targets to improve efficiency of the global fleet; investing in wind to promote its scaling up; agreeing to comprehensive well to wake LCA guidelines which ensure all methane-based fuels aren’t part of decarbonation pathways; and adopting mandatory measures in early 2026 at PPR13 to reduce black carbon from shipping emissions can all be moved on now to support the sector’s zero by 2050 ambitions.” LCA refers to life cycle assessment.

Alison Shaw, IMO manager, Transport & Environment, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.

“The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonization. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer, Seas At Risk, said: “Getting the NZF adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets.

“Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

Jenny Helle, expert on decarbonization of aviation and shipping, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The adoption of NZF would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition.

“Far from rushed, it represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort. It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public. Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost. We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.”

The draft regulations include a global fuel standard and global economic measure.
Under the global fuel standard, ships would be required to recue their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time.

In the interim, UN member states will continue to work towards consensus on the framework.

The IMO is a specialized agency of the UN that regulates maritime transport. The organization in April 2025 took a step toward establishing a legally binding framework to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships globally, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by or near 2050. The proposed framework is the first of its kind to combine mandatory emissions limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector.

The Net Zero Framework was approved by the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in April. A vote to formally adopt the framework was expected to be held during the extraordinary session of the MEPC, which convened Oct. 14-17. The IMO, however, on Oct. 17 announced efforts to formally adopt the framework will be delayed for one year, with the extraordinary session set to reconvene in October 2026. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet Oct. 20-24, will go ahead an continue to work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework.

The framework, as approved in April, was expected to enter into force in 2027 and be mandatory for large ocean-going ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage, which the IMO said emit 85% of total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

The draft regulations include a global fuel standard and global economic measure. Under the global fuel standard, ships would be required to recue their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time. GHG reductions would be calculated using a well-to-wake approach. Under the global economic measures, ships emitting above the GFI thresholds would have to acquire remedial units to balance its deficit emissions, while those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies would be eligible for financial rewards. The proposal included two levels of compliance with GFI targets, including a base target and a direct compliance target at which ships would be eligible to earn surplus units.

Adoption of the ICO’s Net Zero Framework was expected to boost demand for biobased fuels, according to comments made by U.S. renewable fuel producers ahead of the Oct. 17 vote. According to Roeslein Renewables, the framework could significantly boost demand for renewable natural gas (RNG)-based fuels and biodiesel. Vanguard Renewables also noted the framework was expected to boost RNG demand while the U.S. Grains & Bioproducts Council stressed the framework could create new opportunities for the ethanol industry.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2012/10/ShipBulkCarrier_13498013901506.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 20:16:33.766529

Three Cabinet secretaries have issued a warning to other countries not to approve the so-called Net Zero Framework (NZF), which is generally considered to be a carbon tax on global shipping.

See here for the text of the warning.

The IMO was supposed to pass the NZF at its October meeting, but the Trump warning had a clear effect, so that vote never happened. All they did was vote to postpone voting on the emission reduction compliance program until the next meeting. Now the fight really begins.

NZF is not actually a tax, just penalties for failing to meet agreed-on emission limits, but it is still potentially costly so call it a tax. The IMO fact sheet is here.

Basically, each ship gets an assigned cap on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy expended. The caps get progressively lower over time, heading for zero in 2050.

If a ship gets below its cap it gets “surplus unit” (SU) credits for the difference that it can sell. If it exceeds the cap a little it must buy “Tier 1 remedial units (RU)” from IMO. If it exceeds the cap a lot it can either buy SUs or Tier 2 RUs which cost about four times as much as Tier 1 RUs.

It is buying the remedial units that amounts to a carbon tax on emissions, which by some estimates will be enormous. The Trump administration said in a press release that America “unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.”

Decarbonization of shipping is pretty much impossible, because it cannot be electrified. The sea lanes cannot be lined with charging stations. Refitting every ship in the world with nuclear propulsion would be even more expensive. Burning wood or corn might be even worse.

The net-zero thinkers are not known for reality, but, in this case, the greater the failure the more money they make. No wonder they like it!

Nor can the U.S. just walk away because shipping is truly global. Here is how the IMO fact sheet explains enforcement of things like NZF:

“Enforcement of all IMO regulations lies with the Member States, in their capacity as flag, port or coastal States. When a government accedes to an IMO Convention, it agrees to make it part of its own national law and to enforce it just like any other law. A Flag State must ensure that ships under its registry comply with IMO’s international rules and standards, including safety, environmental protection and labour conditions. A Port State has the right to inspect foreign ships in national ports to verify that compliance with IMO rules.”

How do foreign ports enforce NZF compliance on American ships? Or any ships for that matter. There is real potential for violence here, with a lot of money at stake.

Clearly the potential for disruption from the ill-conceived UN IMO NZF is enormous, and the fight is just beginning. Stay tuned to CFACT as this drama unfolds.",https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Container-ship-dollars.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:25.257830

We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition.
As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it.","A scheduled Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee has ended without adopting the policy measures agreed upon in principle in April 2025. These measures are intended to reduce emissions from the shipping sector and kick-start the sector’s energy transition.

The meeting failed to complete the next milestone toward the entry into force of the “Net Zero Framework”. In the decision taken at the end of the week, a vote was called for by Saudi Arabia to adjourn the meeting for one year. The vote resulted in 57 countries accepting the motion, forming a majority of those present and voting, and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

A vote was also called at the MEPC 83 meeting in April 2025, agreeing in principle to the legal amendment to MARPOL Annex VI. A number of countries changed their positions relative to that vote, providing evidence that well-publicised threats from the United States, including tariffs and reprisals for any country that supported the Framework, and related pressure, were effective at changing positions. On this occasion, that pressure appears to have been effective.

Dr Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The adoption of the Net Zero Framework by the IMO would have marked a crucial step forward for shipping decarbonization. Although adoption has been postponed, the process remains underway, with key technical guidelines now the focus before potential adoption in 2026.”

The decision on the IMO’s Net Zero Framework does not override or change the foundation of the GHG Reduction Strategy that was adopted at MEPC 80 in 2023. This unanimously adopted strategy commits the organisation to absolute GHG emission reductions of 20-30% in 2030 and 70-80% in 2040, on a pathway to reaching net-zero emissions by/around 2050. As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it. However the outcome at IMO means further work on regional and national regulation of international shipping has now been vindicated, making current regulations such as those in EU likely to be prolonged. We could now see more regions taking similar action.

Dr Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This unexpected delay highlights both the complexity and the high stakes of reaching global alignment on shipping’s net-zero transition. The year ahead offers a vital window for constructive engagement and for strengthening the evidence base to ensure that when the framework is finally adopted, it is both equitable and actionable across diverse national contexts.”",,N,,2025-10-20 23:16:34.078362

Although biofuels create far fewer emissions in transport than standard oil-based fuels, many still come at significant environmental costs, since their production can release carbon through deforestation and intensive farming practices that offset much of their supposed climate benefit. An analysis commissioned by the European Union in 2015 found that, in some cases, converting farmland to grow mass amounts of soy and palm oil creates more emissions than burning fossil fuels.

In Indonesia, large-scale expansion of oil palm plantations in order to meet global biofuel demand has driven widespread deforestation and peatland loss. According to Human Rights Watch, peatlands in Indonesia store roughly 80 billion tons of carbon, and when they are burned to clear the way for palm oil cultivation, that carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing massive spikes in greenhouse gas emissions, and creating toxic haze events that have blanketed much of Southeast Asia in recent decades.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots,” said Forest Watch Indonesia campaigner Anggi Putra Prayoga.

The IMO has agreed to adjourn the extraordinary session of the MEPC, which was convened Oct. 14-17, to consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO net-zero framework.

The extraordinary session will be reconvened in 12 months.

In the interim, member states will continue to work towards consensus on the IMO framework.

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet Oct. 20-24, will continue work on the guidelines for implementing the net-zero framework, IMO stated.

The net-zero framework was approved at the MEPC 83 session in April, as a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

It comprises a set of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with IMO’s 2023 strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from ships.

It includes two key elements: a global fuel standard and global GHG-emissions pricing mechanism.

Various organizations responded to the IMO’s decision to delay the adoption of the framework.

The Singapore-based Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization said on Oct. 17, “The team at GCMD, while disappointed by the outcome at MEPC last night, woke up with renewed resolve this morning. The industry faces a complex journey—one that requires us to be pragmatic yet forward-looking. GCMD’s approach will continue to reflect the reality of a heterogeneous sector: running alongside frontrunners who push technological boundaries, supporting followers who seek commercial certainty, and enabling conservatives who are ready to embark on their decarbonization strategy. Fundamentally, GCMD believes nothing has changed in the industry’s ultimate destination: net-zero emissions. Regional efforts, such as EU regulations, remain in force and are expanding, and other regions will likely also step up to take leadership in light of what happened last night. While a global framework would have provided uniform clarity sooner, the direction of travel is clear and should drive action—the work does not stop simply because the vote is postponed.”

Lloyd’s Register said the IMO’s adoption of the framework “would have provided a global regulatory framework for the reduction of GHG energy intensity of international shipping.”

Lloyd’s Register further added that it believes “the least disruptive and most equitable route for the maritime industry’s energy transition is through a global, multilateral, transparent policy with the IMO. This will provide the framework for how the industry should decarbonize, creating the consistency, confidence and collaboration needed to drive investment and accelerate progress. It will be seen in the coming weeks what actions the IMO member states will take in this matter.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_ee15dc8d9f474173a86b2ed514101d5f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_474,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/80995f_ee15dc8d9f474173a86b2ed514101d5f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 21:01:34.897157

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026. But important discussions will continue on 20–24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organizations stress the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia. “The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

The example of Indonesia should be a warning to other countries. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations for biofuel continues to drive deforestation – even within protected and conservation forests which are highly vulnerable to climate change. “The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch, “the science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

Recent research estimates that while used cooking oil (UCO) will be the cheapest pathway for compliance, its supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuels production could only meet about 5% of shipping’s energy demand, leaving the sector reliant on the next-cheapest compliance pathway, high-ILUC biofuels, with major sustainability risks. UCO and palm derivatives, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), have been associated with fraud, weak auditing and risk displacement from their current use, increasing the use of unsustainable palm oil elsewhere.

The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Credits__Biofuelwatch.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:39.377171

The IMO, through the Net Zero Framework, is estimated to raise as much as $10 billion a year through carbon levies on the global shipping industry.
NZF supporters often argue that a global industry needs global regulation, and that without it we’ll face a patchwork of regional rules.
We’re living in a fragmented, multipolar world.","A fragmented, multipolar approach to decarbonization might actually fit our fragmented, multipolar world better.

By James Lightbourn — While there’s plenty of soul-searching underway among supporters of the world’s first proposed carbon tax, its one-year delay could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — and perhaps an acknowledgment that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and, in turn, the United Nations (U.N.), might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.

To understand what happened, and where we go from here, we need to understand the rationale behind the American-led rebellion against the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

The reason behind the NZF outcome is simple: “money”.

U.S. messaging around its opposition to the NZF focused on the potential cost to American consumers. But that argument rang hollow — especially since recently announced U.S. tariffs and fees on Chinese-built ships will likely have a similar effect.

However, the U.S.’ more compelling oppositional argument runs deeper and reflects waning confidence in the U.N. Even though it is headquartered in New York, only 32% of Americans believe it does a good job. Those figures are even worse amongst Republicans, 70% of whom believe the U.S. should decrease its funding of the U.N.

This is where the paradox starts to emerge.

The U.N. has an annual operating budget of $3.7 billion. The U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. and was assessed to be responsible for 22% of the regular budget, or $820 million in 2025. The Trump administration’s 2026 budget request seeks to withhold that contribution entirely.

The IMO, through the Net Zero Framework, is estimated to raise as much as $10 billion a year through carbon levies on the global shipping industry.

There would, no doubt, be tensions between a cash-strapped parent organization – the U.N. – and a cash-rich subsidiary – the IMO. This raises legitimate questions as to whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the U.N. ‘s operating budget.

The U.N.’s financial situation (and the U.S.’ reluctance to fund it) aside, there was also the thorny question as to how the IMO would prudently allocate funds to support the decarbonization of the shipping sector without being heavy-handed in picking winners and losers amongst shipowners and fuel technologies.

With the NZF vote delayed, what is going to happen next?

NZF supporters often argue that a global industry needs global regulation, and that without it we’ll face a patchwork of regional rules.

But is that really such a bad outcome?

The European Union — one of the NZF’s biggest proponents — has already gone its own way, adding shipping to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and launching FuelEU Maritime. Brussels said that it would revisit those programs if the NZF passed, but never said exactly how. With the global plan now on hold, the EU framework remains intact. Similarly, African nations, led by Djibouti, have launched the African Sovereign Carbon Registry to collect fees from shipping companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions while calling their ports.

Other nations and regions are likely to follow suit. Yes, compliance will get more complex — but shipping companies already navigate a web of local regulations every time they arrive in port. Adding emissions requirements to that list won’t grind global trade to a halt.

Localized frameworks also ensure that the funds collected stay closer to the people and places most affected. Governments can decide how carbon revenues influence their own economies, export competitiveness, and consumer prices. And they can move faster — without waiting for consensus from 175 IMO member states.

We’re living in a fragmented, multipolar world. A fragmented, multipolar approach to decarbonization might actually fit it better.

Relying on a global institution struggling with governance, enforcement, and credibility might never have been a winning strategy.

A fragmented landscape of regional frameworks — from the EU’s ETS to whatever U.S., Asian, or Middle Eastern mechanisms emerge next — may actually prove more effective. Fragmentation allows nations to tailor policies to their own economic interests, move faster, and direct revenues toward local decarbonization rather than funneling billions into a centralized U.N. fund with limited oversight.

A decentralized, market-driven race to decarbonize — grounded in competition, instead of consensus — may be the most realistic solution in today’s geopolitical environment and, in turn, do more for the planet than a one-size-fits-all U.N. framework ever could hope to achieve.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_142906477.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:16:27.468622

Some participants are feeling relief while many were disappointed and pointed to the near-term uncertainties that everyone hoped would have been resolved.

The working group, however, is going ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework. They will be focusing on key issues related to greenhouse gas emissions as it works to develop consensus and clarifications on the architecture and implementation as well as the planned global fund. Further negotiations are expected on the carbon revenues as well as elements such as the use of biofuels and the supply of alternative fuels.

“The Framework’s success was always dependent on the development of strong and coherent implementation guidelines,” said Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at the influential NGO T&E (European Federation for Transport and Environment). “This work can continue regardless of the delay.”

Jan Hoffmann, the Global Lead for Maritime Transport and Ports at the World Bank wrote in a social media posting that the delays were “sad news” and “a sad day for multilateralism.” He warned that it “extends uncertainty for the maritime industry, leading to delays in investments in ports and shipping capacity, which will ultimately also mean higher and more volatile freight rates.”

Some parts, however, also expressed their frustration and anger at the members and the IMO. The Ambassador of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who is the Marshall Islands Special Envoy for Maritime Decarbonization, Albon Ishoda, wrote, “Don’t pretend that the Pacific was voiceless; we were ignored, bullied, threatened, cornered, sidelined and harassed…. A year delay is a year of more devastation and displacement for our communities that have nothing to do with this catastrophe. We don’t have the luxury of time. The IMO owe our people an explanation!”

The industry has begun to comprehend the delay while still standing behind the IMO. “Global regulation is essential to ensure a level playing field at international level and to deliver the energy transition of international shipping. We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure an agreement on the IMO NZF can be reached,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA).

The World Shipping Council also asserted that the IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. It wrote on Friday after the vote that it is committed to continuing to work with the government to deliver the necessary regulatory consistent for the industry.

The World Shipping Council is urging the IMO to use the time to close the remaining gaps in the agreement. INTERCARGO also reaffirmed its support for the IMO as the sole global regulator capable of delivering coherent and effective measures for international shipping. Similarly, the International Transport Workers’ Federation issue a statement calling for the governments to use the time to rebuild trust and reach agreement on a fair and practical path to decarbonizing shipping.

In times of geopolitical uncertainty, today’s decision could have sent a strong signal for global climate protection and multilateralism.
But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying.","It was supposed to be a final, and relatively easy, stage of the International Maritime Organisation’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) process to commit the global shipping industry to its Net Zero Framework. The hard battle had been fought in April at MEPC83, when the NZF and “mid term greenhouse gas reduction measures” were negotiated and agreed upon. But the steady ship began to list when the White House made a statement on Friday 10 October decrying unfair “burdens” on shipping and the “American people”. It described the NZF as an “unsanctioned global tax regime,” despite the UN body’s membership passing the measures via its usual process.

The EU issued a statement following the White House’s intervention, which reiterated the bloc’s support for the deal and suggested it should be adopted, and the IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez called for continued good-faith diplomacy and said the “process has been inclusive and thorough.”

As the week progressed, some reports from the IMO’s London Headquarters suggested on one hand that despite some opposition, with the US now joined by Russia and Saudi Arabia, the majority support meant spirits were high and compromise, and NZF adoption, was the likely outcome. Other reports gave a more mixed picture, and suggested the adoption of the agreed Framework would not be straightforward at all.

But on the final day the Extraordinary Session came down to a vote proposed by the Saudi delegation to adjourn the meeting for a full year. The vote passed, and delegates will “continue to work towards consensus on the IMO Net Zero Framework” in 12 months time. However, the IMO said its “Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet 20 to 24 October 2025, will go ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework.”

57 delegations voted for the year-long adjournment, 49 voted to oppose it, and 21 abstained.

IMO Members and stakeholder reactions

The response from many actors in the global shipping industry has been negative, but due to the political nature of the IMO and its discussions, very few shipping lines or vessel owners have publicly stated their views on the delay.

The IMO’s Dominguez was clearly unhappy with the highly politicised debate, and said “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

Thomas A. Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General, made clear that what the sector needed was clarity on future regulations and therefore the delay would not help the wider shipping industry.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,” he said.

Kostas Gkonis, Secretary General of INTERCARGO shared one of the more positive reactions, saying the delay was “an opportunity for further dialogue” and restating the association of dry bulk ship owners’ commitment to the IMO. This was a heavy hint that INTERCARGO does not want to see the fracturing of regional regulations that some are worried may follow the adjournment.

“Following IMO’s decision regarding the Net Zero Framework, INTERCARGO reaffirms its support to the IMO as the sole global regulator capable of delivering coherent and effective measures for international shipping. We wish to see the current postponement as an opportunity for further dialogue. The time ahead should be used constructively and effectively to bridge differing positions among IMO Member States and to also ensure that the industry’s voice and input are heard and taken onboard.

“We invite Member States at IMO to work more closely among them but also in partnership with the shipping community towards agreeing on a regulatory framework that is realistic, practical, and globally workable,” Gkonis concluded.

One of the firms that has shared a view on the collapse of the Extraordinary Session was OceanScore, which has delveoped a suite of tools to help shipping operators comply with emissions regulatuons like FuelEU.

In OceanScore’s view the vote to delay the NZF adoption “marks a turning point for shipping.”

“The vote wasn’t just procedural; it undermines the MEPC’s role and multilateral climate action as a whole. A one-year delay won’t change the political blockers.

With no clear global path forward, rules are now moving in different directions. Planning fuel, engine, and efficiency investments just became riskier and more expensive.”

“Regional rules will surge: the UK may extend its ETS to international voyages, and others could follow. With FuelEU Maritime now locked in, shipowners must hard-wire C/P and SHIPMAN clauses — waiting time is up,” it added.

Unsurprisingly, the most vocal group reacting to the delay have been companies engaged in cutting shipping emissions, and environmental groups.

Smart Green Shipping’s CEO Diane Gilpin said it was no surprise, and the lack of a centralised plan to cut the industry’s carbon output is a continunation, not a change. “While the decision by the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO MEPC83) to postpone adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework by one year is disappointing it’s not surprising. There’s never been a sensible global emissions policy that helps the industry transition to sustainable practices,” she said.

Others, including Delaine McCullough, Ocean Conservancy’s shipping program director, had stronger criticisms for delegates.

“The failure of IMO member states to clinch this agreement is a major setback for people and the planet. It’s disgraceful that climate action has been delayed when we see the devastating impacts every day, and when shipping fuels have been tied to 250,000 premature deaths and 6 million cases of childhood asthma every year.

“The agreement would have required ships across the globe to slash their greenhouse gas emissions, driving a sector-wide switch from dirty fossil fuels to zero-emission options, including harnessing the power of wind to traverse the ocean and running on new fuels produced from 100% renewable energy. The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives. A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.”

However, McCullough pointed to future IMO actions that could assist climate efforts. “While the agreement was not perfect, it was an important step to deliver on the IMO’s commitment and send clear signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal. While this delay is a serious setback, there is still a major opportunity to put the sector on a zero-emission pathway. In April 2026, the IMO will continue the revision of its main energy efficiency measure, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which would reduce fuel burn through technical and operational measures like simply slowing ships down. Strengthening the CII is absolutely critical to immediate emission reductions, necessary to meet the IMO’s 2030 goals.”

Lukas Leppert of German-based The Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), a Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM) partner, highlighted the economic losses from the delay alongside the environmental price.

“The outcome of today is disappointing. The international community has a clear obligation to protect the climate in shipping. In times of geopolitical uncertainty, today’s decision could have sent a strong signal for global climate protection and multilateralism. Instead, delays and obstacles have jeopardized more than a decade of negotiations.

“A package of measures to gradually replace fossil fuels and technologies, like LNG, and to relieve the burden on the climate and the environment was on the table. The path of delaying will lead to significantly higher economic costs and climate damages that will extend far beyond the shipping sector and into future generations.”

European presure group Transport & Environment accused the US of “bullying” over climate action, and lauded the European Union for continuing its efforts.

Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying. The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

T&E’s general statement added: “Crucially, the EU must continue to strengthen its own green shipping ambitions and retain its own maritime policies which now stand as the only substantive regulations to tackle shipping emissions in the void left by the IMO NZF. Bold regional action is still possible with or without the US.”

Finally, in a statement on LinkedIn, Secretary General of Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association Madadh MacLaine hoped that compromise would win out, in spite of “divisive actions”.

“MEPC ES2 adjourned abruptly after a vote called by Saudi Arabia, who continually referred to the IMO as a ‘House Divided’. For us who have been participating in the process since pre GHG Strategy, this house was only divided by the divisive actions of one bad actor (not named here) giving power to the latent negativity that we have overcome through delicate negotiations for years,” she said.

This delay, while creating additional uncertainty, warrant careful examination of the proposed mechanisms. Prior to the IMO MEPC meeting, in-depth research by Rystad Energy 's maritime decarbonization specialists revealed critical gaps in the current NZF that would to be addressed to ensure an equitable and sustainable transition for the global shipping industry. The delay will now give member states time to refine ambiguous or contentious elements to produce a stronger, more implementable framework.

The research revealed a substantial disparity between projected clean-fuel availability and targeted demand, exacerbated by infrastructure constraints, which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline. Furthermore, the study exposed a persistent imbalance in the carbon-trading mechanism, with demand for Tier II remedial unit offsets expected to outstrip available surplus units through 2035. This structural deficit is anticipated to drive trading prices towards the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The research also underscores the need for careful consideration in designing the reward mechanism to prevent it from becoming a mere penalty-collection system. While the cost gap is expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale are achieved, a well-designed reward mechanism is crucial to incentivize sustainable practices. By addressing these critical issues, the IMO can develop a more effective and equitable NZF, ultimately supporting the global shipping industry's transition to a low-carbon future.

Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Our findings suggests progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.

For more on the future of green shipping, listen to the recent Let’s Talk Energy episode: Shipping has a plan to go green, but will it work?

Rystad Energy recently published a detailed investigation into the NZF and its financial implications for the shipping industry's decarbonization journey. Download the report here.

The analysis leveraged our extensive cross-sector data assets, from conventional fuels to hydrogen derivatives and biofuels, alongside a comprehensive analysis of alternative-fuel fleet composition, port infrastructure and global shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet the direct target may generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels will generate Remedial Units (RUs). Remedial Units are categorized in two tiers: Tier I (RU1s) for vessels that meet the base target, and Tier II (RU2s) for those that do not.

Non-compliant vessels may offset their Tier II Remedial Units by acquiring Surplus Units from compliant vessels.

Key findings from Rystad Energy’s research reveal a complex interplay between SUs and RUs within the framework. Initial projections show SUs starting at 40 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2028, growing to 53 million tonnes by 2035. Simultaneously, RU2s are expected to increase significantly from 47 million tonnes to 234 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2035. The availability ratio between the SUs and RU2s will effectively set the market-clearing price for exchanges, with Rystad Energy’s projections suggesting that demand for RU2 offsets will consistently outstrip SU supply until 2035. This supply-demand imbalance will likely drive SU trading prices close to the Tier II penalty threshold.

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums. Given the limited availability of advanced biofuels for shipping, we anticipate that SU prices will approach the Tier II penalty level of $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, minus transaction costs.

While surplus units will substantially offset Tier II penalties through 2030, this mechanism could inadvertently limit the financial incentives available for early adopters of zero-emission technologies. The real turning point comes in 2031, when surplus units become increasingly scarce, compliance requirements tighten, and shipping companies face growing emission deficits. This will trigger a sharp escalation in penalty collections, substantially boosting the Net-Zero Fund's capacity to support the industry's decarbonization efforts.

The research highlights potential challenges in the framework's design, particularly the two-year limit on banking surplus units to avoid dilution of future emission-reduction efforts, which could potentially dampen early adoption of clean technologies. This constraint stands in stark contrast to the FuelEU Maritime regulation's permanent banking allowance.

Financial projections indicate substantial growth in the IMO Net-Zero Fund, with combined Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate approximately $13 billion in 2028, escalating to nearly $79 billion by 2035. However, our analysis raises concerns about the framework's effectiveness in supporting the transition to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its early years.

Rystad Energy's analysis estimates the potential reward level and benchmarks it against the required reward level, which is the threshold necessary to equalize the effective costs of e-fuels and conventional fuel oil. Initially, the required reward level is substantial due to the significant cost premium associated with e-fuels, resulting in a shortfall in cost compensation from the net-zero fund until 2030, even if 100% of the fund's resources are allocated to rewards. However, as technological advancements drive cost reductions, learning effects take hold, and economies of scale are achieved, the required reward level is expected to decrease over time, ultimately yielding a substantial surplus in the fund after the required reward.

Our findings suggest that even with 100% fund allocation toward rewards, the mechanism may not adequately compensate for the cost premium of zero or near-zero emission fuels (ZNZs) until 2030. However, beyond 2030, a substantial surplus is expected to emerge in the fund, driven by the initially low uptake of ZNZs. This underscores the critical importance of carefully designing the reward mechanism to ensure it effectively catalyzes the industry's transition toward zero-emission shipping. The fund should be used to drive meaningful emissions reductions, rather than accumulating a large surplus.

—

If an environmental economist stumbled upon a magic lamp and got one wish from the genie, most of us would know what to ask for—a harmonized global price on greenhouse gas emissions pegged to the social cost of carbon. Economists are usually told that such a carbon price is magical thinking, that it can never be adopted in the real world.

So I was fascinated and heartened when the International Maritime Organization voted in April to put a global price on carbon in the shipping industry. The IMO is a UN agency that governs global shipping, including provisions covering safety and the environment, through a treaty process. In 2023, the IMO adopted a framework for global shipping that had a 2050 net zero target. The vote in April, which occurred only after the US stormed out of the meetings, approved a substantial emissions fee as a mechanism for achieving these goals, with the revenue used both to help shippers decarbonize and to help the most vulnerable island nations adapt. Standard IMO procedure mandates a waiting period before finalization, which brought the April action back to the IMO’s meetings last week in London.

The April decision was a landmark. Shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions—about the same as Germany. The April policy called for substantial fees that would create a binding price across the globe, covering vessels over a certain size, which constitute 85% of shipping. The policy had broad support internationally (including the EU27, China, Brazil, the UK, Canada, Korea and Japan) and from industry—shippers themselves were asking for regulatory guidance before investing in the next generation of vessels.

In broad strokes, this sounds like the economist’s dream come true. Upon closer inspection, however, the policy isn’t quite a carbon tax—it’s a novel chimera composed of an intensity standard, an emissions tax, a tradable permit system, and a subsidy. Mixed together, this policy cocktail might turn out fine, but the unusual design carries likely inefficiencies and a few points of real risk. Let’s call the economics a work in progress.

And then, last week, the initiative ran aground. Last week’s vote was initially viewed as a formality likely to confirm the prior decision, despite a concerted effort from Saudi Arabia and a few others to drum up opposition. But then the Trump administration weighed in forcefully against the initiative, threatening tariffs on member states and implying they would sanction individual delegates who voted in favor. In the end, the IMO buckled under this pressure and delayed the vote by one year. Whether it has a chance of passing later remains to be seen. Let’s call the politics a work in progress as well.

How Would the Policy Work?

—

Each year, ships calculate their GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI)—grams of CO₂-equivalent per megajoule of energy consumed, measured on a lifecycle basis. This intensity gets compared against two thresholds that tighten over time: a Direct Compliance Target and a less stringent (higher emissions) Base Target. I’ll call these Ambition and Baseline.

Source: IMO

Your position relative to these thresholds determines your obligations.

Start with the middle (yellow zone), the easiest case. If your emissions rate falls between Baseline and Ambition, you owe $100 per ton of CO₂e for emissions above Ambition. The only way to satisfy this obligation is buying non-tradable Tier 1 Remedial Units directly from the IMO. You cannot buy credits from cleaner ships. This functions as a straight carbon tax at $100 per ton.

If your emissions exceed Baseline (red zone), things get more expensive. You still owe the $100 tax on emissions between Ambition and Baseline, but for emissions above Baseline, you face a steeper penalty. You can either buy Tier 2 Remedial Units from the IMO for $380 per ton, or—if available—buy excess compliance credits from vessels clean enough to operate in the green zone (below Ambition).

Vessels in the green zone owe nothing but stand to gain in two ways. First, for every ton of CO₂e below Ambition, they generate tradable excess credits that can be sold to red zone vessels. Second, they’re eligible for additional rewards from a fund financed by the policy revenues—a subsidy for early adopters on top of the credit market value.

The Hybrid Donut: Three Scenarios, Three Problems

—

Think about the economic incentives this creates. For green and red zone vessels, we have a cap-and-trade system with a price ceiling of $380 and a price floor of $0. But the middle yellow zone sits outside this trading system, facing a mandatory $100 payment.

This creates what I’m calling a “hybrid donut”—three distinct economic regimes with discontinuous marginal incentives. I can’t think of another policy that looks like this, and for good reason. The odd design creates perverse outcomes that depend on whether tradable credits are scarce or abundant.

Scenario 1: Credits are scarce (price hits $380 ceiling)

If the Ambition benchmark proves tough to achieve—which seems likely given the high cost of complete fuel switching—excess credits will be scarce and trade at the $380 ceiling. In this case, we’ve created a marginal emissions price (opportunity cost) of $380 for clean vessels, $100 for vessels in the middle, then $380 again for the dirtiest ships.

The great virtue of carbon pricing is that it “harvests the low hanging fruit” among abatement opportunities by ensuring every participant faces the same marginal incentive to reduce emissions. Creating two different tiers with vastly different prices erodes that efficiency—vessels in the yellow zone stop abating when the cost per ton reaches $100, but vessels in the other zones keep going until costs are nearly four times higher. This gives them, for example, wildly different incentives to adjust speed or manage routes to reduce emissions.

—

Activity in the red and green zone operates through a tradable permit system, where prices could be high or low, while the yellow zone is a clean tax.

—

Scenario 2: Credits are abundant (price falls to $0 floor)

This is where things get genuinely perverse. If a substantial number of vessels switch to clean ammonia or methanol, excess credits could flood the market and trade near zero. Now consider a vessel operating in the red zone, well above Baseline. It still owes the $100 tax on emissions between Ambition and Baseline. But for emissions above Baseline, it can buy unlimited free credits.

Here’s the problem: if you’re a dirty vessel not contemplating a complete overhaul to get down into the yellow zone, you face zero marginal incentive to reduce emissions to get down to Baseline. Any incremental improvements—better operations, modest efficiency gains—deliver no cost savings because credits are free. The only action that matters is the big one: getting all the way down below Baseline.

This system risks creating a bifurcated market. If success means getting new methanol or ammonia vessels into the green zone, that very success eliminates incentives for the old conventional fleet to gradually improve or even to retire. The more green vessels we have, the cheaper credits become, and the less reason dirty vessels have to clean up or get scrapped. Success breeds failure—progress in one part of the fleet locks in emissions from the worst performers.

Scenario 3: Credits trade between $0 and $380

This gives us a muted version of Scenario 1 or 2, depending where prices settle. We get the same inefficiencies as one of the other two cases, but the price gap is smaller. I won’t pretend to know whether permits will be abundant or scarce, but many cap-and-trade programs have ended up trading at their floor or ceiling.

No economist would design such a system intentionally. Instead, this appears to reflect competing demands that got mashed together rather than reconciled. Some parties wanted an aggressive price signal (the $380 tier). Others demanded guaranteed revenue for island nation aid and subsidies to early adopters (the non-tradable $100 middle band). Still others insisted on compliance flexibility through trading (the cap-and-trade system for green and red zones). Rather than choose among these priorities, the solution was to accommodate all three simultaneously, which produced a policy Frankenstein.

The Performance Standard Problem

—

There’s a second design choice that troubles me: this policy is based on a performance standard (gCO₂eq/MJ) rather than an absolute emissions standard (total gCO₂eq). That distinction matters because economic theory shows a performance standard is equivalent to a tax on emissions (good) plus a subsidy to baseline activity—here, megajoules of energy use (bad).

A performance standard incentivizes cleaner fuels without limiting industry growth—good for politics, but it inadvertently erodes incentives to reduce energy consumption through efficiency measures.

This seems particularly problematic given the IMO’s previous successes with efficiency standards. Research has shown that operational changes—slow steaming, route optimization, hull design improvements—can deliver 10-30% emissions reductions. But under this policy, in Scenario 1 where credits trade at $380, clean vessels could actually maximize credit generation by running longer, farther, and less efficiently to inflate their total MJ consumed while maintaining low gCO₂eq/MJ intensity.

A ship using clean ammonia that takes an unnecessarily long route generates more credits than an identical ship that optimizes for efficiency. That’s backwards.

Conclusion

—

The IMO meeting in London this week proved that even when carbon pricing initially clears a high bar of international consensus with industry support, it can still fail. The world’s biggest fossil fuel producers, led by the US, successfully delayed a policy that would have created the world’s first mandatory sectoral carbon price. The initiative’s future is murky.

What lesson should we draw from this experience? Does this demonstrate that robust carbon pricing is politically impossible? Would some other policy structure that wasn’t a carbon price have managed to pass?

I’m reluctant to embrace the doomer view. Sixty-three countries (initially) voted for this measure. The shipping industry supported it. Island nations backed it. Major economies embraced it. The policy failed to be enacted not because carbon pricing is unworkable, but because one major power, in an exceptional political moment, deployed its leverage to stall something that would have otherwise succeeded.

The fact that it took a historically hostile US administration to prevent a robust sectoral carbon price from being adopted suggests the foundation for carbon pricing is stronger than some pessimists claim. So I’ll keep my glass one-quarter full. There is much room for improvement in the policy, so my hope is that the IMO finds some space to improve the underlying economics, even while it focuses on finding a way to navigate the choppy political waters.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted on October 17 to postpone by one year negotiations on the Net-Zero Framework, a proposed regulation designed to price greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine fuels. Out of 127 countries present, 57 supported the motion to adjourn, led by Saudi Arabia, while 49 opposed and 21 abstained. The adjournment required a simple majority of 54 votes.

The Net-Zero Framework, approved last April by 63 votes to 16, aimed to introduce a pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2028. Its objective was to provide a clear market signal to encourage investment in low-carbon marine fuels. The newly approved delay casts doubt on both the implementation timeline and the integrity of the current text, which may need substantial revisions.

Deep divisions among member states

The adjournment motion was driven by a group of fossil fuel-producing countries, including Venezuela, Russia, and lead proponent Saudi Arabia. Additional support came from India, Panama, and other nations that had previously endorsed the framework in April. In contrast, several European countries, Pacific island nations, and Brazil voiced clear opposition to the delay.

A Brazilian delegate warned that the postponement could amount to a de facto rejection, citing the difficulty in preserving key elements of the current text. Japan, Cyprus, and Greece—previous supporters—abstained from the vote, suggesting waning backing for the framework.

Diplomatic pressure and geopolitical tensions

The United States applied considerable diplomatic pressure in the lead-up to the vote. On October 16, President Donald Trump called the framework a “global carbon tax” and declared it unacceptable for the U.S. maritime industry. A joint statement from three U.S. cabinet secretaries threatened retaliatory measures such as increased port fees, sanctions, and restrictions on port and terminal access if the framework were adopted.

Some U.S.-based industry groups, including the Renewable Fuels Association, had expressed support for the regulation due to its market potential for renewable fuels. Following the delay, these groups stated they would continue lobbying in favour of the measure.

Bunker markets face continued regulatory uncertainty

The delay adds further uncertainty to shipowners’ fuel investment decisions. In Singapore, average delivered prices last month stood at $483.73/metric ton for 0.5% sulphur fuel oil, compared with $579.17 for liquefied natural gas (LNG), $691.92 for B24 biobunker fuel, and $1,897.44 for 100% sustainable methanol.

Several maritime organisations reiterated the industry’s need for regulatory clarity. The Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping stated that “the industry needs certainty to unlock the required investments.”

Technical talks to continue

Despite the official adjournment, IMO member states will continue technical discussions on the Net-Zero Framework from October 20 to 24 during the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG from Ships. The IMO Secretary-General said he intends to maintain cooperation among states but acknowledged that “geopolitics currently make it difficult to resolve certain issues.”

The European Commission affirmed its commitment to participate constructively in upcoming talks, while some observers expressed growing doubt about the framework’s future viability.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/en_1140190947540-1.webp,N,,2025-10-20 14:00:43.734451

After a week of climate negotiations in London, IMO member states opted to delay voting on the framework, which aims to establish the world’s first global carbon pricing mechanism for any industrial sector. The NZF is designed to chart a clear course toward net-zero emissions in international shipping and ensure a level playing field through coordinated global regulation.

For many across the maritime industry, the postponement introduces renewed uncertainty at a critical time. The NZF has been widely regarded as a cornerstone in aligning shipping with global climate goals, setting incentives for cleaner fuels and low-carbon operations.

“We regret today’s postponement of the adoption of the international climate agreement for shipping,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA). “The IMO Net-Zero Framework is essential to give the industry the certainty it needs and to send a strong signal to the market to produce the clean fuels necessary to get to net zero.”

Raptis emphasized that shipping, as a global industry, depends on international rules to decarbonize effectively. Fragmented national or regional policies, he noted, could distort competition and slow down investment in sustainable energy solutions. “Global regulation is essential to ensure a level playing field at international level and to deliver the energy transition of international shipping,” he added.

The delay comes amid growing calls from industry leaders and environmental groups for clear, binding measures to cut emissions from the maritime sector, which carries around 90% of world trade. Many shipowners had hoped the IMO would finalize the framework this year to maintain momentum and give investors confidence in future regulatory stability.

Despite the setback, Raptis confirmed ECSA’s commitment to international cooperation, stating that the organization “will continue to work with our international partners to ensure an agreement on the IMO NZF can be reached.”",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-apple-touch-icon-32x32-optimized.png,N,,2025-10-20 12:56:14.694367

Shanghai, China (20 October 2025) – The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reaches a new milestone today.

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

Today, the corridor partners will present their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025. The report spotlights the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

2025 Milestones: achievements

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 tons of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realized China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Carriers Working Group

Carriers began deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels in 2022 and continue to prepare fleets for a zero-emission future. In 2024, the first green methanol container ship completed its voyage on the corridor.

Prepared deployment plans for vessels with low-carbon emission capability for each shipping company to create a transparent roadmap.

Energy Supply Working Group

Reviewed fuel standards for 2026 adoption, including requirements for fuels’ GHG intensity.

Finalized study on fuel demand and supply for the corridor.

Tracked developments at IMO, the EU, and other organizations and regions on both fuel standards and regulations.

Metrics and Evaluation Working Group

Developed a phased approach to metrics for the corridor:

Phase 1 – develop ship-based and port-based GSC goal-related deployment metrics.

Phase 2 – develop ship-based and port-based GSC activity-based metrics.

Phase 3 – develop one or more indicative emission reduction metric(s).

Next steps for the corridor

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.
To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework.
“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch, “the science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions.
UCO and palm derivatives, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), have been associated with fraud, weak auditing and risk displacement from their current use, increasing the use of unsustainable palm oil elsewhere.","Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia and Global Forest Coalition are calling the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to exclude harmful biofuels from compliance with the Net-Zero Framework. Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026. But important discussions will continue on 20–24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organizations stress the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia. “The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

The example of Indonesia should be a warning to other countries. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations for biofuel continues to drive deforestation – even within protected and conservation forests which are highly vulnerable to climate change. “The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch, “the science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

Recent research estimates that while used cooking oil (UCO) will be the cheapest pathway for compliance, its supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuels production could only meet about 5% of shipping’s energy demand, leaving the sector reliant on the next-cheapest compliance pathway, high-ILUC biofuels, with major sustainability risks. UCO and palm derivatives, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), have been associated with fraud, weak auditing and risk displacement from their current use, increasing the use of unsustainable palm oil elsewhere.

The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Credits__Biofuelwatch.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:20:25.229129

The same oligarchy that sought to tax global trade will be back next year.","In 2018, the IMO adopted its initial greenhouse gas emissions strategy, a regulatory effort that eventually became a draft “Net-Zero Framework” that was set to be approved by IMO voting members on Friday.

THE DAWN OF TRUMP’S NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE

If adopted, the Net-Zero Framework would charge vessels of more than 5,000 gross tons between $100 and $380 for every ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, depending on how badly each vessel overshot an emissions target set by the IMO. The stated goal is to end the use of oil in shipping, reducing the sector’s net emissions to zero by 2050.

Global shipping is responsible for just 2% of all greenhouse gas emissions each year, meaning that eliminating all its emissions would have virtually no impact on global climate or temperatures. But the impact of the first global carbon tax would be at least $10 billion a year. That is what proponents, not critics, say. U.N. bureaucrats would then waste the $10 billion on whatever corrupt kickbacks struck their fancy.

While the United States is both a member of the IMO and a signatory to MARPOL Annex VI, nothing in the Net-Zero Framework specifies what would happen to countries that ignore the agreement. Only about 1% of all cargo ships are owned by the U.S., and the flag state of each vessel, the nation where it is registered, would be authorized to collect the tax. The Net-Zero Framework also empowers inspectors to assess the carbon tax at any port a vessel stops at to offload or load cargo.

The Trump administration has always opposed any international environmental agreement that harms our national interests. Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced strict measures they would take against any country that voted to approve the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework. These include visa restrictions, commercial penalties from contracts with the federal government, port fees, and increased tariffs.

A BAD DAY FOR RACIAL GERRYMANDERING AT THE SUPREME COURT

This worked, with Singapore and Saudi Arabia leading the effort to delay a final vote on the framework for at least a year. In total, 57 countries, including the U.S., voted in favor of delaying the measure, 49 voted against, and 21 abstained. The IMO needs two-thirds of the votes to approve the framework before it can become legally binding.

Trump’s success at blocking the carbon tax is a victory for common sense and American sovereignty. For decades, global bureaucrats have used climate policy as a pretext to siphon billions of dollars from productive nations into corrupt international schemes that punish workers and consumers. By standing up to the IMO’s climate crusade, Trump defended affordable energy, economic growth, and national independence. But this fight isn’t over. The same oligarchy that sought to tax global trade will be back next year. America must remain vigilant and continue leading the world away from destructive globalism and toward true energy freedom.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25218709041842_e82090.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-20 12:56:22.470875

The meeting organised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) received special attention this year as they debated a legally binding net-zero framework.

The measure would have required all large ships – including cruise ships – to slash emissions 17 per cent by 2028. Led by pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia, however, world leaders postponed a vote on it until the next meeting in 2026.

If adopted, the earliest the measure could go into force will now be March 2028.

While the delay was met with cheers in the US, environmental advocates across the world slammed the inaction. The decision effectively stalls what could have been the world’s first global, legally binding carbon-cutting plan for the shipping sector – one of the planet’s biggest and fastest-growing sources of emissions.

What was at stake?

The resolution, known as the Net-Zero Framework, was the IMO’s most ambitious attempt yet to make the shipping industry accountable for its carbon footprint.

The framework would have introduced a global fuel standard and a carbon pricing system, forcing companies to slash emissions or pay a fee.

Shipping currently accounts for around 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, or about one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the IMO and Climate Watch Data.

Many large ships, including some cruise ships at sea and vessels that transit the Arctic, run on heavy fuel oil. Considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels, they emit black carbon, methane and sulphur oxides that harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

Had it passed, the framework could have made shipping the first sector in the world to adopt a legally binding, global carbon price, and potentially eliminated up to one billion metric tons of carbon annually by 2050, according to the Ocean Conservancy.

Delaine McCullough, shipping program director at Ocean Conservancy, calls the failure to come to an agreement “a major setback for people and the planet.”

“The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives,” says McCullough. “A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.”

How it unravelled over four days

The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), the IMO body responsible for the decision, remained divided throughout four days of tense negotiations.

On the final day, 57 member states voted to adjourn for a year, while 49 voted to continue, effectively stalling progress for now.

Behind the scenes, the US reportedly led an aggressive campaign to block the vote.

President Donald Trump branded the proposal a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” warning that the US “would not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.”

His Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the outcome “a huge win” for the White House, claiming it protected consumers from a “massive UN tax hike.”

The US was joined by Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil-producing states in “delay tactics,” according to environmental group Seas at Risk and others.

The rhetoric mirrored the divisions seen at COP29, which went into overtime to avoid a similar collapse due to a lack of consensus. But while COP negotiators managed to strike a deal on climate finance before the conference ended, the IMO talks ended in stalemate.

“Emotions have run high this week, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason,” said Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas at Risk.

“Few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are. The planet and the future of shipping do not have time to waste.”

What does the delay mean for the planet?

Using IMO data, the International Council of Clean Transportation predicts shipping could account for as much as 17 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Experts say the delay makes it harder for the industry to meet its own 2030 and 2050 climate goals. Each year of inaction not only affects carbon taxes, it also risks locking in polluting infrastructure for decades, as ship lifespans often exceed 25 years.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum.

“The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging.”

While environmental groups called the decision “a disgrace,” the IMO’s secretary general, Arsenio Dominguez, urged patience, saying the body would reconvene in October 2026 to continue talks.

Even if business as usual prevails, critics say there is hope for change on the horizon.

“While this delay is a serious setback, there is still a major opportunity to put the sector on a zero-emission pathway,” McCullough notes.

In April, the IMO will continue to revise the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), its measure of operational efficiency, she explains. The organisation aims to make the CII more stringent to align with its goal of reducing emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

“Strengthening the CII is absolutely critical to immediate emission reductions,” she says, “[and] necessary to meet the IMO’s 2030 goals.”",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/51/93/93/1200x675_cmsv2_f818c369-02f4-5d89-bd74-8c47a41833d3-9519393.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:20:28.851233

A four-day thriller of political back-and-forth, public warnings and backroom negotiations preceded the IMO meeting in London, which was aimed at approving or rejecting a new NZF. However, the US and several other countries strongly opposed it. The vote was initially postponed from day to day and then, on Friday, the last day of the session, from hour to hour. It was finally decided to postpone the vote for another year.

Sources say the Greek delegation had been instructed to abstain if the vote was eventually held, a decision interpreted as maintaining equal distances between the EU and the US.

A day earlier, on Thursday, the US president had said on social media that he was “outraged” by the initiative and would not support a “global green new shipping fraud tax… in any way.” “Stand with the US and vote NO in London,” he wrote on Truth Social.

The NZF is a new regulatory system proposed for global shipping to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It establishes a legally binding global framework with a mandatory greenhouse gas fuel intensity standard and a pricing mechanism: Ships exceeding certain emission limits would pay a fine, while those with the best performance would earn credits to trade. However, it remains unclear exactly how these funds would be managed.

Friday’s unprecedented vote represents a severe setback for multilateral climate action. It is difficult to see how a one-year delay will change the deeply rooted opposition from states such as the US or Saudi Arabia.

This is bad news for the net-zero transition — and bad news for shipping. The regulatory trajectory is now uncertain, and the policy landscape risks becoming fragmented, creating a more complex and therefore more expensive environment for investment decisions on fuels, engines, and energy-saving technologies.

What to expect next:

Stronger push for regional regulation. Pressure will increase to expand and enforce local/regional schemes. The UK has already signalled plans to extend its ETS (due July 2026) to cover voyages to and from the UK if the IMO framework fails. Others like Turkey, the African Union, China, etc. are likely to explore copycat schemes modelled after the EU ETS. This will not only drive up costs but will massively increase compliance complexity.

EU ETS expansion becomes more likely. The inclusion of vessels below 5,000 GT in the EU ETS, currently scheduled for 2027, now looks more probable. Any softening or alignment of FuelEU Maritime with global regulation is unlikely — the IMO NZF will not materialise, and FuelEU Maritime is here to stay. Get your contractual clauses agreed and signed.

Pooling stays alive under FuelEU. Under the original NZF plan, commercial pooling would have been effectively eliminated by 2028. With NZF off the table, pooling will remain — and strategies must adjust accordingly.

Biofuels and e-fuels outlook shifts. Their case is now weakened and largely confined to European trading for the foreseeable future. In the short term, this may ease supply constraints — but long term, it risks slowing the essential build-up of production capacity and infrastructure.

Shipping has long been a global regulatory success story — one of the very few industries capable of agreeing and implementing uniform rules at global scale, not just on environmental issues. This is a remarkable achievement. Let us hope that last week’s MEPC failure does not mark the start of a new era of fragmented, overlapping, and conflicting regional regulation.

The framework incentivises ships – regardless of their flag – to adopt cleaner technologies and fuels, while those using high-intensity fuels would face charges based on the greenhouse gases they emit.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO greenhouse gas strategy.”

The US has pushed back against the NZF since April, with President Trump calling the initiative a “green scam” on his Truth Social platform.

Before the meeting the US set out actions it would impose on countries in favour of the framework, including port fees and commercial penalties on ships.

A spokesperson from the US Department of State, said: “The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

Alice Larkin, professor of climate science and energy policy at the University of Manchester, said: “With a global carbon budget associated with a 50:50 chance of avoiding 1.5C of warming set to be exhausted in less than three years, it is clear how significant and disastrous a one-year delay in any mitigation effort is for people and the planet.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/23029/shipping.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-10-20 11:20:37.892480

The Daily Telegraph reports separate analysis, commissioned by shadow minister Nick Timothy, which it says shows “up to 15%” of cuts were due to offshoring.
The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, another Daily Telegraph article and the i newspaper all cover the Miliband interview and possible changes to bills.
The Daily Telegraph reports claims that an extra 1.1bn barrels of oil has been “found in the North Sea”.
[See the Carbon Brief factcheck on why expensive gas – not net-zero – has been keeping bills high.]","Member countries of the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) have agreed to wait a year before deciding on whether to formally adopt a global carbon price for shipping, the National reports, adding that “negotiations collapsed under US pressure”. It says the IMO had been due to finalise a deal, agreed in April, that would have “made shipping the first global industry subject to a carbon pricing system”. The Financial Times describes the “eleventh-hour” delay as a “major victory” for “Donald Trump’s campaign to block a climate agreement for the global shipping industry” and “part of the wider Trump administration drive to sell more of its oil, coal and gas”. It says that before last week’s talks, the US had “warned that countries that backed the measure could face their vessels being blocked, visa restrictions and commercial penalties”. The newspaper adds: “The move [to postpone the decision for a year] was likely to spell the death of the agreement, some observers said, despite previous support for the deal from the EU, UK, India, China and Brazil.”

The Associated Press says “nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus” on the deal. It adds: “Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to [COP30 in] Belém and beyond is now more difficult.” The New York Times says the US succeeded in securing a delay after using a “battering ram of trade and visa threats”, in an effort that was supported by Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Washington Post says the delay came after “threats” from Trump. Separate articles from Agence France-Presse report the UN calling the delay a “missed opportunity”, the European Commission saying it was “regrettable” and US secretary of state Marco Rubio describing it as a “huge win”. Reuters reports: “Danish shipping company Maersk said the IMO’s decision was a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonise.”

Climate Home News notes that the IMO’s “net-zero framework” had been due to set emissions reduction targets for ships starting in 2028, adding that this timeline has been “plunged into doubt”. [See the Carbon Brief Q&A on the provisional deal for details.] BBC News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, Independent, Guardian, Bloomberg, Le Monde, Daily Telegraph and Politico also have the story. In related comment, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal welcomes the decision to delay the deal. It mischaracterises what was a vote by IMO member countries as a “UN agency…[that was] about to impose the first global carbon tax…blink[ing]”.

The UK government has launched a “national plan to train people for an extra 400,000 green jobs in the next five years”, double the current number, the Guardian reports. It continues: “The energy secretary [Ed Miliband] unveiled a scheme to double the number of people working in green industries by 2030, with a particular focus on training those coming from fossil fuel jobs, school leavers, the unemployed, veterans and ex-offenders.” The newspaper adds: “Miliband said the national plan ‘answers a key question about where the good jobs of the future will come from’…Miliband said the promise of hundreds of thousands of new roles in the renewables and clean-energy sector would show that Reform UK is ‘waging war on jobs’ by challenging the switch to net-zero.”

Reuters adds: “The government said that recent public and private investment in clean energy, such as renewables and nuclear, was driving a surge in demand for industrial workers, with plumbers, electricians, and welders especially sought after. Under the new plans, five new colleges will train young people for clean-energy careers, while a national programme will help connect workers with jobs in solar installation, wind turbine manufacturing, and nuclear power.” The Daily Mirror reports: “Miliband says Tory and Reform net-zero critics are ‘anti-worker’ as he unveils green jobs bonanza.” The Press Association, BusinessGreen, BBC News and Daily Express all cover the story. The Sun buries its coverage under a headline about migration, while the Daily Telegraph leads with the line that Miliband has been “ridiculed [by Reform] over plans to rebrand plumbers, electricians and welders as ‘clean energy’ workers”. In related news, the Times reports on warnings that the government is losing support to the Greens.

MORE ON UK

The Times reports new figures from consultancy Oxera showing that only 5% of UK emissions reductions in recent decades have resulted from “offshoring”. The Daily Telegraph reports separate analysis, commissioned by shadow minister Nick Timothy, which it says shows “up to 15%” of cuts were due to offshoring.

BBC News reports that Scottish first minister John Swinney “has said that Scotland and its government has a ‘moral obligation’ to support countries facing severe effects of climate change”. Another BBC News piece asks if the Scottish government is “softening” in its opposition to oil and gas.

ReNews says the government has confirmed a “single timetable” for the AR7 renewable auction, with results due to be published on 14 January 2026.

BBC News reports on plans from Chinese firm Ming Yang to invest £1.5bn in a wind turbine factory in Scotland under the headline: “Friend or foe? The China challenge on the Moray Firth.” The Daily Mail says “ministers [have been] warned of security risk” over the plans, also covered by the Scotsman and the Daily Telegraph.

The Times says the government competition to select successful developers of small modular reactors has cost £22m.

The Daily Telegraph has a feature on UK plans for “colossal investment” in carbon capture and storage, which it presents under a headline claiming: “Miliband’s £22bn CO2 vision risks crashing into reality.”

Energy secretary Ed Miliband has “given the strongest hint yet” that the government might cut VAT from household energy bills at the budget in late November, the Financial Times reports. It says that Miliband, when asked directly about VAT on bills in an interview with the BBC, responded that the “whole of the government…understands that we face an affordability crisis in this country”. The newspaper adds: “Scrapping it would save a household with average usage about £86 a year, according to the charity Nesta, and cost the government about £2.5bn a year. Last month Nesta’s Marcus Shepheard questioned whether a VAT cut was the best way to lower energy bills.” BBC News also describes Miliband’s response as a “hint…at a cut to VAT”. It says that Miliband “told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme he stood by that promise [to lower bills by £300 by 2030], but [said] the reason bills were so high was ‘because of our dependence on fossil fuels’.” The broadcaster also reports Miliband saying the government was “look[ing] at” the levies on bills that fund climate and social policy, which could be funded through taxes instead.

The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, another Daily Telegraph article and the i newspaper all cover the Miliband interview and possible changes to bills. Separately, the Sun speculates on other changes that could be in the upcoming budget, including a “pay-per-mile road charge for electric vehicles”, a rise in fuel duty rates and a cut in VAT on public EV charging. Another Sun article says the chancellor is “looking at electric vehicle drivers paying their fair share of tax in a budget revenue-raiser” and points to ideas including “levies on the weight of the car or a pay-per-mile system”.

MORE ON MILIBAND

The Sun says opposition Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed that Miliband is “binding Britain to Beijing” and is attempting to tie the government’s climate plans to a collapsed and unrelated spying case.

The Independent reports that Conservative shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho “would not be drawn on when a Conservative government might aim to reach net-zero after her party pledged to scrap the 2050 target”. It quotes her telling the BBC that “decarbonisation is not a bad thing”, but that “we don’t have a target”.

The Daily Express says Miliband has “refused to rule out development of the Rosebank oil field”. The Daily Telegraph reports claims that an extra 1.1bn barrels of oil has been “found in the North Sea”.

The Daily Express personal finance editor Harvey Jones claims, in an article that is not labelled as comment, that Miliband is “out of control”.

For the Financial Times, global business columnist and associate editor Rana Foroohar says the US-China dispute over rare-earth elements is “hard to see…as anything other than shadow boxing”. She continues: “China’s export controls on the sector and ringfencing of critical minerals – which are needed for everything from semiconductors and electric vehicles to smartphones and fighter jets – is a big hit to the US.” Foroohar explains that China has “never made any secret of its desire” to dominate the industry, pointing out that “Deng Xiaoping announced the country’s desire to turn rare earths into the ‘oil’ of China” in 1992. She concludes: “[T]he Trump White House is doubling down on…pouring hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and loans into jump-starting critical mineral mining and production in the US. The only surprise in all of this is that it took so long. I predict both the shadow boxing – and the race to rebuild strategic sectors – will continue.”

An editorial in the Wall Street Journal says US treasury secretary Scott Bessent is “right” to “coordinate with allies to counter China’s weaponisation of rare-earth minerals”, but adds that this might have been easier if Trump was not “also hitting our allies with unprovoked unilateral tariffs”. For the Daily Telegraph, industry editor Matt Oliver writes that China “has a stranglehold over the key technologies other countries need to hit net-zero”.

MORE COMMENT

In a comment for the Daily Express, the Grantham Institute’s Bob Ward writes under the headline: “Climate change could make it dangerous for humans to go outside – we must act.”

An editorial in the Guardian says plug-in hybrid electric vehicles “pollute more than their manufacturers claim – and delay the real shift to electric and shared mobility”.

A comment for Bloomberg by BNEF analyst Colin McKerracher says European carmakers “ought to be careful what they wish for” on vehicle CO2 standards.

For Climate Home News, Sergio Diaz, legal director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, calls for countries to “confront fossil fuels head on” in their new climate pledges under the Paris Agreement.

The Wall Street Journal carries a comment calling for more focus on adapting to climate change, by Kalee Kreider, principal of consultancy the Kreider Group and Alex Flint, of the Alliance for Market Solutions.

In a comment for the Daily Express, UK energy secretary Ed Miliband writes that he is “determined that the clean-energy revolution being delivered by this government must deliver for the workers and communities that power it”. He continues: “That means providing new opportunities for decent jobs at fair wages to communities up and down our country. From building new nuclear in Somerset and Suffolk to carbon capture in the Humber.” Miliband says there “could be more than 800,000” clean-energy jobs by 2030 – double the current number – and that “veterans should be first on the list for these new opportunities”.

An editorial in the Sunday Mirror responds to the jobs plan and says: “Climate change sceptics are not just ignoring the damage it does but also failing to recognise the economic benefits net-zero will bring.” It adds: “Focusing on renewables and nuclear power is undeniably the future. If we do not lead the field in technology now we will suffer the cost of importing it later.” A contrasting editorial in the climate-sceptic Sun claims – without evidence – that the 400,000 planned new clean-energy jobs is “far fewer than the number of jobs [Miliband’s] policies are costing in other sectors”. The Daily Mirror carries a comment by Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC union welcomes the government’s “serious plan”, writing: “[T]his plan is about giving working people a future. It’s about making sure no community is left behind as we move to cleaner, greener energy.”

MORE UK COMMENT

In the Guardian, senior economics writer Philip Inman writes under the headline: “Ed Miliband needs a plan for industry – without it, the move to net-zero could ruin UK manufacturing.”

A new treatise on the UK called “prosperity through growth” is touted by its authors in the comment pages of the Times and the Daily Express. The authors – including long-standing opponents of climate action Matthew Elliott and Michael Hintze – call for “smart net-zero”, without explanation as to what this might mean.

The Sun gives space to climate-sceptic celebrity Jeremy Clarkson to criticise “Labour eco-loons”. The Daily Express deems his thoughts worthy of news coverage.

Daily Telegraph columnist Janet Daley rails against the “malignancy” of those protesting on “Vietnam, climate change, Gaza”.

For the Sunday Times, Martin Pibworth, chief executive of energy firm SSE writes: “Investing for a net-zero future isn’t responsible for rising prices. Instead, upgrades to home-grown electricity will improve energy security and cut costs.” Pushing back on recent arguments, he adds that expected reductions in wholesale energy costs “will help fund essential upgrades to our grid”. Pibworth continues: “I simply don’t buy the argument that the cost of the investments needed by the country are pushing up bills. We’re already seeing the benefit of these investments coming through. One of the reasons our bills have been so high is that the cost of electricity is linked to the price of gas, which is one of the most expensive fuels in the system. But renewables are setting the wholesale price more and more of the time, bringing down the influence of gas on the power price.” He says there is “no credible alternative” to continuing to invest in clean energy and adds: “Will future energy bills depend less on global price swings and more on fixed costs? Well, yes – that’s sort of the point. We’ve all seen what happens when you’re too dependent on imported fossil fuels.”

In contrast, an editorial in the climate-sceptic comment pages of the Daily Telegraph runs under the headline: “The headlong rush to net-zero must stop before we are all ruined.” An editorial in the climate-sceptic Daily Mail criticises Miliband as “pompous and patronising”, falsely blaming high energy bills on “Miliband’s green taxes”.

A landmark vote on maritime decarbonisation has been postponed until 2026 after a motion tabled by Singapore and advanced by Saudi Arabia narrowly passed on the final day of the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s extraordinary session in London.

The result was 57 in favour and 49 against, with 21 abstentions – a tight margin that sends mixed signals to C-level executives attempting to strategise for future logistics costs and environmental compliance.

The session is now adjourned for 12 months, during which negotiations are expected to continue.

In his closing remarks, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez said: ""I always look for the silver linings in things. Even though you have difference of opinions, you all spoke in support of the work of this organisation. I will ask you to reflect on this session. The outcome is your decision.""

""Now, you have one year; you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments. You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to a consensus that you make reference to.""

The net-zero framework

The delayed framework is an important piece of regulation that would apply from 2028 to ships over 5,000 gross tonnes.

For procurement departments, its core components represent a tangible future cost.

The NZF establishes binding targets to reduce the carbon intensity of marine fuels and creates a market-based mechanism involving credits and penalties. Under the proposed rules, ships exceeding emission limits would be required to purchase “remedial units”.

In contrast, low-emission vessels could earn and trade surplus credits. The revenue generated would be directed into an IMO Net-Zero Fund.

The fund is intended to support the adoption of clean fuels and assist developing countries in a just transition.

The delay now gives procurement teams more time to model these potential costs, but clouds the timeline for implementation.

Geopolitical pressure and regulatory headwinds

According to the Global Strategic Communications Council, momentum appeared strong for the framework in April when 63 countries backed the package against 16 opposed.

This support wavered as the October vote approached amid intense geopolitical pressure. Delegations from some developing countries cited “undiplomatic” pressure from the US, including threats of tariffs if they supported the framework.

The US position hardened publicly when President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

His post framed the NZF as a Global Green New Deal Tax on Shipping and stated that the US would not adhere to it, urging other member states to vote 'no'.

Future-proofing procurement strategies

An 11 August submission from the US argued that the NZF would establish a de facto global carbon tax, potentially causing inflationary effects for consumers.

It also highlights that zero- and near-zero fuels are not yet commercially available at the required scale and that the framework's GHG Fuel Intensity metric could penalise transitional fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The latest IMO vote represents a critical juncture for procurement leaders whose organisations may have already invested in such transitional technologies.

For both procurement and supply chain executives, a one-year pause changes project timelines but not the fundamental direction of the industry, with the regulatory trajectory continuing to point towards carbon pricing and lifecycle fuel assessments.

Procurement teams should still operate on the assumption that Scope 3 emissions from ocean freight will carry a rising cost, even if the exact start date remains uncertain. Companies with diversified fuel strategies and robust efficiency programmes could maintain a competitive advantage when credit markets are eventually established.

Charterers and their procurement departments would be wise to use this additional year to tighten contract clauses that allocate carbon price and performance risk.

Similarly, logistics partners, including ports and third-party logistics providers (3PLs) investing in infrastructure for methanol, ammonia and shore power, have another 12 months to align capital expenditure with the likely shape of the final regulations.

The core challenge of balancing climate goals with affordability in a sector that handles 80% of global trade remains, with the industry now watching to see if the extra time will lead to consensus or conflict.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a8d071cb8886f402373e42ffe603673b:82114c195dd894933ec919f9fd613576/what-is-international-maritime-organization-imo.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:18:43.719743

The UN-associated body announced Friday that voting on the adoption of the framework, which aims to reduce global shipping emissions, would be postponed by a year.

The framework includes a greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) pricing mechanism and global fuel standards, measures UBS said were expected to boost demand for Accelleron’s turbochargers, fuel injection pumps, and routing software.

With the delay, UBS shifted its assumptions for regulatory-driven demand, now expecting top-line support for Accelleron starting in fiscal year 2027, instead of fiscal 2026, and a more gradual phase-in thereafter.

UBS revised its earnings per share forecasts in Swiss francs to reflect the delayed demand tailwind. Adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged for FY25 at current levels but were lowered by 4% for FY26 and 3% for FY27.

The brokerage also reduced its price target to CHF69 from CHF75 while maintaining a Buy rating on the company.

The IMO’s planned GHG pricing mechanism is designed to encourage emission reductions across global shipping fleets.

Under the proposal, fleets exceeding IMO-defined emission thresholds would be required to purchase “remedial units,” with costs ranging from $100 million to $380 million per ton of CO2 depending on the level of non-compliance. Fleets below thresholds can generate “surplus units” that may be traded.

UBS estimated that funds linked to the emission trading scheme could exceed $10 billion annually once fully adopted, potentially increasing demand for emission-reducing equipment like that produced by Accelleron.

UBS also updated its operating margin forecasts, noting that business mix and operating leverage are key drivers of profitability.

The brokerage now expects adjusted EBIT margins of 25% for FY25, 25.3% for FY26, and 26% for FY27.

Valuation was updated using a discounted cash flow model incorporating the revised FY25-29 estimates, a terminal sales growth assumption of 2.5%, and a weighted average cost of capital of 7.2%.

But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US ‘bullying’.
The adoption of Net-Zero Framework would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition.
We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.","The Clean Shipping Coalition, despite the disappointment, has called on member states to use the time to ensure the framework is strengthened and adopted next time round.

By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.

…said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO.

Maggs also highlighted that with climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.

However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure

…added Maggs.

Furthermore, John Maggs commented that at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.

Echoing the IMO General Secretary’s statement, Maggs underscored that while the Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect, adopting it would have been an important step to deliver on the IMOs commitment and send key signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal.

Delay costs the climate — and coastal, Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction. This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.

…said Elissama Menezes, Co-Founder and Director, Equal Routes.

“Implementing revised Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) targets to improve efficiency of the global fleet; investing in wind to promote its scaling up; agreeing to comprehensive well to wake LCA guidelines which ensure all methane based fuels aren’t part of decarbonation pathways; and adopting mandatory measures in early 2026 at PPR13 to reduce black carbon from shipping emissions can all be moved on now to support the sector’s zero by 2050 ambitions”, she added.

Furthermore, Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, explained that the delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US ‘bullying’.

The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.

…Shaw highlighted.

Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk, noted that getting the Net-Zero Framework adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets.

Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course.

…said Rios.

Rios also remarked that with countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste” she said.

The adoption of Net-Zero Framework would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition.

…Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch, pointed out and further explained that far from rushed, the framework represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort.

It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public. Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost. We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.

…Halle noted.

SEA-LNG, stated that it will use this time to work with its members and other industry organizations to continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work.

The industry will continue on the road to decarbonisation. The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonisation of the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook.

…SEA-LNG stated, highlighting that with industry initiatives dramatically reducing levels of methane emissions onboard and in fuel supply chains, the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane in the coming years, the pathway will continue to deliver reductions of greenhouse gases and local emissions.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_2449532459-e1728393386772.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:19:19.255468

“Stand with the United States and vote NO in London tomorrow,” US President Donald Trump urged other members of the International Maritime Organization via his Truth Social account on X. On Friday, 56 countries obeyed.

In April 2025, a draft agreement was made to set mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas pricing for the shipping sector. Last week, the deal should have been formally adopted. Yet Trump’s threats, along with no love for the deal from recalcitrant petrostate allies such as Saudi Arabia, meant enough countries came together to reject it.

The net zero framework is the intended pathway for the IMO, the UN’s body for global shipping, to bring international shipping in line with its 2023 greenhouse gas strategy.

Under the rules, vessels of more than 5,000 gross tonnage would have to hit a “base” target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from their fuels by 4 per cent or face a tax of $380 a tonne for emissions above this level.

A majority of the 176 IMO member states — 63 — had approved the carbon pricing mechanism in April, with 16 countries against it and the rest abstaining. But UN procedure stated that it had to be reaffirmed by two-thirds of members last week.

No clarity for industry

Negotiations on a decarbonisation framework for shipping have been ongoing for two decades.

Global Maritime Forum director of decarbonisation Jesse Fahnestock said Friday’s decision was “a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey”.

He invited countries supportive of the NZF to “reconfirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed greenhouse gas strategy”.

The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping insisted the delay did “not mean the framework has failed”. The 2023 GHG strategy remains in place, said the research centre, calling for shipping to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

While the delay provides additional time to build consensus . . . momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult. Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation

Rico Luman, ING

It admitted, however, that: “For now, the industry will not have the clarity it needs on a global set of rules and incentives to drive investment.”

And the centre called on IMO member states to use the next 12 months to achieve a global framework that can deliver certainty for long-term planning and investment, incentives to accelerate innovation and deployment of sustainable solutions, and fairness through a just and equitable transition for developing states.

Fading momentum

But others were less optimistic about a greener future for shipping.

Rico Luman, senior economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said the delay “reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal” and “is likely to strengthen opposition”.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus — also within different shipping segments — momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” he added. “Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation.”

Luman warned that projected CO₂ reductions by 2030 “already fall short of earlier ambitions”, and that achieving the 2040 and 2050 targets set out in the IMO’s net zero strategy “is becoming increasingly challenging — particularly given the long investment horizons typical in the shipping industry”.

Research published last month showed the sector was not on target to meet an interim target mandating that zero or near-zero emission fuels represent at least 5 per cent of the sector’s fuel use by 2030.

Luman added: “From an economic standpoint, introducing carbon pricing is essential to level the playing field with sustainable fuels, which are currently not economically viable. Regardless of the timing, a pricing mechanism will eventually be necessary to drive progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, also as it helps funding green investments.”

EU versus the US

Trump had already made clear earlier this year that the US would be an obstructive force, repeatedly threatening other IMO member states with retaliatory tariffs if they approved the proposal.

The EU, on the other hand, had signalled its backing for the deal ahead of Friday’s meeting.

The EU fought until the very last moment to get the IMO NZF across the finishing line, but the bully who played dirty was ultimately stronger

Faig Abbasov, T&E

“The EU fought until the very last moment to get the IMO NZF across the finishing line, but the bully who played dirty was ultimately stronger,” said Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-profit Transport & Environment.

“The EU has its own climate laws for international shipping. These need to be safeguarded and strengthened in the coming years,” he added. “The bloc must also work with other countries bilaterally to help them develop their own national rules.”

No satisfying Trump

T&E executive director William Todts said the EU should take wider lessons from Friday’s decision.

“The US under Trump is not looking to slow down clean energy and climate action,” wrote Todts on LinkedIn. “It wants to destroy it. The sooner we fully accept the implications of this, the better.

“No amount of concessions will ever satisfy Trump and the fossil fuel guys that work for him. Some Europeans thought sacrificing the EU’s shipping rules might appease the Donald and his friends. He killed the deal anyway.”

Todts urged the EU to “better remember that when he goes after CBAM [Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism]”.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c6177312-1677-4665-a147-1993b412af9e.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:19:24.880620

How will the maritime industry and global policymakers reconcile economic interests with the urgent need for environmental action in the coming years?","The maritime industry, a critical player in global trade, faces a crossroads as international efforts to regulate its emissions hit a significant roadblock. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently postponed a decision on imposing a landmark charge on vessel emissions. This decision highlights the complexities of international climate diplomacy, especially amid strong opposition from the Trump administration. The proposed rules, which would have been the first global fixed charge on emissions for any industry, have been years in the making. The delay raises important questions about the future of environmental regulation and the global commitment to reducing carbon emissions.

Trump Administration’s Influence on Global Regulations

The postponement of the IMO’s decision underscores the influence of the Trump administration on international environmental policy. The U.S. strongly opposed the proposed ship emissions charges, framing them as a “global carbon tax” that would disproportionately impact American businesses. This stance reflects a broader pattern of resistance to multilateral environmental agreements under Trump’s leadership.

U.S. officials warned of potential economic repercussions, suggesting that shipping costs could increase by up to 10 percent or more. The administration’s rhetoric included threats of port levies, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties against countries supporting the emissions charge. Such measures highlight the administration’s aggressive approach to safeguarding national economic interests at the expense of global environmental initiatives.

In addition to direct opposition, the U.S. proposed procedural changes to the adoption process, advocating for an explicit opt-in requirement from nations. This shift from a “tacit acceptance” process would create additional hurdles for implementing the emissions charge, further complicating international consensus.

Global Reactions and Shifting Alliances

The U.S. stance has had a noticeable impact on international alliances concerning the emissions charge. While the plan initially had widespread support, recent developments reveal signs of wavering among key nations. For instance, Athens, traditionally skeptical due to potential impacts on its maritime industry, considered abstaining from the vote.

Singapore, once a supporter of the plan, joined Saudi Arabia in suggesting a delay in voting. This shift indicates a recalibration of priorities in the face of U.S. pressure and the economic ramifications of the proposed charge. The postponement marks a setback for those advocating for stringent environmental regulations within the shipping industry.

The International Chamber of Shipping expressed disappointment with the delay, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity to enable investments in decarbonizing the sector. This sentiment echoes a broader frustration among stakeholders eager for decisive action to address the maritime industry’s environmental impact.

Implications for Climate Policy and Emissions Reduction

The delay in implementing the carbon levy highlights the broader challenges facing international climate diplomacy. Despite the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. continues to wield significant influence over global climate talks. The maritime industry’s emissions, accounting for over one percent of global totals, represent a substantial target for regulatory efforts.

The planned emissions charge was a key component of the IMO’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions in the maritime sector by mid-century. However, the delay threatens the timeline for reaching this ambitious goal. The Trump administration’s actions reflect a broader trend of dismantling domestic climate policies and challenging international efforts to curb emissions.

As companies reassess their climate commitments amid shifting political landscapes, the marketing advantages of green credentials are waning. The reality of meeting ambitious emissions targets is becoming increasingly complex, raising questions about the future of voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Maritime Emissions Regulation

The postponement of the emissions charge vote leaves the maritime industry in a state of uncertainty. The IMO’s inability to reach a consensus at this juncture underscores the difficulties inherent in coordinating international climate policy across diverse economic and political landscapes.

For the industry to progress toward decarbonization, clear and consistent regulations are essential. The delay in implementing the carbon levy complicates investment decisions and strategic planning for companies committed to reducing their environmental impact.

As global climate talks continue, the maritime industry must navigate the complexities of international diplomacy and domestic political pressures. The outcome of the COP30 summit in Brazil will be a critical indicator of the international community’s resolve to address maritime emissions in the face of geopolitical challenges.

The IMO’s decision to delay the emissions charge vote raises critical questions about the future of international climate cooperation. How will the maritime industry and global policymakers reconcile economic interests with the urgent need for environmental action in the coming years?

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

“The energy transition of the shipping industry has never been an easy task. It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.

Following tense and dramatic deliberations, the divided industry has reacted strongly to the development.

Thomas A. Kazakos, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), was among the first to respond. He expressed disappointment that Member States had not been able to agree on a way forward at this meeting, emphasizing the need for clarity so the industry can make the investments required to decarbonize in line with the IMO GHG Strategy.

Global Maritime Forum (GMF) Director of Decarbonisation, Jesse Fahnestock, also voiced disappointment, noting that Member States that had decisively agreed on the framework in April were now facing exceptional political barriers to adoption.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging.”

…said Fahnestock, while urging the Member States who supported the framework in April to reaffirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue urgently working on guidelines and regulatory measures that align with the IMO’s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) issued a statement acknowledging the difficult and complex nature of the negotiations, while emphasizing the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the IMO Net-Zero Framework:

“The IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. We are committed to continuing work with governments to deliver the necessary regulatory consistency, support renewable fuel production and infrastructure, and keep shipping’s energy transition on track.”

…the WSC statement highlights.

Commenting on the outcome, Tim Wilkins, Managing Director of INTERTANKO, saw the delay as an opportunity:

“This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF.”

Emma Scheiris, Deputy Director – Environment at INTERTANKO, added that the industry is ready to accelerate progress, highlighting that cooperation is key to forming an improved robust, pragmatic and realistic version of the NZF.

INTERCARGO echoed this sentiment, characterizing the postponement as a potential window for constructive dialogue. The organization emphasized that this time should be used effectively to bridge differing positions among IMO Member States and to ensure that the shipping industry’s input is heard.

“We invite Member States at IMO to work more closely among them but also in partnership with the shipping community towards agreeing on a regulatory framework that is realistic, practical, and globally workable.”

…commented Kostas Gkonis, Secretary General, INTERCARGO.

European Shipowners | ECSA also highlighted that the adoption of the IMO agreement is crucial to deliver on the transition of international shipping to net-zero emissions and to ensure an international level playing field in regulation.

Furthermore, the International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) reaffirmed its support for the IMO Net-Zero Framework and expressed disappointment at the outcome, which diverged from the expectations of many international associations.

“IBIA supported the adoption of the NZF and were already engaged in crucial work on the detailed guidelines. Meanwhile, a majority of IMO’s Member States weren’t prepared to move ahead, making shipping the first sector with a global regulatory framework to decarbonise.”

…IBIA highlighted.

The International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) took a firm stance, describing the postponement as a major setback for the global framework needed to drive decarbonisation investments at sea and on land:

“This is a major setback for the maritime industry. Shipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation. Only IMO can provide such a framework.”

…said IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven, who also warned that the delay could lead to more national and regional measures, complicating the regulatory landscape and creating unintended consequences.

The Norwegian Maritime Authority similarly expressed disappointment at the postponement:

“This was not the result we wanted. We have worked for a long time to get this agreement in place, and postponing it now only creates uncertainty. Global problems need global solutions. The climate agreement that was on the table was well-worked and good, and a decision that many have been waiting for.”

…said Bjelland Eriksen, Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment, who reaffirmed Norway’s commitment to securing a global climate agreement for shipping.

On a similar note, Danish Shipping underlined that geopolitical tensions had derailed the green transition of international shipping. It stressed that the agreement would have had a positive effect on reducing the price gap between fossil and alternative fuels, an essential component of the transition.

“This is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it’s a big disappointment.”

…said Danish Shipping’s CEO, Anne H. Steffensen.

Furthermore, the Greek Minister of Shipping and Insular Policy, Vassilis Kikilias remarked that the negotiations were challenging and highlighted serious shortcomings regarding implementation timelines, the unfair treatment of LNG as a fuel and the unjustifiably high penalties on shipping which, if adopted, could have caused significant disruptions to global trade and increases in product prices.

To the disappointment expressed in the heat of the moment by several leading associations in this market, have now been added manifestations of more or less accentuated disappointment than other representatives of the sector.

Regret for the missed opportunity was expressed by the CLECAT, the European association representing companies of shipping and logistics, which reiterated the importance of a global regulatory framework defined by the IMO to prevent the Carbon leakage from transportation maritime. CLECAT highlighted that ""regulations inconsistent regional inconsistencies could encourage carriers to redirect ships to areas with less stringent environmental standards. Fragmentation - underlined the association - not only would weaken decarbonisation efforts, but would also create unfair competition conditions, in particular for operators European. The maritime sector needs clarity, not further uncertainty"". CLECAT specified that it will continue to commit to a robust regulatory framework in line with the global climate goals.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) and Intercargo, the associations representing respectively the shipowners who Fleets of container ships operate and those operating fleets bulk carriers, urged the use of the one-year postponement to fill some gaps that in their opinion the current draft presents settlement agreement, in order to ensure an effective global agreement. Recalling that ""the 2023 IMO Greenhouse Gas Strategy and the investment trajectory remain aligned towards the goal of net zero emissions by 2050', the WSC reiterated the need for 'an agreed framework to global level to ensure a level playing field for achieve this goal. The maritime transport sector of line - specified the association - is committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and has invested $150 billion in ships designed to work with ecological fuels. The IMO remains the right venue to provide a global solution. We are committed to continuing to cooperate with governments to ensure the necessary regulatory consistency, support production and infrastructure for renewable fuels and maintaining the energy transition of maritime transport on the good road.""

Intercargo also reiterated its support for the IMO ""in as the only global regulator capable of adopting consistent measures and effective for international maritime transport. Hope that the current postponement - commented the Secretary General of Intercargo, Kostas Gkonis - represents an opportunity for a further dialogue. The time ahead should be used in a constructive and effective way to bridge differences of position between IMO Member States and to ensure that the voice and the contribution of the sector are listened to and acknowledged. We invite the IMO Member States to cooperate more closely between but also in partnership with the maritime community, to agree on a realistic, practical and applicable regulatory framework global level"".

The International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), the voice of operators active in the segment of the supply of fuels to the naval sector, taking note of the joke of the strategy imposed by the MEPC, a meeting from which the expected a different outcome, reiterated his support for the efforts for the decarbonization of shipping at the IMO by taking whereas at present the issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular the pricing of emissions, is evidently politically controversial for many countries to the point that reaching a consensus at this stage is not possible.

Much less optimistic was the reaction of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the international association which deals with all issues of environmental protection, according to which ""the current delay in the adoption of Net-Zero Framework represents a missed opportunity and - specified Natacha Stamatiou, Head of Global Shipping and EDF Delegation at the IMO - a setback that will derail the timeline agreed by countries as part of the 2023 strategy of the International Maritime Organization. Any delay - has denounced - means that innovation will have difficulties inequalities will widen and the transition will become more widespread. towards clean shipping will become more difficult and expensive"". The association noted that the postponement ""delays crucial progress, postponing the start of the implementation initially planned for 2028 and slowing down the negotiations on the detailed guidelines that should have start next week on the occasion of the twentieth Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ISWG-GHG 20)'.

A missed opportunity

UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres viewed the outcome as “a missed opportunity for Member States to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net-zero emissions.”

He stressed that decarbonizing the maritime sector – responsible for about 80 per cent of global trade – “is critical.”

Media reports cited opposition from several major economies – including the United States – which argued that the proposed global pricing mechanism risked functioning as a “carbon tax” and could raise shipping costs by more than 10 per cent.

Emergency Care Needs to Be Prioritised

Syllabus: Health

Source: TH

Context: The recent stampede in Karur, Tamil Nadu, highlighted gaps in India’s emergency response system, sparking renewed calls to treat emergency medical care not merely as a service, but as a constitutional duty ensuring every citizen’s right to life.

About Emergency Care Needs to Be Prioritised:

Evolution of Emergency Care:

Modern emergency medicine evolved from wartime trauma management during the World Wars, where organised triage and rapid evacuation became critical.

The industrial revolution and advances in trauma and cardiovascular medicine led to structured ambulance systems with life-support capability.

Over time, the focus expanded from mere transport to on-site stabilisation, giving rise to paramedic-led and doctor-led mobile emergency units.

India’s 108 Emergency Response System, introduced under the National Health Mission (NHM), institutionalised public access to emergency transport.

The concept evolved globally into the “Golden Hour” and later the “Platinum Ten Minutes”, emphasising response speed as a determinant of survival.

Constitutional Imperative:

The Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution inherently guarantees access to timely emergency medical care.

The State is ethically bound to ensure unobstructed emergency access during mass gatherings and disasters.

Science of Timely Intervention:

Acute illnesses and trauma cause rapid circulatory collapse; immediate diagnosis and treatment can reverse these life-threatening disturbances.

The “Golden Hour” represents the crucial 60 minutes post-injury when intervention can prevent irreversible organ damage.

The evolved “Platinum Ten Minutes” standard stresses that medical help—not just transport—should reach the victim within 10 minutes.

Modern ambulances act as mobile ICUs, equipped with oxygen supply, defibrillators, ECG, airway management tools, and telemedicine links.

Timely, skilled intervention transforms outcomes, reducing preventable deaths from strokes, heart attacks, and trauma.

Existing Initiatives:

The 108 Ambulance Service, a public-private partnership, operates over 10,000 ambulances, serving 7–9 million patients annually.

Tamil Nadu leads with an average response time of 10 minutes 14 seconds, close to the Platinum Ten benchmark.

The National Ambulance Code (AIS-125) sets standards for design, safety, and equipment across vehicle categories.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, mandates right of way for ambulances and penalises obstruction.

NHM support enables State-level flexibility in managing emergency systems and training first responders.

Challenges in Emergency Systems:

Fragmented services: Wide disparities exist between States and private providers, leading to uneven quality.

Skill shortage: Lack of certified emergency medical technicians and high attrition rates weaken continuity.

Infrastructure gaps: Many ambulances lack advanced life support systems and telemedicine integration.

Poor coordination: Weak linkages between call centres, hospitals, and ambulance teams delay response.

Accountability vacuum: Absence of a National Emergency Regulatory Authority results in inconsistent standards and oversight.

Policy Reforms and Recommendations:

Constitute a National Emergency Services Regulatory Authority to standardise training, operations, and equipment across States.

Integrate technology through AI-based dispatch systems, GPS tracking, and real-time data sharing with hospitals.

Introduce national certification and pay parity for paramedics to improve retention and professionalism.

Expand air and drone ambulances for remote access and organ transport logistics.

Mandate emergency access protocols for public gatherings and urban infrastructure planning.

Promote PPP models for integrated emergency networks linking urban and rural areas.

Conclusion:

A nation capable of robotic surgeries and organ transplants must not lose lives to delayed ambulances or disorganised response systems. Emergency medical care must evolve from fragmented services into a right-based, standardised national mission. Recognising it as a constitutional and moral duty is essential to ensure that every citizen receives help when every second counts.

Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)

Source: DH

Context: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) crossed 300 (“very poor”).

About Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP):

What it is?

The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a statutory framework that specifies stage-wise measures to be implemented to combat deteriorating air quality in the National Capital Region. It provides predefined actions based on the severity of pollution.

Established in: GRAP was first introduced in 2017 under the directives of the Supreme Court of India and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Later revised by the CAQM in December 2024 to include predictive action based on IMD and IITM forecasts.

Aim: The plan aims to create a graded and preemptive response system for air quality management by identifying specific interventions to be taken as the AQI worsens in Delhi-NCR.

Criteria / Stages: GRAP classifies air quality into four categories based on AQI levels and corresponding actions:

Stage Category AQI Range Actions Stage I Poor 201–300 Dust control, waste removal, enforcement of vehicle norms Stage II Very Poor 301–400 Mechanical sweeping, C&D monitoring, DG set regulations Stage III Severe 401–450 Restrictions on BS-III/IV vehicles, construction limits Stage IV Severe+ Above 450 Ban on truck entry, WFH orders, halting C&D projects

Key Features of GRAP:

Dynamic implementation: Actions are activated dynamically based on real-time AQI data and IMD/IITM forecasts, allowing authorities to respond before pollution peaks.

Cumulative approach: Each higher stage includes all measures from lower stages, ensuring progressive tightening of restrictions as air quality worsens.

Inter-agency coordination: Implementation involves coordinated efforts among CAQM, CPCB, SPCBs, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), and Traffic Police, ensuring accountability at every level.

Predictive enforcement: Measures are invoked in advance when forecasts show a likely rise in AQI, promoting preventive rather than reactive air quality management.

Green Crackers

Source: IE

Context: As Diwali approaches, discussions around the environmental impact of fireworks have resurfaced, with experts highlighting that green crackers—though less polluting—are not entirely clean.

About Green Crackers:

What it is?

Green crackers are eco-modified firecrackers developed by CSIR–NEERI to reduce emissions of particulate matter, toxic gases, and noise levels compared to conventional fireworks. They aim to provide a safer alternative that maintains festivity while minimizing pollution.

Chemical Components: They are formulated without barium nitrate, a major toxic component, and instead use safer substitutes like potassium nitrate, strontium salts, zeolite, and iron oxide. These additives help capture soot and reduce metallic residues such as aluminium and copper in emissions.

How it works?

The redesigned chemical composition enables controlled oxidation and reduced combustion temperature, producing light and sound with 30–40% lower PM₂.₅, SO₂, and NOₓ emissions.

Compounds like zeolite act as absorbents for dust and gaseous by-products, limiting pollutant release.

Features:

Developed under the CSIR–NEERI certification system with a QR code for authenticity.

Include variants such as SWAS (Safe Water Releaser), STAR (Safe Thermite Cracker), and SAFAL (Safe Minimal Aluminium).

Reduce harmful metal oxides and heavy metal toxicity.

Comply with Supreme Court-mandated emission limits and Pollution Control Board norms.

Designed to maintain traditional colours and brightness with safer chemistry.

Significance:

Green crackers represent a transitional innovation toward sustainable celebrations, reducing air, soil, and noise pollution during festivals.

They align with India’s net-zero and clean air goals, making the country the only nation with a formal government-backed programme

Nauru

Source: DD News

Context: Australia has defended its A$2.5 billion, 30-year agreement with Nauru to resettle deported non-citizens, a move criticised by human rights groups who allege it shifts refugee responsibility to smaller, aid-dependent Pacific nations.

About Nauru:

Country Profile:

Nauru is a micronation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, recognized as the world’s third-smallest country by land area and population. It functions as a unitary parliamentary republic with a 19-member legislature.

Geographic Location:

Located 25 miles south of the Equator, Nauru lies in southeastern Micronesia, about 800 km northeast of the Solomon Islands and 300 km west of Kiribati’s Banaba Island.

Its land area is only 21 sq. km, making it one of the most compact sovereign states globally.

Administrative Centre: The nation lacks an official capital, but the district of Yaren hosts the Parliament, Presidential offices, and administrative institutions, serving as the de facto capital.

Geological and Environmental Features:

The island is a raised coral atoll with a ring of fertile coastal land encircling Buada Lagoon, its only inland water body.

The interior plateau, elevated about 100 feet above sea level, is rich in phosphate rock derived from ancient bird guano deposits.

Phosphate mining has degraded over 80% of Nauru’s land, creating sharp limestone pinnacles and limiting agriculture.

The island faces severe freshwater scarcity, with rainfall-dependent reservoirs and imported water supplies.

Significance:

Nauru’s economy relies heavily on phosphate exports, Australian aid, and offshore asylum processing revenues.

It remains a key geopolitical partner for Australia, hosting a detention and resettlement facility under a long-term migration and defence cooperation framework.

Despite extensive deliberations and the submission of a finalized draft text, consensus could not be reached among Member States.

MEPC/ES.2 considered adoption of two amendments to MARPOL Annex VI:

The IMO NZF, setting out new requirements on GHG fuel intensity, in combination with a pricing and reward mechanism

Designation of the North-East Atlantic as an ECA for SOx, PM and NOx.

MEPC remained divided throughout the meeting and during the final day, a majority of 57 member states voted to adjourn the meeting for one year, while 49 voted to continue. This means that the amendments were not adopted, and the meeting continues in October 2026. This means that the possible entry into force will be on 1 March 2028 earliest.

Finalization of the IMO Net-Zero Framework

Latest updates to the text

At its extraordinary session, MEPC established a drafting group which made several editorial modifications to text approved at MEPC 83.

Clarification on the relationship between SEEMP and the GFI

Regulation 26 on the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP was amended to clarify that the SEEMP part IV requirements relating to chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex V (the GFI) are only subject to verification while SEEMP requirements relating to the CII (SEEMP part III) are subject to both verification and company audits.

This distinction was made due to conceptual incompatibility between company audits under SEEMP and the GFI framework. Unlike the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the GFI does not require corrective action plans or continuous improvement plans. Instead, the IMO Net Zero Fund assesses ship performance solely on the types of fuel used, and on whether these meet or not the requirements.

The amendments also clarify that SEEMP part II requirements are also subject to verification.

Usage of surplus units

Paragraph 12 of regulation 36 was amended to clarify that Surplus units could be banked and then transferred during subsequent reporting periods. Appendix XIII, which governs the Statement of Compliance was updated to reflect rules pertaining to surplus unit transfers such as recording the year of issue and expiry and adding fields to accommodate the transfer of surplus units between ships. The validity of these surplus units was capped at two years.

Other technical and editorial improvements:

The definition of a “new ship” applicable to chapter V was simplified. Instead of using a three-date criterion like with the EEDI, only the delivery date of the vessel as clearer temporal cut-offs.

The phrase “fuel and/or energy sources” may be amended to simply “fuel,” as the existing definition of fuel is already broad enough to encompass energy sources.

The term “reporting period” was replaced with “calendar year,” thereby enabling new ships to report for “part of the calendar year”.

Provisions related to company changes, transfer, end-of-life reporting duties were also clarified.

The compliance formula was corrected to explicitly include the ×10⁻⁶ conversion factor, ensuring consistent units from grams to tonnes.

The GFI registry is required to also record the energy consumption from each fuel j, and its GHG intensity (EIj).

The “amount of ZNZs used” is required to be reported in energy units (MJ) rather than in CO₂ equivalents.

Proposal for North-East Atlantic Ocean Emission Control Area (ECA)

MEPC 83 approved a proposal to designate the North-East Atlantic Ocean as an Emission Control Area (ECA) for sulphur oxides (SOₓ), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter (PM).

NOx Tier III requirements for this ECA would have used the same three date criterion used for the Norwegian ECA: meaning it applies to ships with a building contract placed on or after 1 January 2027, or in absence of contract, keel laying on or after 1 July 2027, or which are delivered on or after 1 January 2031.

SOx requirements require the use fuel oil with sulphur content not exceeding 0.10% m/m in the ECA with starting on 1 March 2028.

Amendments relating to multiple engine operational profiles for marine diesel engine

MEPC 83 adopted amendments to the Nox Technical Code 2008 a marine diesel engine, including clarifying engine test cycles. Related amendments to MARPOL Annex VI were considered during this session.

These amendments would have clarified entries in data reporting required by Regulations 27 and 28 relating to multiple engine operational profiles for a marine diesel engine. They include:

updating the definition of “irrational emission control strategy,”;

adding new rows for Tier I, II, and III to indicate Multiple Engine Operational Profiles in Appendix I (IAPP Certificate);

updating the text in Appendix II (Test Cycles and Weighting Factors) to better reflect test cycle details for different types of marine diesel engines, and finally updating test cycle details for different types of marine diesel engines;

updating Appendix IX (Information to Be Submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil) by introducing two sets of fuel reporting dates for ships that undergo a flag change within the year. These changes resolve discrepancies between Regulations 27 (IMO DCS) and 28 (CII) that cause confusion in annual fuel consumption reporting and replace the term “Oil-Fired Boiler(s)” with “Fired Boiler(s)” to ensure that Appendix IX accurately reflects other equipment such as gas-fired boilers.

IMO DCS accessibility

Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Regulation 27 were proposed to broaden access to the DCS data thereby increasing transparency. These amendments, meant to become effective 1 March 2027, would have allowed Recognized Organizations acting on behalf of a ship’s Administration to have full access to the DCS database, grant full access (for analytical purposes) to all Parties to MARPOL Annex VI, and provide anonymized data access to public user accounts so that individual ships cannot be identified.

Review of short-term measures

The review clauses of the short-term measures were considered to no longer reference 1 January 2026 as a deadline (as phase 1 of the review was completed) but instead refer to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy.

Reduction of GHG emissions from ships

Agenda for ISWG-GHG 20

The 20th session of the Intersessional Meeting of the Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) will be held from October 20 to 24, 2025.

The following matters will be discussed during the session:

Development of new and/or revision of existing guidelines, provisions, guidance and other documents, as appropriate, for supporting the uniform and effective implementation of the IMO Net-Zero Framework:

a. Fuel certification

b. ZNZ definition and/or reward

c. IMO Net-Zero Fund

d. GFI and GFI compliance approaches

e. IMO GFI Registry

Further consideration of the development of the IMO Life Cycle GHG Assessment (LCA) framework.

It’s a question that some prominent people are asking this week after the increasingly woke and essentially useless globalist body attempted to sneak a global carbon tax in through the back door while no one was looking.

Except someone was looking, as it turns out. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the powerful Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is part of the majority on both the Senate Judiciary and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, said in an X post Thursday evening that this latest bit of anti-American action “warrants our withdrawal from the UN.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in his own X post on the matter on Wednesday that the Trump administration “will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies. Under the leadership of POTUS (President Donald Trump), the U.S. will be a hard NO. We call on other nations to stand alongside the United States in defense of our citizens and sovereignty.” (RELATED: Trump Admin Blows Up UN ‘Global Green New Scam’ Tax Push, Forcing Pullback)

On Friday afternoon, Mr. Rubio took to X again to announce the news that efforts by himself and others in the Trump administration succeeded in killing an effort to move the tax forward during a meeting in London. However, the proposal is not fully dead – a final vote on it was simply delayed for a year.

The issue at hand stems from an attempt by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) – an agency of the U.N. – to impose net-zero rules on fuels used for seaborne shipping operations. The Trump administration estimates the imposition of the new requirements will increase the cost of shipping goods by about 10%, thus creating yet another round of inflation hitting the poorest citizens the hardest thanks to the globalist obsession with the amount of plant food – carbon dioxide – in the atmosphere.

Known as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, the proposal claims it would effectively “zero out” emissions from the shipping industry by 2050.

The potential implications if the U.N. ultimately succeeds in implementing its own global carbon tax are obvious. If this unelected, unaccountable globalist body can levy a carbon tax on Americans, a concept that America’s own elected officials have steadfastly rejected across the terms of the last five U.S. presidents, what would then prevent it from imposing other kinds of taxes on the world to support its ideological goals?

President Trump’s opposition to exactly this kind of international intrusion into America’s domestic policy choices is the reason why he has twice won the presidency, each time de-committing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords.

It has become increasingly obvious in recent years that the central goal of the global climate alarm movement is to dramatically raise the cost of all kinds of energy in order to force the masses to live smaller, more restricted lives and make their behavior easier for authoritarian governments to control. This camel’s nose under the tent move by the U.N. to sneak a global carbon tax into reality is just the latest in a long parade of examples that serve as proof points for that thesis.

At some point, U.S. officials must seriously reassess the value proposition in continuing to spend billions of dollars each year supporting and hosting a globalist organization whose every action seems designed to inflict damage on our country and its people. Now would be a good time to do that, in fact.

The IMO finalized the draft in April 2025. Its proposed system resembles a cap‑and‑trade model, with carbon charges between $100 and $380 per metric ton on emissions of the life-essential gas carbon dioxide (CO₂). This had the potential to generate $10–12 billion annually for a UN‑administered “green transition grift” fund.

This summer, the U.S. robustly rejected these plans.

Still, the globalist grifters persisted and had planned to take a vote this week to formalize the rules and begin confiscating the dirty carbon dollars for global bureaucrats.

However, President Donald Trump’s band of economic and trade warriors have prevailed for the time being and the IMO has voted to delay for one year a decision on implementing a global maritime climate tax.

A majority of countries at the U.N. shipping agency voted on Friday to postpone by a year a decision on a global carbon price on international shipping, after failing to reach consensus on the emissions reduction measure amid U.S. pressure.

The delay is a blow to the European Union and other countries including Brazil which have been pushing for the shipping industry to go greener and set out a price mechanism for decarbonisation.

Washington and Riyadh, the world’s two largest oil producers, have strongly opposed a carbon price on shipping during talks in London at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

After days of disagreements, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries with 49 opposed who sought to continue with a deal.

The decision came after President Donald Trump calling this proposal a “scam tax” and and threatened reprisals on countries supporting it.

This is a huge win for the Trump Team, the U.S., and nations who appreciate functional trade networks and affordable prices for their citizens.

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz tweeted: “This is another HUGE win for @POTUS. Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Secretary of State Marc Rubio echoed the same message, calling it “another HUGE win” and thanking the president’s leadership for preventing what he characterized as “a massive UN tax hike on American consumers.”

This pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year’s time.

Globalist climate cultists and green-grifters are hardest hit.

The World Shipping Council called it a “carefully balanced regulatory package.” Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, backed the measure too. “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” Thomas A. Kazakos, the International Chamber’s Secretary General said in a statement Friday after the vote. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector.”

Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister of Vanuatu, a small Pacific island nation among the world’s most vulnerable to sea level rise, called it “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

The importance of this halt can’t be over-stated. The bureaucrats didn’t expect it, and I assert that after another year of more reliable science that is actually published, more social media of sharing more rational new reports confirming that there is no climate crisis, and continued efforts by the Trump Team to protect our national interests. this deal will die completely at the next vote.

Absolutely none of the maritime experts I interviewed early this week thought the US could pull this off. Zero. Massive amounts of money, NGO influence, diplomatic threat and media manipulation were behind this… and the American media (except

@gCaptain and Fox News) was dead silent.

And yet Trump did it.

“That Trump Truth Social post sent shockwaves through the building,” one UN delegate in London told me. “NOBODY expected it. The Secretary General @IMOSecGen looked like a deer in the headlights this morning.”

It’s beginning to dawn on many people that this framework was a move for the United Nations to collect taxes on a global scale.

The vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body, in April.

The decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.

Washington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.

In advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.

Proponents of the plan had gone into a meeting of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) with cautious optimism.
Earlier this year, nations agreed to set steadily increasing emissions-intensity limits on vessels under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Proponents of the plan had gone into a meeting of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) with cautious optimism. Earlier this year, nations agreed to set steadily increasing emissions-intensity limits on vessels under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework. Owners of large vessels would have been required to cut emissions by as much as 43 percent by 2035, compared to a 2008 baseline. The framework was hailed as the first time an industry would be so regulated at a global level.

The IMO meeting was expected to adopt the plan then move to implementation, but support drained away after the U.S. threatened to impose tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that backed the plan. On Friday, the nations voted to postpone a decision for a year.

‘Unprecedented effort’

“During the past three days, an unprecedented U.S.-led effort to block a global agreement has culminated in multiple spontaneous proposals, and intense pressure both on and out of the floor,” said Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, a nonprofit with offices in multiple European countries. “It is a clear effort to enact climate denialism, undo years of constructive negotiation and abandon the very targets the IMO has set for itself.”

The decision will slow efforts by companies to reduce shipping emissions, which form a significant part of Scope 3 inventories, particularly for retailers and consumer packaged goods businesses. Maritime shipping accounted for around 2.5 percent of IKEA’s value-chain emissions in 2024, for instance. The company is aiming to purchase only zero-emissions ocean transport services by 2040.

“This is a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” said a spokesperson for Maersk, which operates more than 700 container vessels on routes between 130 countries.

Currently, companies intent on tackling these emissions rely on a patchwork of initiatives including Katalist, a “book and claim” platform that allows them to support and take credit for purchases of low-carbon maritime fuels, such as ammonia and methanol. Members include Amazon, IKEA, Levi Strauss, Mondelez International and Patagonia.

That project and others continue, but spread of the new technologies will be far slower in the absence of the rules the framework would have imposed.

“We are in a very early part of a transition, and more than 99% of maritime transport is still powered by fossil fuels,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit that partners with shipping companies. “So to get alternative fuels and the vessels that can use them out there, the regulatory framework is a hugely important lever.”

Talks continue

Despite the pressure from the U.S. and others, nations agreed to delay rather than scrap the framework altogether. Fahnestock noted that because the proposal is still live, discussions about the details of implementation scheduled over the next 12 months may continue as planned.

“Our impression is that the how of the framework is going to continue,” he said. Talks will focus on which fuels qualify as lower-carbon, rules for life-cycle analysis of the fuels and how proceeds credits, which vessel owners can use to meet missed targets, will be distributed.

Still, standing in the way of an agreement is the world’s largest economy. In a joint statement issued last week, U.S. secretaries for state, energy and transportation said they were considering sanctions against officials from countries that support the IMO framework and blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shutterstock-Image-2600765743-e1760735137801.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:10.877509

To encourage shippers in this vital endeavor, the UN wants the IMO to slap a ""carbon tax"" on the industry. This tax would not reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one single molecule. But hey! It's a ""global emergency"" after all, and everyone has to do their part, right?

Where is all that money from the carbon tax going? To new technology to scrub the atmosphere? If only. Instead, the proceeds from the tax will go to ""developing"" (""poor"") nations to help them deal with bad weather.

In other words, it's just another idea to transfer massive amounts of cash to countries that don't have it. This global equity scheme has been part of the UN climate agenda since the beginning.

Donald Trump and the U.S. were having none of it.

Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at an Australian university, said “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework.""

A State Department official told CNN, “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”

Fox News:

Administration officials argue the framework would give unelected international bureaucrats the power to tax U.S. companies and consumers while doing little to cut global emissions.

""This week, the UN is attempting to pass the first global carbon tax, which will increase energy, food, and fuel costs across the world. We will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies,"" Rubio wrote on X.

""This is a bigger deal than I think anybody realizes,"" U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz said on Fox News.

Supporters counter that a uniform carbon price is the only way to push the shipping industry — responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — to meet net-zero targets by mid-century.

The U.S. pulled out all the stops to beat back this effort to tax the 90% of goods in the world that are shipped overseas. It was always nothing more than what the climate lobby thought would be, an easy smash and grab, transferring trillions of dollars from rich nations to poor nations in order to fund the poor nation's switch to clean energy.

How much of that cash would have ended up in the pockets of the kleptocrats running those benighted nations was never mentioned.

Trump threatened to retaliate against any nation that voted for the carbon tax on shipping. Some of those retaliatory measures, listed in the State Department press release, show that the U.S. was deadly serious about the tax.

Freight Waves:

In the U.S. statement, retaliatory measures against nations voting for the plan could include:

Blocking vessels from U.S. ports;

Probes and possible regulations over those nations’ anti-competitive practices;

Visa restrictions for vessel crews;

Penalties covering U.S. government contracts for new commercial ships and liquified natural gas terminals;

Additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by those countries;

Sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Other oil-producing nations also opposed the tax, as did China and India. We'll have to go through the whole ordeal again next year when the IMO has its annual meeting and the fight to adopt a global carbon tax on shipping will resume.

The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote “No” on the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

The world’s largest maritime nations were deliberating Friday on regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions as U.S. President Donald Trump and others vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social asking countries to vote “No” and that “The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Representatives from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and a host of other nations are against the regulations passing through in its current form. The meetings on Friday witnessed a tense start as they continued their discussions from earlier in the week about meeting procedures.

“I put myself out there to try and find a way for you to cooperate and move forward in the normal way that we would,” said Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization. During his statement, Dominguez added that the way negotiations have happened this week should not be repeated again.

The top shipping nations from across the world are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. If the green shipping regulations are adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

“The attempts from the U.S. and others to delay the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework are an affront to multilateralism and fly in the face of the the courage and ambition shown by member states when it was agreed in April. Thankfully this is not a foregone conclusion and countries can continue to demonstrate the spirit of solidarity that they showed in April when voting to adopt the framework,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The regulations set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Observers said it is still unclear what will be decided later today.

“By voting for adoption of the framework, governments will make history with the first global carbon price, and set course for reducing shipping’s global impact on the climate,” said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO. “But failing to support the framework will be a missed opportunity, and risks stagnating action at the IMO for years to come.”",https://www.abccolumbia.com/content/uploads/2025/10/x/j/ap25286586888279-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:11.108675

The IMO’s net-zero proposal, agreed in principle by a majority of member states in April, requires ships with a volume exceeding 5,000 gross tonnes to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity — measured as emissions per unit of fuel — by 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2040, compared to 2008 levels.

Vessels that fail to meet the stricter benchmark would face a $100-per-tonne fee from 2028, while those that fall short of a less demanding target would be charged up to $380 per tonne.

The proposal further sought to establish a carbon credit market, allowing the owners or operators of more efficient vessels to sell credits to those with higher emissions.

After tense negotiations this week, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries to 49. A further 70 nations, including Japan and Greece, abstained from voting.

The Saudi motion was backed by nations including the US, the UAE and China. US President Donald Trump called the levy “a green new tax scam”.

Trump’s administration has previously stated that it would retaliate if any global carbon levy is applied to its ships.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” said ING’s senior economist for transport and logistics, Rico Luman.

“Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome.

“From an economic standpoint, introducing carbon pricing is essential to level the playing field with sustainable fuels, which are currently not economically viable.

The decision was made on Friday, 17 October 2025, during an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which was convened from 14 to 17 October in London to consider draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

The proposal to delay was put forward by Saudi Arabia and supported by Singapore. It passed by a simple majority, with 57 countries voting in favour of the delay, 49 opposing it, and 21 abstaining.

The decision is seen as a setback for countries such as the European Union, Brazil, India, China, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea, which had supported the immediate adoption of the framework. These countries viewed it as a key step towards reducing emissions from global shipping.

In contrast, the United States and Saudi Arabia led efforts to oppose the move, arguing that the measure would place an unfair financial burden on global trade. Both countries are among the world’s largest oil producers.

According to several delegates, Washington exerted diplomatic and economic pressure on other states ahead of the vote. Per reports, the Trump administration had threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on countries supporting the framework, particularly developing and climate-vulnerable nations. Some representatives described this as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”.

U.S. President Donald Trump had publicly urged IMO member states to reject the carbon pricing proposal, calling it a “global green new scam tax on shipping”. He stated on Truth Social that the United States would not comply with such a measure “in any way, shape or form”.

The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) was approved in principle at MEPC 83 in April 2025 as a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention. It sets international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships complying with the IMO’s 2023 GHG reduction strategy.

The framework was initially scheduled to enter into force by March 2027. However, that timeline will now need to be reviewed following the one-year postponement.

During the session, the United States and Saudi Arabia also proposed changing the IMO’s usual “consensus” adoption procedure to an “explicit” process, which would add extra procedural steps and make it harder for some developing countries to adopt the framework later.

Environmental groups expressed concern over the outcome. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at Transport & Environment, said the delay leaves the maritime sector “adrift in uncertainty”.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, in his closing remarks, cautioned delegates not to see the result as a success, saying there were still issues that needed to be addressed before final approval.

Although the extraordinary session has been adjourned for one year, technical work on implementing the framework will continue. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG-20) will meet from 20 to 24 October 2025 to work on guidelines for implementing the framework, including incentive schemes and revenue distribution.

The IMO confirmed that the MEPC will meet again in 12 months to reconsider the proposal and seek wider agreement among its 176 member states.

Global shipping contributes nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions and handles about 90% of world trade. Without a clear emissions plan, experts warn that pollution from the sector could continue to rise.

Washington later warned it might impose penalties, visa restrictions and port charges on countries voting for the plan.

Before the intervention, roughly 60 nations were expected to reaffirm support for the measure. However, delegates instead voted 57–49 to postpone formal adoption, extending negotiations into late next year.

Environmental Targets Set Back

The Net Zero Framework aimed to impose a $380-per-tonne charge on excess emissions while rewarding vessels that used cleaner alternatives.

It aimed to guide the shipping industry toward a 20% emissions cut by 2030. The framework also targeted net zero by 2050.

The International Chamber of Shipping said the delay undermines long-term investment decisions.

Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said the industry needs clarity to make the commitments required to decarbonize.

Several major economies, including China, the European Union, Brazil, and Britain, reaffirmed their support before the vote. This came despite strong objections from Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Yet Argentina and Singapore, both previous supporters, joined the call to defer the measure this time.

Growing Climate Pressure

Shipping, which accounts for nearly three percent of global emissions, is under growing pressure to adopt cleaner energy sources. Alternatives like ammonia and methanol are being explored to replace traditional bunker fuel.

Climate experts warn that the delay could hinder new technological investments in the sector.

They say extreme weather is already disrupting sea routes and endangering maritime safety worldwide.

U.S. President Donald Trump called on IMO member states on Thursday to vote no, saying on his Truth Social platform that Washington would “not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form”.

The Trump administration is looking to take a bigger role in global shipping, and has previously used tariffs as a weapon to extract better terms from Washington’s trade partners

SHIPPING INDUSTRY REACTION

The maritime sector had been expecting a regulatory framework to de-risk and unlock investment in alternative fuels and modern ships.

Danish shipping company Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said the IMO’s decision was a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonise, adding that it will wait to see how the organisation intends to continue the work on the framework.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” said Faig Abbasov, director of shipping with environmental group Transport & Environment.

The IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution.

Climate Impact The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face.","The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Friday, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite US pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry — designed to initially potentially raise over $10 billion a year. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and open the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the US dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “outraged” about.

The European Union, which already incorporated shipping in its carbon market and wants to lead the global effort to put a price on emissions, wasn’t able to muster enough support to push through the tax.

“The decision to reschedule the vote clearly shows European leadership in international climate talks is not enough,” said Poland’s deputy climate minister, Krzysztof Bolesta. “We need others to cooperate and there are not enough of them around.”

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change.

US Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The US strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10% or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the US wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

“Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.

The US also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favor of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Friday, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Tensions between countries grew as the week progressed, and by Friday it became increasingly clear that a vote on adopting the levy was in serious doubt. China, Greece, India and Panama — who all backed the plans in April — either voted to delay the decision, or abstained.

Still, the vote for a one-year delay doesn’t necessarily reflect how a ballot on adopting the charge may have gone, because more countries were allowed to have their say on the delay than would have been on the actual tax.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the US will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than 1% of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

(MENAFN) The United Nations sharply criticized the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) recent decision to delay a critical vote aimed at reducing emissions from the shipping industry, calling it a “missed opportunity” to advance climate action.

At a Friday press briefing, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric stressed the urgency of the issue, stating, ""It's a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear and credible path towards net-zero emissions."" He emphasized the sector’s significant environmental impact, noting, ""The shipping sector, central to our global economy, is responsible for about 3% of global emissions."" He added, ""So, the decarbonization of that sector is critical.""

Pressed on reports that US President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries backing net-zero emission goals, Dujarric responded, ""We've seen reports, this decision to postpone, not to take action, it's not the end of the road, but obviously, the ball has been kicked down the field, quite a bit."" He underlined that the postponement came ""after deliberations"" by IMO member states.

The IMO, a UN agency responsible for global maritime transport regulations, was expected to vote Friday on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a pivotal policy designed to introduce an international levy on shipping emissions. This carbon tax aims to curb shipping’s contribution to global warming, a mounting threat to human life and the planet.

The vote delay followed concerted lobbying by the Trump administration, which pressured countries to resist the emissions-cutting initiative, ultimately stalling progress on this vital climate measure.

The NZF is still alive, but it could just be a case of flogging a dead horse.","Delaying the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has kept it alive, but the question is what will have changed in a year’s time when it comes up for another vote.

During a media briefing following the decision by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez was asked whether it was still alive? To which he replied, “It’s very much still alive”.

Certainly, the delaying a vote on whether or not to adopt NZF by another 12 months saved it from the increasingly likely possibility of being voted against at the end of the fractious four-day extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. However, what there is stop the same scenario being played out in a years’ time, just with even more entrenched opinions, is far from clear.

The NZF amendment to MARPOL was approved at the first extraordinary meeting of the MEPC will remain the same and voting on it has simply been adjourned for a year.

On the positive side as the Secretary General pointed out during the briefing the “silver lining” was, “The framework is still there, and the member states are still talking to each other.”

Asked if the delegations would not simply come back in a years’ time still divided Dominguez said, “I’m working on the objective that yes, there is a division, it was clear on the vote today that the there is more work that needs to be done. I think the negotiations between now and the next meeting will actually help address all that in order to start finding those common areas for us to make progress.”

Intersessional workgroup meetings start next week to work on the guidance to the framework that needs to be developed.

Some organisations representing the shipping industry do see the coming 12 months as a window in which the UN body can work through the difficulties the framework faces and find agreement.

The World Shipping Council (WSC), which represents global liner shipping said the IMO should use additional year to close remaining gaps and ensure an effective global agreement.

There was a similar message from independent tanker owner represented by Intertanko with Managing Director Tim Wilkins saying, “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko members.”

Interntanko said that it would be present at the intersessional workgroup meetings in the coming week to voice the opinions of its members.

However, representative body also noted it was “unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised”.

There has been considerable talk about the pressure applied by the US on smaller member states to not support the NZF which has been described as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”. With US President Donald Trump expressing his “outrage” over the idea of the framework and global carbon tax on shipping this week, there can be little doubt this pressure will continue over the next 12 months, and quite possibly be ramped up.

It is point made from Rico Luman, Senior Economist, Transport & Logistics, at ING, “The delay in the final vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal. It is likely to strengthen opposition, including from the United States, which may view the postponement as a win.”

Indeed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, took social media platform X to hail it as a “HUGE win” for President Trump. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects.”

ING’s Luman believes that time is running out for the NZF. “While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult. Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome,” he said.

The London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations body that governs shipping, voted in April for a global pricing system to help curb greenhouse gases.

But a vote Friday on whether to formally approve the deal was delayed until next year after US President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries backing the plan.

Increased divisions, notably between oil-producing nations and non-oil producers, emerged this week at meetings leading up to Friday’s vote.

Delegates instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to postpone proceedings, which passed by 57 votes to 49.

Trump had said Thursday that the proposed global carbon tax on shipping was a ‘scam’, after the United States withdrew from IMO negotiations in April.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as ‘chaos’ as he addressed the plenary Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Russia had joined major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in voting against the carbon-reduction measure in April, saying it would harm the economy and food security.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, representing 176 member states, said Friday that he hoped there would be no repeat of how the week’s discussions had gone.

‘It doesn’t help your organisation, it doesn’t help yourself,’ he told delegates.

A European Union source told AFP that ‘many countries have changed their minds under pressure from the United States.

A spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called it ‘a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions’.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.

‘Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,’ its Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington’s course on climate change and encouraged fossil fuel use by deregulation.

‘I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,’ Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday.

‘The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,’ he added, telling countries to vote against it.

Washington threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on those supporting the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

Major oil-producer Saudi Arabia also called for Friday’s vote to be postponed.

‘We agree with the United States that it’s important that these conversations are brought to light,’ a Saudi representative said.

Ahead of this week’s London gathering, a majority 63 IMO members that in April voted for the plan had been expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others to formally approve the NZF.

Argentina, which in April abstained from the vote, now opposes the deal.

Leading up to Friday’s decision, China, the EU, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO reaffirmed their support.

The NZF requires ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028 or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

If the global emissions pricing system were adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.
