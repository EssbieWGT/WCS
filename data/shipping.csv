The decision has attracted criticism from environmental and industry groups, including the Clean Shipping Coalition and the International Chamber of Shipping, which had urged the IMO to maintain momentum toward decarbonising the maritime sector.

This disappointment is understandable. The IMO’s strategy to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050 underpins much of the industry’s decarbonisation efforts. Yet, the committee faces significant headwinds ranging from political pressure from the U.S. government, to concerns about market readiness and the need for fair, globally applicable standards. The delay underscores a broader truth: meeting the 2050 net-zero target will require coordinated commitment from governments, shipping companies, cargo owners and consumers alike.

The postponement also comes against a backdrop of deepening geopolitical and economic tensions. Trade disputes among major economies including the United States, China and the European Union have disrupted supply chains through tariffs, reciprocal port fees and shifting global alliances. These developments have forced companies to reconfigure logistics networks, raising operational costs that ultimately trickle down to consumers through higher prices.

In this context, the idea of a global carbon pricing system for shipping does seem increasingly relevant. With the IMO framework on hold, attention is shifting toward the European Union’s Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which requires shipping companies to monitor, report and pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. The EU’s approach may offer a commercial pathway for compliance while keeping pressure on the industry to accelerate decarbonisation.

Meanwhile, the sector continues to advance its fleet modernisation efforts. According to Alphaliner data, as of October 2025, about 72% of new vessel orders are designed to operate on alternative fuels which is a clear shift away from conventional fuel use among larger ships. While this transition helps mitigate environmental and regulatory risks, it also introduces new challenges. Compliance with diverse regional regulations, limited availability of zero-and near-zero-emission fuels, and the need for supporting infrastructure development are all likely to increase costs across the supply chain, adding further inflationary pressures.

Despite these challenges, momentum continues to build. The Getting to Zero Coalition reported more than 60 green shipping corridor initiatives worldwide at the end of 2024, providing testbeds for regulatory, commercial and operational innovation. These initiatives could help create clearer pathways for adopting alternative fuel technologies and achieving net-zero emissions across the maritime sector by 2050.

While the industry has made notable progress through decades of negotiation toward a comprehensive strategic framework, sustained collaboration and policy alignment will be essential, as the environmental and economic costs of inaction far outweigh the challenges of transition. The IMO’s twelve-month pause, therefore, is not merely a setback, rather an opportunity to come together and pave a way forward. The coming year will be crucial for refining the framework, balancing political and commercial realities, and ensuring that the maritime industry, which is responsible for more than 80% of global trade, charts a credible and equitable course toward a net-zero future.",https://www.thedcn.com.au/hubfs/Net%20Zero%202050_Shutterstock_2261424697.png,N,,2025-11-11 05:01:11.642609

Some second-generation air lubrication technologies tackle these questions and challenges but from a fundamentally different approach.
For example, our passive air lubrication system (PALS) generates a fine air-water mixture passively through clever utilisation of vessel motion and hydrodynamic flow.
After twenty years of development, the question is no longer whether air lubrication works in theory, but how it proves its value in practice.
For air lubrication to fulfil its potential, performance claims must be validated independently and across the full operating envelope.","Alex Routledge, CEO of Armada Technologies, writes for Splash today.

Shipping stands at a complex moment in its decarbonisation journey. The IMO’s overall strategy for reaching net zero remains in place, even as the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework has been delayed. In practice, this pause at the global level seems set to be offset by faster-moving regional measures that will increase commercial and compliance pressure on shipowners. Together they create a landscape where the pressure to act is rising, but certainty about what works remains elusive.

In that context, clean technologies occupy a critical but challenging space. They are essential to decarbonisation, yet their credibility rests on proof that they can deliver beyond trials and into day-to-day operation. There is still pressure to act, but any actions must be measured, proven and practical.

For any system claiming to cut fuel use or emissions, what matters most is how it performs in the real world: in different sea states, across varied vessel types, at a range of speeds and on a variety of trades. Without that depth of validation, even promising innovations risk becoming stalled at the pilot stage. The next phase of clean-technology progress will be defined not by how many solutions are available, but by how consistently they deliver under the full range of conditions that define operations at sea.

Nowhere is this tension more visible than in the field of air lubrication. Two decades of development have only produced approximately 600 systems installed or on order worldwide – progress, but not the kind expected of a proven decarbonisation technology. The question is no longer whether air lubrication works in theory, but why it has yet to convince shipowners at scale and in practice.

Shipowners’ perception of air lubrication stems directly from their experience with first-generation systems. Operators have encountered technology that promises much and may deliver satisfactory performance but only in specific, ‘ideal’ conditions. Beyond these narrowly defined parameters, the same complex mechanical systems demand significant power consumption from compressors that erode net savings, add costs and impose maintenance burdens.

These experiences have left shipowners rightly focused on one question above all others: can the technology sustain performance and deliver measurable benefits in every condition that vessels encounter?

Some second-generation air lubrication technologies tackle these questions and challenges but from a fundamentally different approach. Newer systems can eliminate compressors entirely. For example, our passive air lubrication system (PALS) generates a fine air-water mixture passively through clever utilisation of vessel motion and hydrodynamic flow. In doing so, we remove one of the main power consumption vectors for the technology, increasing the net savings potential.

More broadly, the physics behind this results in air lubrication technology that is applicable to a fundamentally wider section of the global fleet, including finer form vessels, vessels operating in challenging weather conditions and at slower speeds where first-generation systems cannot justify their cost and are operationally compromised.

After twenty years of development, the question is no longer whether air lubrication works in theory, but how it proves its value in practice. For air lubrication to fulfil its potential, performance claims must be validated independently and across the full operating envelope. Shipowners are right to expect this level of scrutiny. They should ask what facilities conducted the testing, how results were measured, who validated them, and whether the data represents the complete range of conditions rather than selected highlights.

With this transparency, shipowners and charterers also have the opportunity to reassess currently rigid payback period requirements and, where possible, afford energy efficiency technology (EET) manufacturers more flexibility. Too often, EET makers have been pushed to make the numbers fit narrow project economics, while the split incentive between owners and charterers further complicates investment decisions. Meeting in the middle – with clearer data, realistic ROI expectations, and shared accountability – can be another lever to unlocking meaningful progress on efficiency and emissions.

The air lubrication sector, and the wider clean-technology landscape it sits within, now faces a simple but decisive test: whether transparency becomes the new measure of competitiveness. In this, shipowners have a decisive role to play. Progress will depend on how technologies are chosen, tested and challenged. Every purchasing decision sends a signal: that evidence matters more than claims, that independent validation is a condition of investment, and that the industry will reward those who prove performance across the full spectrum of conditions that ships experience at sea.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/LNG-Generic.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 02:56:10.063732

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations beginning this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry's efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were set to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn't judge the IMO for October's setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given ""how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don't think the IMO stops there, because we don't,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez's opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,"" it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" Forrest said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”

“We help reduce emissions, unlock investment, and enable commercial pathways for maritime electrification at scale,” Mr Glanville said.

From a global perspective, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is advocating and promoting electrification of ports to decarbonise shipping.","PORTS are going beyond being logistics hubs and are increasingly part of efforts to decarbonise infrastructure, Oceon Energy founder Jordan Glanville is to tell the Port Electrification Australia conference in Sydney this week.

Mr Glanville told DCN ahead of the conference that ports could significantly reduce emissions via the use of low carbon or renewable onshore power.

Melbourne-based Oceon is building integrated systems to support this transition, with Electrified Ocean Networks (EONs) to connect vessels, ports and energy markets into a coordinated energy system.

“We help reduce emissions, unlock investment, and enable commercial pathways for maritime electrification at scale,” Mr Glanville said.

Mr Glanville is a naval architect with two decades of experience in the maritime and energy sectors.

Those attending the Port Electrification conference are expected to learn how ports across Australia plan to decarbonise their operations and support their tenants via electrification.

In one example, Port of Brisbane announced earlier this year that its industrial estate had an embedded network to supply 100% renewable power to customers, either through onsite generation, storage, or via a power purchase agreement (PPA).

Mr Glanville told DCN that:

StraitLink has implemented shore power in Melbourne and Burnie.

There are active plans for cruise ship shore power at Glebe Island.

Several other ports have committed to electrifying parts of their own fleets and facilities.

He said major port tenants, tug operators, stevedores and logistics providers have publicly stated decarbonisation goals and are assessing or trialling electrification.

The next step is expected to be turning intent into delivery and developing the infrastructure, energy systems and commercial models.

“Ports can play a critical enabling role as the host sites for these activities,” Mr Glanville said.

Another electrification advocate, Climate Energy Finance (CEF) director Tim Buckley, said it was time for permanent solutions to fossil fuels.

He is speaking to the conference about the work of CEF as an independent research centre, which partners with government and the private sector to accelerate the net zero transition.

From a global perspective, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is advocating and promoting electrification of ports to decarbonise shipping.

The IMO's GreenVoyage2050 program is supporting pilot projects for ferry electrification in countries like Türkiye, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam.

Norway is a global leader in electrifying its harbour ferries, having launched the world's first fully electric ferry, the MF Ampere, in 2015.

Supported by government policy and abundant renewable energy, Norway has rapidly transitioned its ferry fleet to electric or hybrid-electric technology, which significantly reduces emissions and operating costs.

Singapore is also moving in this direction by electrifying harbour craft.

Earlier this year, then chief executive (maritime and ports) at Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Teo Eng Dih, announced a technical reference guide as “a critical step towards developing a safe, robust, and interoperable charging infrastructure for electric harbour craft”.",,N,,2025-11-10 22:00:11.073841

This declaration came amidst recent setbacks where new rules for a carbon fee on shipping were blocked by the United States and Saudi Arabia during a key meeting last month.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO Secretary-General, made these remarks at the United Nations climate negotiations, which are taking place near the Brazilian Amazon. He emphasized the importance of transitioning the shipping industry toward cleaner practices and reducing carbon emissions, despite facing resistance from powerful nations.

During a scheduled vote to adopt a “Net-Zero Framework” aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping fuels, delegates were anticipating a formal approval. The framework would have implemented a marine fuel standard that gradually reduces allowable emissions and established a pricing system, including a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of emissions exceeding set limits. However, after intense lobbying from U.S. officials, particularly during the Trump administration, the decision was postponed for another year, citing the regulations as a “global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The shipping sector is responsible for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that has risen amid increasing trade activities. With large vessels having an operational lifespan of about 25 years, immediate investments and changes are required to achieve significant emissions reductions. The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, has been strong in its advocacy for these regulations.

Despite the hurdles faced, Dominguez expressed optimism about future progress. He stated that the IMO is undeterred and will continue to work towards establishing a fee on carbon emissions to facilitate the industry’s decarbonization. He encouraged collaboration among member states and emphasized a proactive approach to engage all stakeholders essential to this transition.

In a reaction to the setback, Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, acknowledged the disappointment surrounding the delay but urged a rational approach to the situation. He highlighted the importance of maintaining focus on the merits of the regulations and ensuring equitable transitions while collaborating effectively to remove barriers to adoption next year.

During the event, Andrew Forrest, a representative from an Australian green technology firm, asserted that a pollution-free shipping industry is achievable. He claimed that their approach is grounded in pragmatism rather than ideology, signaling a shift away from fossil fuels is both necessary and possible.

Dominguez’s assurances and the continued urgency from various nations reflect a shared goal of addressing the environmental impact of maritime activities and achieving a sustainable future for the shipping industry.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/International-Maritime-Organization-Head-Advocates-for-Fossil-Fuel-Regulation-in.com2F042Fe52Fccdb74ee78d4fc650e9d67e343fb2Fc206320dbda6494eb534.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 21:02:49.577091

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations beginning this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry’s efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were set to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Plan to slash emissions postponed

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn’t judge the IMO for October’s setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given “how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Hopes for future shipping fee remain

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez’s opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,” it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,” Forrest said. “We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totaled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages. Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations’ standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization, voted to postpone for one year a decision that would have helped to set global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

“With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a ‘wait-and-see’ approach now seems the most likely outcome,” said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine’s vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80% of global trade. The industry accounts for about 3% of climate-warming greenhouse gases, a percentage poised to climb without curbs.

Major container shipping lines like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd said they will move forward with efforts to cut carbon emissions from their ships.

More than 70% of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15% for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at 9%, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about 1%, he said.",,N,,2025-11-10 19:56:18.485483

“Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport,” stated Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.
Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at T&E, stated: “The plan clearly acknowledges the important role of e-fuels in decarbonising aviation and shipping.
An eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, launching by year’s end alongside committed Member States, aims to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.","The European Commission launched its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan last week, setting an ambitious roadmap to transform the aviation and waterborne transport sectors through renewable and low-carbon fuels. The plan seeks to mobilize at least €2.9 billion by the end of 2027 to address what officials describe as an urgent need to scale up alternative fuel production.

The stakes are significant. To meet targets established under the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, the EU will need approximately 20 million tonnes of sustainable alternative fuels by 2035, requiring an estimated €100 billion in market investments.

“Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future. It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport,” stated Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The plan’s short-term measures include €2 billion from InvestEU to remove investment barriers, €300 million through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen production supporting sustainable aviation and maritime fuels, and hundreds of millions more through the Innovation Fund for specific fuel projects.

Industry response has been mixed, with stakeholders praising the framework while emphasizing the need for rapid implementation. Jim Corbett, Environmental Director for Europe at the World Shipping Council, called the plan “a promising first step” but stressed that “the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.”

The World Shipping Council pointed to its own research showing the maritime sector alone could uptake 14.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent of renewable fuels by 2035—representing roughly 70 percent of the Commission’s combined target for aviation and maritime—if proper investment conditions materialize. The organization emphasized that over €150 billion has already been invested in dual-fuel ships ready to run on zero or near-zero fuels by 2030, but these investments will only translate into emissions reductions if renewable fuels become competitively priced.

SEA-LNG welcomed the plan’s recognition of methane-based pathways, including LNG, bio-methane and e-methane. Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer at SEA-LNG, noted that “policymakers increasingly recognise the need to balance competitiveness with sustainability and to focus on proven practical and realistic solutions that deliver towards decarbonisation today”.

However, environmental groups warned about timing. Transport & Environment acknowledged promising steps to boost e-fuels production but cautioned that action is needed by 2026. Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at T&E, stated: “The plan clearly acknowledges the important role of e-fuels in decarbonising aviation and shipping. For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels.”

The plan is structured around three pillars: a strategic framework identifying investment needs, financing actions with short and medium-term impact to unlock investments, and an external dimension facilitating global production while ensuring fair competition for EU businesses.

In the medium term, the Commission plans to establish an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments. An eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, launching by year’s end alongside committed Member States, aims to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

The STIP follows the IMO’s October failure to adopt a global carbon pricing system for shipping. Member states postponed the Net-Zero Framework vote to October 2026 due to pressure from the Trump Administration and petro-states. The delay pushes enforcement to decade’s end, leaving the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), combined with the FuelEU Maritime, as the only major carbon-pricing regime for global shipping, reinforcing Europe’s role as de facto climate regulator.

As Europe positions itself to lead the global maritime energy transition, the consensus among industry stakeholders is clear: ambitious targets require equally ambitious and swift implementation to bridge the gap between renewable fuel production capacity and the sector’s decarbonization goals.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-11T050025Z_666471803_RC2G9V9UXH5H_RTRMADP_3_SHIPPING-EMISSIONS-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 18:56:08.626314

“This year’s Europort radiated energy and global connection,” said Raymond Siliakus, Europort Director at Rotterdam Ahoy.","The maritime community came together at Europort 2025, Rotterdam this week to focus minds on the ideas, innovation, and international collaboration needed by an industry that is simultaneously challenged by accelerating energy transition and digitalisation, financial uncertainty and the test of attracting next generation talent.

The successful 42nd edition of Europort concluded following four intense days of conferences, networking, award ceremonies and high-powered panel discussions that assessed how global forces are reshaping the industry and creating new opportunities. Welcoming over 23,000 visitors from 87 countries, the sold-out exhibition featured 1,100 exhibitors and 13 national pavilions.

Europort officially opened on Tuesday 4 November during an energetic Opening Summit that drew parallels between the turbulent 1920s and today, encouraging industry to find creative ways to navigate the challenges of our age. In an inspiring keynote, Marja van Bijsterveldt, Special Envoy for the Dutch Maritime Industry highlighted the power of reinvention, as part of a session which set the tone for the collaboration and innovation that would take centre stage in the week ahead.

In one example, Damen introduced its latest innovation in cargo vessel design – the Combi Freighter CF-5000 ICE: a new, scalable series of ice-class ships. In another, the world’s first ‘Circular Route’ proved a popular addition to proceedings. Featuring 15 maritime companies, the route showcased real-world examples of circularity and its role in promoting sustainable growth.

“Circularity isn’t just good for the planet,” said Marjolein Boer, Founder of the Maritime Sisters and co-organiser of the Circular Route. “It increases our strategic autonomy and creates commercial advantages. By reducing reliance on scarce materials, we lower costs, unlock new business models, and future-proof our industry.”

Sustainability and energy transition remained high on the agenda, despite the pause put on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework at the Marine Environment Protection Committee in October. Discussions at a Maritime Technology Forum (MTF) event ran through a comprehensive set of new guidelines covering risk assessments for alternative fuels. Championing a harmonised and practical approach, the guidelines aim to bridge the gap between safety assurance and decarbonisation.

The importance of collaboration was a recurring theme throughout. During an exhibition visit, Dutch caretaker Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management, Robert Tieman, praised the event’s scale and role in connecting global maritime stakeholders. The Minister also emphasised the role of governments in fostering conditions where businesses can thrive while maintaining focus on sustainability goals.

“We have to keep an eye on our objectives, but also ensure regulations support, rather than hinder, innovation,” Tieman noted, calling for a balanced approach to red tape and a level playing field for all market participants.

Echoing calls for enhanced collaboration, Petra de Groene, Programme Director, Business, Climate, Port and Grid Congestion, Municipality of Rotterdam, commented, “As a crucial hub, the maritime sector is hugely important for Rotterdam – and for future innovation, collaboration is a key element. The city of Rotterdam aims to stimulate cooperation by bringing partners together, including here at Europort where technology companies and other stakeholders can meet.”

On Friday 7 November, the #YoungEuroport events celebrated the next generation and addressed the need to attract talent to the sector. The programme invited students and young professionals to connect with peers and industry leaders, pitch ideas and participate in debates as they explored what the maritime industry has to offer. The final day also concluded the SAFETY4SEA Europort Awards, which recognised organisations and individuals for their outstanding contributions to smarter, greener shipping and nurturing the next generation of maritime professionals.

“This year’s Europort radiated energy and global connection,” said Raymond Siliakus, Europort Director at Rotterdam Ahoy. “In a time of geopolitical tension, it’s inspiring to see so many people from around the world come together to think in opportunities rather than contradictions. That spirit of collaboration is exactly what drives our industry forward.”",,N,,2025-11-10 21:02:56.984544

In a recent interview, Olivi told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, that Trafigura would shift to multiple types of alternatives to conventional, oil-based marine fuels on its decarbonization pathway.
“We are fuel agnostic … we will be kind of playing the fuel mix depending on what regional regulations dictate,” Olivi said.
“The IMO decision delays the implementation of a global framework, but there are still regional frameworks out there.
“A lot of people see it as potentially a very cheap fuel in the years to come,” Olivi said.","Trafigura has envisaged various types of marine fuels in its bunker mix amid a fragmented regulatory landscape, Global Head of Shipping Andrea Olivi said, after the International Maritime Organization failed to adopt a global emissions regulatory framework.

One of the world’s largest trading houses, Trafigura has about 400 tankers, dry bulk carriers and gas carriers on time charters to transport energy and commodity products for its own operations and external clients.

The company has aimed to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity of its shipping operations by 25% by the end of the 2030 financial year (October 2029-September 2030) from a 2019 IMO baseline, with a 23% cut already achieved in FY 2024.

In a recent interview, Olivi told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, that Trafigura would shift to multiple types of alternatives to conventional, oil-based marine fuels on its decarbonization pathway.

“If you ask me to describe the Trafigura fleet in five to seven years’ time, I am sure that we will have dual-fuel LNG vessels, as we will have dual-fuel ammonia vessels and dual-fuel methanol vessels,” the executive said.

Aside from already operating ships capable of running on LNG, LPG, ethane, methanol and biofuels, Trafigura is due to take delivery of four mid-sized gas carriers installed with ammonia propulsion technology from HD Hyundai Mipo in 2028.

“We are fuel agnostic … we will be kind of playing the fuel mix depending on what regional regulations dictate,” Olivi said.

IMO delay

In mid-October, IMO member states voted to delay the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework by a year amid strong US opposition, prompting doubts over whether the UN agency could push ahead with the regulation.

The framework is designed to narrow the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels by placing a cost on maritime GHGs globally from 2028, which many industry participants, including Trafigura, believe would be crucial to accelerate the industry’s low-carbon transition.

September’s monthly average bunker cost for 0.5%-sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $11.19/gigajoule in Rotterdam compared with $45.08/Gj for green ammonia delivered to Northwest Europe on a cargo basis, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab). But ammonia’s premium would shrink by 14% to $29.08/Gj for ships in intra-EU trades when the EU’s Emissions Trading System was taken into account.

“The IMO decision delays the implementation of a global framework, but there are still regional frameworks out there. Think about Europe with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime,” Olivi said. “I think what we will see now in the next six to 12, 18 months is the emergence of more regional measures.”

The EU has extended its ETS to cover maritime transportation since 2024 and introduced the FuelEU rules on marine energy’s GHG intensity from this January, while analysts said the UK, Turkey, some African countries and China might usher in similar regulations.

“[Instead of] a global approach, we will probably see a bilateral or at times multilateral approach between several different countries that agree to apply the same framework,” Olivi said.

“It’s just been delayed from a global point of view. But regionally, I think you will still see a lot of countries implementing new measures going forward.”

Following the IMO delay, Singapore — home to the world’s largest bunker hub — agreed to establish green corridors with China and South Korea that could lead to more use of low-carbon fuels on trade routes between those countries.

“I don’t think we’re stopping. It’s slowing down, and it requires perhaps a small tweak to the strategy, but I think the decarbonization story is still there,” Olivi added.

Fuel choices

In full-year 2024, Trafigura reported 639,923 metric tons of CO2-equivalent of Scope 1 GHGs from its shipping and chartering operations, or nearly 35% of the group total.

The company has planned to power its ammonia-capable gas carriers with low-carbon ammonia for decarbonization, and Olivi stressed its project does not depend on the IMO regulation.

“It doesn’t really affect the investment case, because we were planning to trade the vessels within regions where you already have a framework,” he said.

For conventional ships, Trafigura would turn to biofuels to reduce their carbon footprint while evaluating whether they can be retrofitted to run on alternative fuels at the age of five or 10 years, Olivi added.

While the executive has highlighted ammonia and biofuels as part of Trafigura’s fuel strategy, LNG remains widely viewed as the most commercially viable option in the near term.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for LNG was $14.02/gigajoule in Rotterdam in September, lower than $15.13/Gj for 0.1%-sulfur marine gasoil even when the ETS was not taken into account, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator.

“A lot of people see it as potentially a very cheap fuel in the years to come,” Olivi said. “I think the biggest challenge is the LNG bunkering infrastructure.”

The LNG-capable fleet is projected to grow from 653 ships at the end of 2024 to at least 1,368 by 2028, while the number of LNG refueling barges is expected to rise from 68 to 121, according to DNV’s order book data.",,N,,2025-11-10 18:56:14.954055

Full Conference Call Transcript

Thomas Lister: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, afternoon, or evening to all of you joining us today. I'll pass the call over to George. Global Ship Lease's focus continues to be on optionality. As geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty continue to be a major factor throughout the third quarter.

George Youroukos: As we have seen in recent weeks with the IMO Net Zero framework, USTR, and China port fees, all of which were deferred at the eleventh hour or later, even policies that are proposed without even fully coming into effect are having far-reaching real-world implications. All of these real and potential factors are contributing to two major effects, both of which play to our advantage. Number one, making supply chains less efficient, which means that more ships are needed to transport a given quantity of cargo. Number two, increasing the value of flexible midsize and smaller container ships, such as those in our fleet.

Now, on the IMO deferment, this occurs particularly to the benefit of older conventionally fueled vessels that are now likely to have a longer economic life. Taken together with aggregate growth in global containerized trade, these factors are contributing to a situation where there's essentially zero idle capacity for the vessel size segments in which we operate. Thus, we continue to see strong interest in chartering our vessels, typically on a multiyear basis. Through the first nine months of 2025, we added $778 million in contracted revenues with full contract coverage for the remainder of 2025, 96% coverage for 2026, and 74% coverage for 2027.

This offers us stability and certainty at a time where both are generally in short supply. Our progress in securing additional charter coverage, adding to our revenue backlog, and fortifying our balance sheet has enabled us to achieve strong credit ratings across the board, including an investment-grade rating on our U.S. private placement notes. These same factors, notably including a clutch of recently agreed long-term charters, have put us in a position to once again increase our supplemental dividend, bringing our overall dividend to $2.5 per share on an annualized basis. That's a 19% increase being announced today.

But if you look at where our dividend was just over a year ago, which was $1.50 annualized, the total increase is 67%, all done on a non-speculative basis on the back of real contracted revenues and without compromising our ability to establish a fortress balance sheet and position Global Ship Lease, Inc. for opportunistic fleet renewal at the right time. With everything going on in the world, both Global Ship Lease, Inc. and our customers are acutely aware that many of our assumptions and understandings can be turned upside down one second to the next.

In this environment, we are simultaneously locking in the high value and forward visibility that comes from time charter contracts with top-tier global liners while also making sure that we have the strategic and financial flexibility to respond to the challenges and the opportunities of a fast-changing world and a cyclical industry. In this way, we are maximizing Global Ship Lease, Inc.'s optionality and putting ourselves in the position to protect and generate shareholder value no matter what is waiting around the corner. Now with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas Lister: Thank you, George. Hello again, everyone. And please turn to Slide five to see our diversified charter portfolio. As of September 30, we have over $1.9 billion in forward contracted revenues, with 2.5 years of remaining contract cover. Through the first nine months of 2025, we added 38 charters, including extension options exercised for almost $780 million in contracted revenues, of which about $380 million were added in the third quarter. Slide six is where we discuss our dynamic capital allocation policy. With the inherent cyclicality of our industry, we consider it essential to look at the big picture in order to remain on the front foot, manage risk, and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

As George mentioned, this has only become more important in the current environment. Optionality remains key as we navigate this environment and tackle our priorities. Among other things, these include returning capital to our shareholders through our just upsized $2.5 per share annualized dividend and strengthening our balance sheet. To that end, we've continued to delever to grow equity value and to increase our financial resilience and cash reserves to manage the various geopolitical challenges and uncertainties that confront the industry with growing frequency.

And, of course, we need cash on hand to cover CapEx requirements and to seize the right investment opportunities as and when they arise, especially as we've observed on various occasions because the best such opportunities tend to crop up when capital is otherwise scarce. We're proud to have made Global Ship Lease, Inc. a stable and liquid platform that allows investors to participate in the industry with us managing and mitigating the risks of the down cycle and negative volatility while maximizing access to super returns in the up cycle. Turning to slide seven. This slide shows the cyclicality of our industry and how we have managed it.

We want to emphasize our history of disciplined capital allocation regarding investments, buying ships during downturns where asset prices are depressed, or structuring deals such that downsides are limited and upsides are substantial. This also shows that it is at and near the bottom of cycles where the opportunities for outsized value are to be captured. I'll now pass the call to Tassos to discuss our financials.

Tassos Psaropoulos: Thank you, Tom. Slide eight shows our financial highlights for the first nine months of 2025. I would like to emphasize a few key takeaways. Earnings and cash flow are up compared to the first nine months of 2024. Our cash position is $562 million, of which $72 million is restricted. The remainder ensures that we can fully cover our covenants, work at capital needs, and manage the potential financial implications of geopolitical issues, which seem to be arising with increasing frequency and sharpness. It also provides dry powder both for CapEx to keep our existing fleet commercially relevant and for disciplined investments in fleet renewal if and when the right opportunities emerge.

And, of course, importantly, it supports payment of our expanded dividend. Earlier this year, we completed an $85 million refinancing that pushed our weighted average maturity to 4.7 years and brought our blended cost of debt to 4.34%. We also realized a $28.3 million gain from the sale of three older vessels. Our strong credit ratings were affirmed. We have $33 million remaining under our opportunistic share buyback program, and we continue to delever and build equity value. Slide nine now shows our ongoing process to repeat the resilience, derisk our balance sheet, and grow equity value. The graph on the left shows our progress in reducing our outstanding debt.

From $950 million at the end of 2022, we are on track to be under $700 million at the end of this year, even as we have acquired ships and put leverage on. The graph on the right is the more telling perspective as our financial leverage has reached 2.5 times. We have come a long way since the days of eight-plus times leverage. Slide 10, the left graph shows our cost of debt, which we have lowered to a blended 4.34%, down from over 6% in 2020. We have continually reduced our margin even as soft has risen materially.

And the graph on the right shows our very competitive breakeven rates where interest rate reductions have more or less offset OpEx inflation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom to discuss the market and our fleet. Thanks, Tassos.

Thomas Lister: Slide 11 reiterates our emphasis on midsize and smaller container ships between 2,010 TEU. These vessels are the backbone of global trade, and not dependent upon any one trade or country, and are extremely flexible. This stands in contrast to the very big ships that tend to dominate the headlines in the media but which are more restricted in where they can go due to their size requiring specialized port infrastructure and deepwater, not to mention huge cargo volumes to fill them. This keeps the very big ships largely confined to the main lane trades between China and the U.S. or Northern Europe, which as I'll get to in a minute, have been disrupted in recent quarters.

The flexibility our fleet offers is a key point that we reiterate because it matters a great deal, particularly in this current environment of heightened uncertainty and shifting trade patterns. Our fleet plays an increasingly vital role as trade routes and supply chains have become fragmented by a wide variety of factors that we'll discuss on the coming slides. On Slide 12, we break down the impact we've seen from the ongoing disruption in the Red Sea, prior to which approximately 20% of global containerized trade volumes transited that bottleneck.

Since then, about 10% of effective capacity has been absorbed as ships have been forced to reroute around the Cape Of Good Hope, which in turn has driven up charter rates. While it is difficult to predict how long these particular conditions will last, we and the industry more broadly are looking to see a sustained period of safety and stability before transiting goods through there again, as seafarer safety is key. If and when the Red Sea does reopen for safe transit, there would be a period of costly and complex rerouting and reshaping of networks for the liner companies.

This suggests that there will need to be a reasonably high industry-wide comfort level before we would expect to see large-scale rerouting via the Red Sea and Suez. But it's certainly something to keep an eye on. On Slide 13, we discuss tariffs and how 2019 under the first Trump administration could be instructive in how we might expect things to continue to play out moving forward. Following the 2019 tariffs, there was reduced trade between the U.S. and China, which had a negative impact on larger containerships used for those mainland trades. While as for midsized and smaller container ships, there was, perhaps counterintuitively, an uplift in demand following the tariffs.

As trade routes shifted and more emphasis was placed on intra-Asian trades where midsized and smaller ships predominate. Regional trade volumes increased, the supply chain diversified, and midsized and smaller containerships were the beneficiaries. Put bluntly, if you're providing capacity to the containerized supply chain as we are, increased disruption, complexity, and inefficiency in the supply chain tends to be a good thing and supportive of earnings. Slide 14 is where we discuss the latest developments or non-developments, if you prefer, on the regulatory front. Namely, USTR Fees and the Reciprocal China port fees caused quite a lot of agitation, vessel redeployments, and uncertainty as the industry sorted out how to adjust.

In the case of USTR, that played out with several months of forward notice, as the regulations which were announced in February modified in April and implemented in October. Meanwhile, in the China port fee situation, several months' worth of disruption and strategizing were forced into a memorable few days in October with measures announced on a Friday and implemented the following Tuesday. Even with both measures now apparently suspended after only negligible periods of enforcement, the industry was given yet another sharp reminder of the value of maintaining flexibility. Meanwhile, the long-anticipated net zero framework at the IMO, which had been due to be adopted in October, was deferred at the eleventh hour by one year.

This deferral will likely extend the lives of older ships and lift the commercial relevance and earnings for conventionally fueled ships such as those in the Global Ship Lease, Inc. fleet. Our view has long been that in a period of pronounced regulatory uncertainty, there are clear advantages to investing in midlife tonnage and being smart followers when it comes to the adoption of new fuels and propulsion technologies. We cover supply-side dynamics and scrapping trends on Slide 15. As ships continue to transit around the Cape Of Good Hope, and supply chains remain both fragmented and subject to continuous reshuffling, idle capacity and scrapping levels have remained close to zero. In that context, scarcity value is real.

And the liners continue to show an interest and, in fact, a need to charter in scarce tonnage in an uncertain freight environment as the risk of being short on capacity and the value of network optionality override concerns about fleet optimization and the maximization of efficiency. Slide 16 shows the order book. Here, we want to highlight that although the overall order book is meaningful and has grown over the past few years, the segments in which Global Ship Lease, Inc. focused are seeing far less growth. For ships over 10,000 TEU, a segment upon which Global Ship Lease, Inc. does not focus or participate, the order book to fleet ratio stands at 54%.

However, this stands in sharp contrast to the 32% ratio for all containerships and even more so for the 15% order book to fleet ratio in the segments Global Ship Lease, Inc. does participate in, which are those between 2,010 TEU. Also, with the current order book, if we were to assume that all vessels over 25 years old were scrapped through 2029, which is how long it would take to deliver the current order book, the sub-ten thousand TEU fleet would actually shrink by over 5% in that time frame. While capacity remains tight, we will continue to lock in charter coverage at attractive rates.

However, should the market normalize in the coming years, we would expect to see scrapping activity pick up sharply, meaningfully offsetting the impact of new vessels coming into the market in our size segments. Slide 17 shows the charter market against which I would remind you that our breakeven rate, including operating costs and debt service, is just over $9,100 per vessel per day. With the current market conditions, we have been locking in as much charter coverage as possible and now have forward visibility on €1.92 billion of contracted revenues over 2.5 years of coverage.

Who knows how macro, geopolitical, and industry dynamics will develop going forward, but we're pleased to have built a stable platform in otherwise choppy seas. On that note, I will turn the call back to George on slide 18.

George Youroukos: Thank you, Tom. To summarize, our cash flows are strong, and we continue to build our charter backlog. With almost $2 billion of cover over two and a half years, 2025 fully contracted, marginal open days in 2026, and a significant slice of 2027 already covered. Even as there is a sigh of relief on the current suspension of USTR and China port fees, and some quarters for a deferral of the IMO net zero framework, uncertainty remains pronounced. We're maximizing optionality to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities. Less efficient and more fragmented supply chains are increasing demand for our fleet of flexible midsize and smaller container ships.

We have strengthened our balance sheet and continue to amortize debt to build equity value and resilience through delevering. We have lowered our financial leverage, and our average break-even rates stand at just above $9,500 per day per vessel. And our credit ratings are in great shape. As the existing cash flows and cash cows begin to age out, we're focused on the disciplined and opportunistic renewal of our fleet to ensure that we have the right value-generating assets going forward. And as ever, we're proud of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend, which following the increase announced today stands at an annualized rate of $2.5 per common share, 67% above where it was just eighteen months ago.

With that, we would be very pleased to take your questions.

Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.

Liam Dalton Burke: Thank you. Hi, George, Tom, Tassos. How are you today?

George Youroukos: We're well. Thanks, Liam. How are you?

Liam Dalton Burke: Fine. Thank you. It looks like freight rates have sort of bounced off the bottom from the third quarter and are inching up. Are you still seeing a healthy gap between freight rates and charter rates here?

Thomas Lister: Hi, Liam. Short answer, yes. Charter rates continue to move sideways at very healthy levels. So historically, I would say, really quite high and attractive levels. So despite the near-term volatility both up and down in the freight markets, the charter markets are staying steady.

Liam Dalton Burke: Great. And is there any appetite or how are you balancing rates versus duration when you're looking at either renewals or forward charters?

Thomas Lister: Look. We're conscious that these are strange and uncertain times. So, we continue to be focused on a sort of risk-averse basis on midterm and longer charters. And we're happy to take attractive economic rates on as long charters really as we're able to go at the moment. So for different sizes, that means probably sub 5,000 TEU. You're looking at a couple of years that you can fix for. And from, say, six or six and a half thousand TEU up, you're looking at maybe three and possibly even four years in some instances. And that would be our preference to lean into.

Liam Dalton Burke: Great. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, George.

George Youroukos: Our pleasure.

Operator: Again, to ask a question, simply press 1. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Nokta. Thank you.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Hi, George, Tom, Tassos. Thanks for the update. Obviously, things are coming together quite nicely. Pretty solid quarter. You added a good amount of backlog despite all the uncertainty and the strange times that you're just referencing, Tom. Just kind of thinking about the fact that you were able to add so much backlog in the third quarter, $380 million, nearly half of what you did for or sorry, nearly half equal to what you did in the first half. Just want to get a sense from you. Is that on the back of a very sort of maybe active, fast-paced market on the part of charters?

Or is it something unique to Global Ship Lease, Inc. that you were able to accomplish, maybe not necessarily representative of the broader market dynamics?

Thomas Lister: I mean, obviously, we'd take every opportunity to talk up our own book, Omar, but I would say that it's more representative of the market. And if you look back on 2025 year to date, the first quarter was very active. The second quarter was significantly disrupted by Liberation Day. So I would say a lot of chartering activity was effectively put on hold during the second quarter. And that came into the third quarter. So I think probably best to look back on the nine months as a whole as opposed to trying to read too much into individual quarters.

But what I would say is that, in the face of an uncertain environment, and it just seems to get more uncertain every day, the lines see capacity as optionality. Particularly, you know, midsize and smaller container ships that can be moved around pretty much any trade. And we see, as a result, sustained demand for such tonnage, which is what explains the fact that charter rates in the broader market as well as within our fixtures remain at very attractive levels.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Especially, it looks like, you know, for those older vessels we noticed in your fleet list, several of those ships that are in that 2,000, 2,001 built age range have now been extended for, say, three years. You know, those ships are going to be, call it, close to twenty-nine, maybe thirty years when those ships roll off charter. You think obviously, it's going to be a different market perhaps in three years' time, but as you think about what that market looks like, assuming it's still kind of the same, do you think their ships can continue to trade at twenty-nine, 30 years old, or is there an age limit you think for those ships?

George Youroukos: Yep. If I may take this, I will tell you. If the market was exactly the same as it was today, these ships will continue to trade. There's one big differentiation between containers and the other types of ships. There is no extra insurance on the cargo depending on the age of the ship. And why is that? Because container ships have the highest and best record of safety versus other types of ships. I mean, ships sinking or breaking into two, etcetera. The construction of the containers, because of the way they are loaded and discharged, in a direct way. You know, they have to slide the containers into the cargo hold from the gantry crane.

They are super heavy in lightweight, hence, very strong, very well made. Then the fact that the cargo does not come into contact with the cargo hold, meaning it's just boxes that you stack up in, so you're not putting anything like oil that goes and touches the side of the ship, you know, the cargo hold or bulk cargo, which, again, you know, gets in contact with the surface of the cargo hold and deteriorates over time. Make container ships very strong, and hence, there is no extra insurance, which means that the ships can trade easily past the twenty-eight or twenty-nine years if the market is there.

Thomas Lister: And, Omar, just to sort of add yet more texture to that. I think, you know, the US Jones Act vessels that trade, in some instances into the sort of late thirties and occasionally into their forties, are evidence of the fact that technical obsolescence in the containership sector, if you put sort of fuel and propulsion issues to one side for a moment, is not an issue. So that dovetails with what George was just saying. So long story short, if there's economic need, the vessels will, quote unquote, live longer.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, George. That's very helpful. And then maybe just as one final one, Tom, you were talking about the Red Sea. And there's obviously perhaps maybe a growing view that we'll start to see transit pick up again in the near future now that there's a peace deal in Gaza. Still, obviously, a lot of uncertainty there. But, just want to get a sense from you. Are you having discussions with your charters at the moment on how that will look? And is that how does that decision come about? Is that going to be an agreement that you make, or is it going to be them who force it down?

How do you kind of think about the two sides of the ship?

Thomas Lister: Yeah. So first of all, no. It's not something which is currently under discussion. Secondly, it's a sort of multilateral decision that has to be taken because also beyond the charterers and the owners, there are also the insurers, not only of the vessels themselves but of the cargo. So it's a fairly complex web of folk that have to get comfortable with the idea of transiting. And the biggest concern is obviously that of seafarer safety.

But I would say, if we go back to looking at the tonnage that was diverted away from the Red Sea and Suez and around the Cape Of Good Hope, it's predominantly the bigger ships, the larger ships, because it's those ships that are typically deployed on the Asia to Europe legs.

So I would say that the opening or not of the Red Sea is something that will have a proportionally greater impact on bigger ships and less of an impact, which is not to say no impact for sure, but less of an impact on midsize and smaller ships which were not frequent transiters of the Red Sea and Suez in any case, even when, you know, it was a normal environment, up until 2023. So we'll have to see, but I think the dynamics remain comparatively supportive.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Great. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, George. I'll pass it back.

George Youroukos: Our pleasure.

Operator: And with no further questions in queue, I will now hand the call back over to Thomas Lister for closing remarks.

This dual focus on two high-growth, high-margin markets strengthens HyOrc’s positioning as it advances toward its OTCQB uplisting and ongoing SEC reporting process, offering investors exposure to scalable clean-energy growth.

The collaboration will focus initially on a California-based pilot project, where the partners plan to engage with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and other agencies for grant support. The program aims to demonstrate HyOrc’s patented external-combustion powertrain, a zero-emission, multi-fuel system that can operate on hydrogen, natural gas, or renewable fuels - offering freight operators a cost-effective path to decarbonization.

This partnership targets the U.S. freight rail market, which is valued at an estimated $71.8 billion (2025). The sector is under increasing regulatory and competitive pressure to transition its fleet, creating a significant, mandated growth opportunity for zero-emission powertrain retrofits.

""This partnership marks HyOrc’s entry into the North American rail market,” said Andrea Magalini, President of HyOrc. ""Zeltech’s rail expertise and our proven powertrain technology create a strong foundation for clean, scalable freight transport.”

In parallel, HyOrc is advancing its green methanol project in Portugal, based on its proprietary waste-to-methanol technology that converts municipal solid waste into clean fuel. The Portugal facility is expected to include an offtake agreement with a rated international buyer, which is the final step required to enable project financing and deliver long-term, guaranteed revenue visibility. As global shipping transitions to methanol to meet IMO 2030 targets, HyOrc’s projects position the company to serve one of the world’s fastest-growing clean-fuel markets.

Unlike technologies reliant on subsidies, HyOrc’s projects are underpinned by guaranteed demand and contract-based revenues - including methanol sales through long-term offtakes and locomotive retrofits financed directly by freight operators.

""Our technology is validated, audit complete, and SEC reporting transition underway,” added Magalini. ""HyOrc is now focused on disciplined execution and value creation through real, revenue-generating assets.”

There has also been a shift in consumer consciousness surrounding travel-related carbon emissions, which is why cruise and ferry operators are spending millions equipping their fleets with the latest energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.

These projects include installing equipment such as shore power capability, energy storage and advanced wastewater treatment systems, as well as integrating renewable energy sources (such as solar panels) onboard. Shipowners are also converting engines to run on alternative fuels, including renewable biodiesel, LNG and green methanol, and coating hulls with anti-fouling paints to reduce drag as ships sail through the water. Drydock projects of this kind are certain to increase in number as the evidence to support the effectiveness of decarbonisation technologies grows.

However, these aren’t the only types of upgrade projects taking place at shipyards across the globe. Cruise and ferry brands are also carrying out regular maintenance and refurbishment work on their existing vessels to ensure they offer the same brand standards and high-quality experiences as their newer ships.

With much to do to decarbonise and modernise the existing fleet of ships, repair and refurbishment shipyards around the globe have, so far, had a busy 2025.

Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven, Germany

Ambassador Cruise Line’s Renaissance spent a month in drydock in early 2025 where it was rebranded from former operator Compagnie Française de Croisières, as part of the company’s merger with Ambassador(which has formed the Ambassador Group). The ship also received a number of modernisations, including the retrofitting of a selective catalytic reactor exhaust gas treatment system for emission reduction. The team also used ultra-high-pressure washing to remove damaged areas on the underwater hull before applying a silicone coating on the propellers. Preparations were also made for the installation of a shore power system.

Three Finnlines ro-pax vessels – sister ships Finnstar, Finnlady and Finnmaid – received numerous upgrades during a drydock in spring 2025. The refurbishment focused on enhancing the cafe and lounge areas with new seating, carpets and colour palette. The team also upgraded the exterior deck on the vessels, which operate on the route between Helsinki, Finland, and Travemünde, Germany.

A&P Falmouth, UK

Saga Cruises’ vessel Spirit of Discovery drydocked at A&P Falmouth in June 2025, following a successful project onboard sister ship Spirit of Adventure in 2024. The two-week drydock was for scheduled maintenance, including hull painting to increase fuel efficiency, as well as a five-year overhaul of the vessel’s two propulsion pods and the bow thrusters. All the ship’s lifeboats and tenders were also serviced and repaired as necessary.

Navantia, Cadiz, Spain

Navantia has refurbishment and repair projects for 13 cruise vessels on its books for 2025, six of which have already been completed. This includes Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Miracle and Carnival Valor, and Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas and Allure of the Seas.

The 15-year-old Allure of the Seas underwent a $100 million renovation as part of the cruise line’s Royal Amplified programme and now includes many of the standout features found onboard Royal Caribbean’s newbuild vessels, Icon of the Seas and Utopia of the Seas. On decks five to 17 a team of 150 Bolidt technicians carried out resurfacing of the 4,000-square-metre pool deck using Bolideck Future Teak. The team also refurbished the ship’s 1,950-metre jogging track, sun deck, and 115 balconies, as well as installing soundproofing for a new 800-square-metre extension to the solarium on deck 15.

Meanwhile ship design and engineering company Foreship supported the installation of Ultimate Abyss, a 10-storey dry slide at the aft of the vessel. The company also designed a new steel structure in the forward part of the ship to accommodate additional cabins.

In April 2025, Royal Caribbean International strengthened its relationship with Navantia by signing a strategic framework agreement for future ship modernisation and revitalisation projects. The partnership dates back to 2012 when the Spanish shipyard successfully revitalised two Royal Caribbean ships in Cádiz; since then, Navantia has modernised 45 of the cruise operator’s vessels.

Astilleros de Santander, Spain

HX (Hurtigruten Expeditions) cruise shipSpitsbergen spent February and March 2025 in drydock as part of the expedition cruise line’s €7 million ($8.2 million) renovation programme, which also included sister ship Fram. The latter was refurbished in April 2025 at Astibal Shipyard in Panama.

The ship’s newly built science centre, located on deck six, features interactive screens, flexible lecture space, a small library and dedicated workstations for citizen science activities. The space is also equipped with interpreter systems for multi-language talks to ensure accessibility for international guests.

The project onboard the 150-guest ship also included updated guest spaces and refreshed exteriors with the brand’s indigo blue and sand livery, while crew areas, including cabin bathrooms and dining facilities, were also refurbished.

Technical and interior design upgrades were made to several public areas, which also received new furniture. A new Effy jewellery retail space was created, and the ship’s casino was expanded. More than 20,000 square metres of new carpet were installed in all suites, veranda staterooms and public areas, including the atrium, photo gallery and studio, Rolling Stone Lounge, and Greenhouse Spa & Salon. The Rolling Stone Lounge now features an enhanced bar and new carpet, furnishings, LED lighting and flooring. Selected cabin bathrooms were also fully renovated, while the Sea View and Lido pools received fresh teak decking.

Damen Shiprepair Rotterdam, Netherlands

At the end of April 2025, Damen Shiprepair Rotterdam replaced a 92-ton engine block on Princess Cruises’ 330-metre Regal Princess – a process that is rarely done more than once a decade. The job began mid-voyage, with components stripped while 3,000 guests were still onboard. To extract the engine, parts of the hull and bulkhead were removed, then the block was slid out using skidding beams and a crane. Despite the short lead time and tight drydocking window, the project was completed safely and on schedule by the Damen team.

Importantly, the prototype also demonstrates how DAC technology can be integrated with existing infrastructure and renewable energy sources, accelerating the decarbonisation of transport and logistics hubs.
Without investments in DAC and related technologies, Malaysia may struggle to close the carbon gap and meet its 2050 targets.
Conclusion Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate.
Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey.","NOVEMBER 10 — Global warming driven primarily by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO₂) continues to pose one of the most urgent environmental threats of our time. CO₂, the largest contributor, traps heat in the atmosphere, disrupting weather patterns, raising sea levels, and impacting ecosystems and public health globally. Emitted mainly through the burning of fossil fuels for power, transportation, and industrial processes, CO₂ also stems from deforestation, which reduces Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon naturally.

As Malaysia pursues its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the government and key stakeholders are accelerating efforts to integrate transformative technologies into national climate policy. One such technology under active consideration is Direct Air Capture (DAC), a process that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. While Malaysia has advanced its climate agenda through renewable energy, electrification, and sustainable biofuels, these approaches can only reduce emissions by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. To reach full decarbonisation, carbon removal technologies like DAC are essential.

In a major step forward, Malaysia is initiating a multinational collaboration involving local universities, key logistics hubs, a leading Japanese university, and top-tier Japanese firms specialising in climate innovation, green fuels, and carbon capture. This cross-border initiative will pilot a mini DAC prototype system aimed at reducing emissions in high-concentration areas such as international airports and seaports.

Strategic deployment at high-emission zones

Malaysia’s logistics sector including aviation, maritime shipping, and associated ground transport contributes significantly to the country’s carbon footprint. Despite progress in adopting cleaner fuels and efficiency upgrades, emissions remain high due to the sector’s energy-intensive nature. To tackle this challenge, stakeholders are evaluating pilot DAC deployments at strategic sites, with a focus on Malaysia’s busiest international airports and major seaports.

Following initial engagements, private company in Malaysia has agreed to support a pilot project aligning with its sustainability agenda. A virtual agreement has earmarked a location near the aircraft hangar and close to flight take-off zones, an area with nearly a thousand aircraft movements daily as the optimal site for DAC deployment. This placement ensures the prototype unit is exposed to high CO₂ concentrations, maximising its operational effectiveness.

A mini-DAC prototype will capture approximately one kilogram of CO₂ per day, serving as a live demonstration of the technology’s performance under Malaysia’s tropical climate. The captured gas will then be released using waste heat from airport infrastructure, and subsequently liquefied for potential commercial use or conversion into green fuels.

This small-scale deployment will serve multiple purposes: testing energy efficiency, validating environmental performance, and collecting operational data to inform future scale-up.

Importantly, the prototype also demonstrates how DAC technology can be integrated with existing infrastructure and renewable energy sources, accelerating the decarbonisation of transport and logistics hubs.

Economic and policy implications

The initiative is particularly timely as Malaysia prepares to introduce carbon pricing mechanisms, including a national carbon tax expected in 2026. DAC technologies offer not only environmental benefits but also economic opportunities such as generating carbon credits, stimulating green technology industries, and enabling compliance with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.

The project will also explore commercialisation avenues for the captured CO₂. These include use in synthetic fuels for electricity generation, and other applications in chemicals and advanced materials. Such innovations support the vision of a circular carbon economy, where CO₂ is recycled as a resource rather than treated as waste.

Malaysia’s involvement in DAC development supports global decarbonisation targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). It also complements the country’s own National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and recent government initiatives, including a 1 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate starting in 2027. Hence, DAC will be critical to neutralise residual carbon, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping.

The collaboration also fosters a long-term platform for international research, talent development, and policy innovation. Joint efforts with Japanese university and companies will generate technical knowledge, strengthen Malaysia’s green engineering workforce, and contribute to the development of national guidelines for carbon capture infrastructure.

Our opportunity to lead in South-east Asia

Globally, countries such as Japan and the European Union are already investing in DAC technologies. For Malaysia to realise its ambition of becoming a green technology hub in Asean, it must adopt a proactive policy stance on carbon removal. Incentivising R&D partnerships, supporting pilot programs, and fostering public-private collaboration are key to positioning the nation as a regional leader in climate action.

Without investments in DAC and related technologies, Malaysia may struggle to close the carbon gap and meet its 2050 targets. However, by leveraging its ports, airports, and existing infrastructure especially with access to recycled heat and solar energy the country can create cost-effective DAC solutions suited to local conditions.

Conclusion

Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate. Until now, DAC systems which remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere have only been trialled in temperate regions, where seasonal changes influence performance. This new study will evaluate how the technology functions in consistently warm, humid conditions typical of South-east Asia. If successful, the findings could pave the way for wider deployment of DAC across Asean countries and other tropical regions, contributing to global efforts to address climate change.

Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey. The pilot DAC project offers not just a path to emissions reduction, but a blueprint for integrating science, industry, and policy into a unified strategy for climate resilience.

“The Orca class represents a new era in heavy-lift shipping, combining advanced technology with a strong focus on efficiency and sustainability,” said SAL Heavy Lift managing director Sebastian Westphal. “These vessels are equipped to establish a new benchmark for safety, precision and innovation in this highly specialised shipping sector.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/SAL_heavy_lift_Orca_class_MEOH_ready_vessel_Elise11_Thumb.png,N,,2025-11-10 07:16:46.844805

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high.
As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.
“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow.
Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised.","European shipping emissions surged last year to their ‘highest’ level since official monitoring began back in 2018, fresh data published by the EU’s Transport & Environment (T&E) shows.

According to the EU MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) system, which measures emissions from ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at European ports, 2024 set a brand-new record with emissions jumping by 13% despite trade volumes remaining flat.

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high. As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.

T&E has also highlighted that the level of transported liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been ballooning since Russia invaded Ukraine, even though data does show a decrease in 2024. On the other hand, emissions from moving crude oil have risen to 2019 highs.

“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow. Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised. Efficiency and green hydrogen-based fuels will be needed to get to zero,” Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, commented.

It is worth noting that the EU has been pushing forward with plans to minimize dependence on fossil fuels and boost investment in clean fuel alternatives, more so since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Just recently, the commission officially adopted the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) to increase investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the maritime as well as aviation sector(s). One of the key measures of the plan aims to mobilize up to €2.9 billion for alternative energy sources.

Officials from T&E have further underscored that disruptions in the Red Sea, in particular, have pushed vessels (specifically and by the largest number containerships) to re-route onto longer journeys around the Cape of Good Hope, causing them to sail faster to maintain delivery schedules.

In essence, per the MRV data, operational pressures born out of the Red Sea crisis resulted in more emissions per boxship, a segment that was reportedly the main driver of increased pollution, recording a 46% increase.

As informed, this can potentially be explained by an 18% increase in average distance sailed, a 3% average growth in operational speeds, and an increase in the number of units needed to service longer trade routes.

To add to this, shipping emissions—especially in the EU, which is believed to control around 35% of the worldwide fleet—are “very sensitive” to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Among the biggest polluters in the maritime transport industry are some of its largest players. Switzerland’s Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) remains the most polluting company in the EU, T&E’s report suggested, having been responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Beyond the container lines, Italy’s Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

“Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial,” Peigney remarked.

As disclosed, the Emissions Trading System (ETS) for shipping has been in place for nearly two years. So far, it has proven ‘effective’, with around 99% compliance reported in the first year.

The upcoming review, therefore, could be the ‘perfect chance’ for the EU to maintain its course on maritime climate regulation by ‘bolstering’ and extending the system to make sure all polluters “pay their fair share”, T&E concluded.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/Industrys-first-Maersk-ready-to-convert-existing-containership-to-methanol-dual-fuel-engine-next-year1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1687333112,N,,2025-11-10 07:16:51.292915

COSCO SHIPPING and China Classification Society (CCS) jointly hosted a high-level forum on September 16 at the London International Shipping Week 2025 (LISW25). The event, themed “Green and Smart Solutions for a Safe, Sustainable and Efficient Shipping Industry,” showcased the Chinese shipping industry’s latest technologies and practical achievements in green and smart development, underscoring its global vision in advancing the “dual transformation” of digital intelligence and green low-carbon operations.

Mr. Zhu Bixin, Director of the Board and President of COSCO SHIPPING, attended LISW and delivered a keynote speech. He affirmed COSCO SHIPPING’s commitment to integrating ESG principles into its global operations and providing customers with safe, efficient, and sustainable services.

Global Initiatives for Sustainable Shipping

Mr. Zhu Bixin proposed three key initiatives for the sustainable development of the global shipping industry:

Promoting Regulatory Uniformity: Firmly supporting the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) net-zero framework to establish a fair, efficient, clear, and definitive regulatory environment for the industry’s green transformation.

Increasing Green Energy Investment: Proposing the joint establishment of a dedicated fund for green shipping energy, supporting cross-border demonstration projects, and overcoming energy supply bottlenecks to accelerate large-scale application of green fuels. Over one-third of COSCO SHIPPING’s new vessels are already powered by new energy fuels, and the company has already launched a green shipping energy fund.

Advancing Digital Green Transition: Calling for the creation of a blockchain-based carbon footprint certification platform to cover the entire lifecycle of green fuels, ensuring data immutability, traceability, and auditability from production to combustion. The existing GSBN platform, under COSCO SHIPPING, is prepared to collaborate with international institutions to standardize global green certification data.

Technological Advancements and UK Highlights

The forum featured in-depth discussions among representatives from international maritime regulatory authorities, industry organizations, and leading enterprises. COSCO SHIPPING presented an integrated “shipping + port + logistics” green and smart supply chain solution, noting that its operational efficiency has been enhanced through the application of blockchain and AI technologies. CCS showcased its developments, including the formulation of over 30 green and digital ship standards and the establishment of a zero-carbon shipping innovation laboratory.

During the event, COSCO SHIPPING (UK) released its ESG Highlights, detailing localized efforts such as the green smart flagship warehouse project by Crystal Logistics at the Freeport of London Gateway Port. This facility achieved a 40% reduction in carbon emissions and earned a BREEAM “Outstanding” rating through photovoltaic power generation and intelligent systems. Furthermore, its subsidiary, Multimodal Logistics Ltd (MML), is advancing fleet electrification and smart fleet management, achieving an energy efficiency improvement of approximately 8%.

Industry insiders expressed plans for China and Europe to strengthen cooperation in green fuel R&D, intelligent vessel demonstration, and carbon footprint certification, with the first cooperation outcomes planned for announcement at MARINTEC CHINA 2026.",https://logistics-manager.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1600x1034-mv-cosco-shipping-aries.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 07:16:56.437741

AXSMarine data shows that from January to October this year, global ship orders by gross tonnage (GT) totaled 78 million, down from 113 million during the same period last year.

Order volume surged to a 17-year high in 2024 as ships changed course to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, meaning longer voyages required more ships to maintain transport schedules.

Meanwhile, shipping companies are also preparing for the new environmental regulations soon to be introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

AXSMarine data indicates that orders for alternative fuel ships totaled approximately 29 million GT in the first ten months of this year, down from 42 million GT during the same period last year.

However, uncertainty in the shipping market surged again in October: Under pressure from representatives of the United States and Saudi Arabia among IMO member states, the organization voted to postpone the implementation of a controversial resolution for one year. This resolution would have pushed for the establishment of unreasonable global carbon reduction targets and introduced a system of penalties or incentives for compliance with these targets.

AXSMarine personnel stated: “With the IMO net-zero framework vote postponed, the future order market is most likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach. From January to October this year, over 70% of new vessels ordered by container ship and car carrier owners featured alternative fuel capabilities, while bulk carriers and tankers accounted for only 10-15%.”

LNG continues to dominate among alternative fuels, accounting for 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol represents 9%, while ammonia and other fuels collectively make up approximately 1%.

AXSMarine data indicates that methanol’s prominence in container shipping has significantly waned—its share of new orders has plummeted from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, with fuel supply and costs remaining the primary challenges.",https://www.imarinenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110151345456.png,N,,2025-11-10 07:17:15.309850

The Busan Port Authority (BPA), the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA), the Port of Tacoma (PoT), the Port of Seattle (PoS) and the Ulsan Port Authority (UPA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (Mou) on 5 November, according to Pacific Environment on Thursday (6 November).

Under the MoU, both agree to strengthen cooperation on green shipping corridors, decarbonise maritime shipping and accelerate the adoption of clean marine fuels.

“Pacific Environment applauds the commitment to continuing collaboration between the state of Washington’s ports and Korea,” said Fern Uennatornwaranggoon, Climate Campaign Ports Director at Pacific Environment.

“Electrifying ports and moving ships to zero-emissions reduces the health risks of air pollution for portside communities and port workers. We applaud the ports’ action to protect communities and port workers from toxic pollution and climate change impacts.”

For nearly three years, the NWSA has been working partners on the US-Korea Green Shipping Corridors Project, the goal of which is to study the feasibility of accelerating the transition to zero or net-zero (ZNZ) marine fuels in the trade lanes between the NWSA gateway and the Korean ports of Ulsan and Busan.

The studies are exploring: projected demand for ZNZ fuels; emerging ZNZ fuel supply chains on both ends of the trade lanes and globally; ZNZ fuel storage and bunkering capacities (current and potential future); safety and other regulatory frameworks; and ZNZ costs – including an assessment of the “total cost of ownership” of ZNZ fuels, the estimated price differential compared to existing fuels, and strategies for bridging that gap.

“Pacific Environment applauds Republic of Korea’s leadership and investment in zero-emissions shipping,” said Hyunju Kang, Asia Climate Campaign Director.

“The Republic of Korea has set ambitious targets at the international level, while also committing nationally to green shipping goals. I am proud to partner with Korea to showcase their expertise with maritime decarbonisation and commitment to cleaning up the shipping industry in Korea.”

As major gateway ports in their respective regions, the BPA, NWSA, PoT, PoS and UPA MOU will include: Cooperation and alignment on maritime decarbonisation and in-port emissions reduction schemes and infrastructure improvements; collaboration to support the implementation of green shipping corridors; alignment on the standardisation of low-carbon marine fuel use and bunkering, engaging in capacity building and developing a strategy around industry engagement; partnership on digitisation (data sharing) processes; sharing of green practices, bunkering initiatives, business development opportunities and marketing cooperation; and lastly a pledge to share challenges, best practices and solutions.

Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday.
The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance.","Adaptation indicators, including the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the Paris Agreement, as well as the NDCs submitted so far for the 2030 period, the Just Transition Work Programme, and the delivery of climate finance, among others, may be discussed during the negotiations.

Observers and negotiators who wished to remain anonymous warned that there are strong diplomatic headwinds that parties should be wary of. It is important to recollect that pressured by the United States, member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), postponed a vote on a strategic plan to move the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuel and become ‘net-zero’ by 2050.

The US warned of retaliatory restrictions and sanctions against countries that vote in favour of an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) proposal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, observers said. “Similar fears are there, and there may be pressure on particular parties. That is why COP30 will be diplomatically a very challenging environment,” an observer said.

On Friday, the COP30 Presidency of Brazil sent out its ninth letter to Parties, which sums up what is likely to come up. The letter invites all Parties to help turn gaps into levers.

Drawing from the latest reports, including the Global Tipping Points Report, the letter acknowledges the scale of challenges ahead and the tools to respond as the global community gathers in Belém.

Following the completion of the Paris Rulebook at COP29, the latest edition will be the first COP where the full policy cycle of the Paris Agreement is in motion. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and the Enhanced Transparency Framework are now active instruments of global climate governance, the letter states.

While it may appear like the stakes are not as high as, say, last year when the New Collective Quantified Goal was on the table for negotiation, thepositions countries take may still send important signals, experts said.

HT reported on November 6 that the Brazilian COP30 and Azerbaijan COP29 Presidencies have released the much-awaited report on the ‘Baku To Belem Roadmap To USD 1.3T’, which documents how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. But this document will not be negotiated on and remains outside the work of COP30.

“I urge all Parties to use our work under the negotiating agenda as a Mutirão (collective effort) for shifting the Paris policy cycle from design to delivery. COP30 can signal the maturation of the regime – from negotiation to coordinated implementation – anchored in equity, science, and cooperation,” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 President, wrote in his latest letter.

China may assume a prominent role

Observers believe that China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, is positioning itself to fill the void created by the US, especially because it also has economic interests in the green transition.

“Earlier this year, at a COP event in April 2025 - the Leaders’ Summit on Climate and Just Transitions, President Xi Jinping made a strong pitch for China to remain committed to global climate goals. Xi criticised ‘major countries’ for their unilateralism, iterating China’s support for international climate cooperation through multilateral governance platforms. Xi has called China a ‘doer’, one that has taken strong action for tangible results,” said Pooja Vijay Ramamurthi, fellow, Centre For Social and Economic Progress. “Second, Xi also called out the protectionist stances of powers of the free circulation of high-quality green products, and promotion of technological innovation and industrial transformation through cooperation. Therefore, given that these are the stances of China at previous climate events, it will certainly take up a leadership role,” she added.

China may call for the continuation of multilateral platforms, encouraging countries to engage in constructive climate negotiations. It will point out its own large-scale, rapid green transitions, positioning itself as a leader whose model can be followed. Rather than keeping a low profile, it is expected that China will portray itself a champion of green transitions, given that other major powers such as the US are backing down.

It will however, as usual, place itself into the Global South camp, calling for solidarity against ramping down coal too soon. This has been reflected in China’s NDCs, which some critics do not find as ambitious as some expected, Ramamurthi noted.

Adaptation likely to be critical for India

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“The time for promises is now over. COP30 must mark the shift from a bank of commitments to a true bank of actions, where delivery, not declarations, defines progress. Nowhere is this more urgent than in South Asia, a region on the front lines of the climate crisis, from the small island states like Sri Lanka to the mountains of Nepal, and the vulnerable states of India among others. For India, climate action is both a necessity and an opportunity driven by innovation and powered by partnerships. But to succeed, the world must come together through smarter, more inclusive multilateralism that rewards implementation and builds genuine coalitions of the doing,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and special envoy for COP30 representing South Asia.

The COP when 1.5 degree C goal became obsolete

It will be important to look at how Parties respond to various scientific indicators at COP30. Temporary exceedance of the Paris Agreement’s lower limit or the 1.5 degree C goal is now certain, the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report, indicates. “New scenarios show that limiting warming to 1.5 degree C by 2100 remains technically possible. However, due to the continued delay in deep emission cuts, 1.5 degree C pathways now imply higher temporary exceedance of this temperature target. The magnitude and duration of this overshoot must be limited as much as possible. Each year of delayed action locks in carbon-intensive infrastructure. It results in greater losses for people and ecosystems, higher adaptation costs and a heavier reliance on costly and uncertain carbon dioxide (CO2) removal,” the report has said.

Further, The Global Tipping Points Report 2025, by the University of Exeter and international partners including the Stockholm Resilience Centre, found that widespread mortality of warm-water coral reefs is now underway as the world reaches its first climate tipping point. Forests are also an important issue. Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday. The TFFF is an initiative that incentivizes the conservation and expansion of tropical forests by making annual payments to Tropical Forest Countries that maintain their standing forest. India will join the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), Brazil’s global initiative to curb deforestation, as an “observer,” Dinesh Bhatia, ambassador of India to Brazil said in his statement on day 2 of the Belem Leaders’ Summit on Friday.

“The Amazon embodies the truth that awaits us in Belém: the future of humanity and the health of the planet are inseparable.

Observers and negotiators who wished to remain anonymous warned that there are strong diplomatic headwinds that parties should be wary of. It is important to recollect that pressured by the United States, member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), postponed a vote on a strategic plan to move the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuel and become ‘net-zero’ by 2050.

The US warned of retaliatory restrictions and sanctions against countries that vote in favour of an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) proposal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, observers said. “Similar fears are there, and there may be pressure on particular parties. That is why COP30 will be diplomatically a very challenging environment,” an observer said.

On Friday, the COP30 Presidency of Brazil sent out its ninth letter to Parties, which sums up what is likely to come up. The letter invites all Parties to help turn gaps into levers.

Drawing from the latest reports, including the Global Tipping Points Report, the letter acknowledges the scale of challenges ahead and the tools to respond as the global community gathers in Belém.

Following the completion of the Paris Rulebook at COP29, the latest edition will be the first COP where the full policy cycle of the Paris Agreement is in motion. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and the Enhanced Transparency Framework are now active instruments of global climate governance, the letter states.

While it may appear like the stakes are not as high as, say, last year when the New Collective Quantified Goal was on the table for negotiation, thepositions countries take may still send important signals, experts said.

HT reported on November 6 that the Brazilian COP30 and Azerbaijan COP29 Presidencies have released the much-awaited report on the ‘Baku To Belem Roadmap To USD 1.3T’, which documents how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. But this document will not be negotiated on and remains outside the work of COP30.

“I urge all Parties to use our work under the negotiating agenda as a Mutirão (collective effort) for shifting the Paris policy cycle from design to delivery. COP30 can signal the maturation of the regime – from negotiation to coordinated implementation – anchored in equity, science, and cooperation,” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 President, wrote in his latest letter.

China may assume a prominent role

Observers believe that China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, is positioning itself to fill the void created by the US, especially because it also has economic interests in the green transition.

“Earlier this year, at a COP event in April 2025 - the Leaders’ Summit on Climate and Just Transitions, President Xi Jinping made a strong pitch for China to remain committed to global climate goals. Xi criticised ‘major countries’ for their unilateralism, iterating China’s support for international climate cooperation through multilateral governance platforms. Xi has called China a ‘doer’, one that has taken strong action for tangible results,” said Pooja Vijay Ramamurthi, fellow, Centre For Social and Economic Progress. “Second, Xi also called out the protectionist stances of powers of the free circulation of high-quality green products, and promotion of technological innovation and industrial transformation through cooperation. Therefore, given that these are the stances of China at previous climate events, it will certainly take up a leadership role,” she added.

China may call for the continuation of multilateral platforms, encouraging countries to engage in constructive climate negotiations. It will point out its own large-scale, rapid green transitions, positioning itself as a leader whose model can be followed. Rather than keeping a low profile, it is expected that China will portray itself a champion of green transitions, given that other major powers such as the US are backing down.

It will however, as usual, place itself into the Global South camp, calling for solidarity against ramping down coal too soon. This has been reflected in China’s NDCs, which some critics do not find as ambitious as some expected, Ramamurthi noted.

Adaptation likely to be critical for India

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines.
Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.","“While we support the IMO in getting these vital regulations right, the vote to delay the Net-Zero Framework for a year will make progress more challenging. If global regulatory development breaks down further and the delay extends beyond 12-months, instead of one global framework, shipping could face a potential patchwork of regional emissions schemes with different compliance systems. Without the right support, this fragmentation would delay decision-making and keep current uncertainties around monitoring and reporting unresolved for the people working in shipping.

“The key here will be data management and integration. Whether it’s propulsion systems, voyage planning, onboard workflow, or design processes, the future of ship operations will favor solutions that connect data, technology and people seamlessly. Any regulation or technology that compounds the industry fragmentation will only add to the workload challenge, rather than help operators, seafarers and shoreside staff to support compliance and safe operations.

“The IMO’s decision does create more certainty that FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) will remain front and centre for longer. There will be renewed focus on FuelEU Maritime surplus (overcompliance) markets because companies that were waiting and monitoring how the regulations would fit with the IMO Net-Zero Framework will likely now commit.

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines. Penalties are robustly enforced and, at €2,400 per ton VLSFO energy equivalent, they are high enough to encourage investment in alternative green fuels. With renewable fuel energy density, availability and cost in mind – this can, in turn, increase demand for efficiency technologies.

“Navigating the regulatory maze is imperative, but the reality is, many technologies already make commercial sense right now. Take wind propulsion, for example. Installations have doubled over the past two years, reflecting how operators now see this as a financially viable solution, regardless of the Net-Zero Framework, and not an experiment. Voyage optimization is another example. What was once a ‘nice to have’ is now a boardroom priority, because the savings on fuel and emissions directly impact competitiveness.

“Our joint simulation project between NAPA, Norsepower, and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Marine & Engineering, for example, has validated the emissions reduction potential of combining wind propulsion with voyage optimization. The study has confirmed that the combination can deliver up to 28% emissions reductions on average.

Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).
Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels.","EU shipping emissions reached their highest levels last year since the EU introduced mandatory reporting in 2018, T&E’s analysis of official EU MRV data shows. A jump of 13% came despite a downtick in EU-related seaborne trade, with disruption of trade through the Red Sea likely leading to longer routes. Last year’s record emissions levels show how important it is that emissions are priced by the EU, says T&E, which calls for an expansion to smaller vessels.

Container ships were the main drivers of increased emissions with a 46% increase. This is likely explained by an 18% increase in the average distance sailed and 3% average growth in operational speeds, as well as an increase in the number of ships needed to service longer routes. Shipping emissions are very sensitive to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, said: “Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial.”

The ETS for shipping has now been in place for almost two years and is proving effective, with around 99% compliance already in the first year. The upcoming review is a chance for the EU to stay the course on maritime climate regulation by strengthening and extending the system to ensure all polluters pay their fair share, says T&E.

MSC remains the most polluting shipping company in the EU, responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of CO2. Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

Despite Europe using ever more renewable energy, imports of fossil fuels remain stubbornly high. Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels.

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.
According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:50.547860

The US is pressuring countries to reject the IMO's proposed Net-Zero Framework for shipping emissions, warning of trade penalties, reported Washington's Politico.

The framework, endorsed by an IMO working group in April, requires final approval from a qualified majority of the 176 member states. US delegates walked out of talks earlier this year and sent a letter in August urging others to block the proposal.

The letter stated that President trump opposes any international environmental agreement that 'unduly or unfairly burdens' the US or its interests. The administration has threatened tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies for countries backing the IMO deal.

Industry groups are urging the EU to clarify its position. They want assurances that shippers won't face double regulation under both the IMO framework and the EU's Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime Regulation.

European Shipowners formalised their request in a October letter to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas. Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the EU would review its rules if the IMO deal imposes significant costs, but industry says more clarity is needed.

Major shipping nations including Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, Norway and Denmark have signed a joint statement urging the EU to align with the IMO framework.

Some shipping groups remain sceptical. Last month, a coalition of oil tanker operators called for the IMO's approach to be reconsidered.

The IMO's Net-Zero Framework includes emissions reduction mandates and a pricing mechanism to penalise non-compliance and reward greener fuels. Global shipping accounts for about three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite opposition from the US and some oil-producing countries, 63 IMO members expressed support for the framework in April. Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment said this shows strong momentum for cleaner shipping.

Decarbonizing shipping can deliver significant economic and climate benefits. The IMO Net-Zero framework is the first in the world to combine mandatory emissions limits with GHG pricing across an entire industry sector. It has the potential to unlock an estimated USD 1 trillion in investments in new fuel production, supply chains, and new or retrofitted vessels, while creating up to four million cumulative green jobs by 2050 across the entire energy value chain. Projections indicate that the maritime sector could represent around 15% of the future green hydrogen market. The IMO Net-Zero Fund is expected to generate USD 10–12 billion per year to support a just and equitable transition for developing countries, as well as to finance innovation, infrastructure, capacity building, and measures to mitigate negative impacts, such as on food security.

1) The IMO Net Zero Fund is projected to generate $11-12 billion per year until 2035

2) Create up to four million cumulative green jobs by 2050

3) Around USD 1 trillion investments needed to decarbonize shipping

4) 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen are needed to achieve 5% zero emission fuels by 2030 reaching 90MT by 2040.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totalled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages.

Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the UN's International Maritime Organisation, voted to postpone for one year a controversial decision that would have helped to set unreasonable global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80 per cent of global trade.

More than 70 per cent of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15 per cent for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29 per cent of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at nine per cent, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about one per cent, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48 per cent in 2023 and 18 per cent in 2024 to just 10 per cent in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.

Money, you say?

Bingo. But the projected annual US$15 billion bill facing container shipping lines and other carriers under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only one line item in the decarbonization cost projections for maritime freight movement.

Cargo ships are seen lined up outside the Port of Los Angeles, Feb. 23, 2021, in Los Angeles, (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File).

And money is only one shipping industry red flag.

As noted previously in the Substack Shipping News, the estimated annual cost to decarbonize maritime shipping ranges between US$8 billion and US$28 billion.

Make that US$90 billion if you factor in the investment in bunkering and the other energy transition infrastructure needed.

Overall, the bill for reaching the IMO’s 2050 zero-emission shipping destination is estimated at US$1.6 trillion.

But that is just a ballpark, big-picture number.

A small example of the impact on everyday operating costs was provided during an October 8 review of the main findings in DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025.

Eirik Ovrum, the report’s lead author and the principal maritime environmental technology consultant for the maritime industry risk-management company, noted that the IMO’s NZF “will effectively double fuel costs by around 2036.”

That raises another NZF red flag issue: what lower-carbon fuel and what technology required to turn that fuel into efficient and financially viable propulsion power will be commercially available to shipping fleets embarked on ambitious decarbonization initiatives?

The answer today is not enough of either. That explains in part why the adoption of heavy marine oil (HMO) alternatives remains minimal.

According to DNV data, 2,851 ships out of a global fleet of 120,936 have dual-fuel technology. That is just over 2%. And only 8.9% of total gross tonnage today is powered by alternative fuels.

The HMO alternative for most of those dual-fuel ships (1,539) is liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The good news for NZF fans and decarbonization advocates is that 51% of new ship orders include dual-fuel technology.

Most of those are containerships.

But the IMO is not big on LNG.

DNV’s Maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen has taken the organization to task for erecting roadblocks that “make the pathway less attractive” for shipping to incorporate LNG in its decarbonization toolbox, even though approximately 600 ships sailing today have dual-fuel LNG engines, and another 700 on order will have that technology.

Lower carbon propulsion fuel availability is a major concern for ocean carriers.

Ørbeck-Nilssen has estimated that to hit its 2030 20% emissions reduction target, the maritime shipping sector will need between one-quarter and one-third of the projected global supply of low-GHG fuels.

More low-GHG propulsion fuel technology is being installed in containerships and other ocean-going vessels, but the percentage of dual-fuel ships in the world’s commercial fleet remains tiny | DNV

During DNV’s October 8 session, Ovrum speculated that ocean carriers could only source enough biodiesel to hit that 2030 goal if “road transportation stopped using biodiesel and gave it all to shipping.”

And that is just the fuel-use and availability side of the energy transition equation. Other challenges include the complexities and costs of refitting ships with dual-fuel technologies, allocating space aboard vessels for less energy-dense fuels, and incorporating costly and complex onboard carbon capture systems.

But another red flag raised following the U.S.A.’s NZF rejection in August is this: should a UN agency be entrusted with instituting and policing the initiative and collecting and disbursing the levies raised?

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have those member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided.”

– Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez thinks so.

At DNV’s September 16 launch of its Energy Transition Outlook 2025 report, Dominguez was confident that member states at the Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London would approve the initiative.

During his discussion with Ørbeck-Nilssen, he downplayed doubts about the approval.

Dominguez told the audience that “there is a consensus to move forward” with the framework.

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided. So, I’m still confident that we will continue to move forward [in] October.”

Dominguez got the month right, but not the year.

Countries opted to delay the NZF adoption vote to October 2026, which could push its implementation down the road to 2030.

In the meantime, America’s NZF opposition is another example of its distrust of the UN.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.

John Lightbourn, a commercial shipping financier and the founder of U.S.-based Cavalier Shipping, suggested that the NZF implementation delay “could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — perhaps an acknowledgment that the IMO and, in turn, the UN, might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.”

He added that waning U.S. financial support for the UN raises questions about where funds collected under the NZF would end up and “whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the UN’s operating budget.”

Shipping consultant Darren Shelton agreed that delaying NZF implementation might be better in the long run.

In a LinkedIn post, the Moran Shipping Agencies sales director wrote that “the postponement, while frustrating, may be the only responsible choice.”

He maintained that it would provide “a pause long enough to ask whether the IMO’s traditional structure can still manage a borderless industry shaped by private enterprise and accelerating technology.”

Shelton added that “progress in shipping has always depended on realism … Ports, fuels, and safety rules evolve through collaboration between practitioners, not speeches by politicians.”
