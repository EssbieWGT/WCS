The global reduction in sulphur content in ship fuels has inadvertently worsened coral bleaching events on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, according to a study that was published Thursday by researchers from the University of Melbourne, led by Dr. Robert Ryan, in the journal Nature.

The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 2020 regulation, which slashed the maximum sulphur content in marine fuels from 3.5% to 0.5%, significantly improved air quality by cutting harmful emissions.

The Guardian reported that the “cleaner” shipping has removed a previously overlooked cooling effect in the atmosphere.

Since 2025, a descarbonização do setor marítimo brasileiro ganhou prioridade estratégica. During COP30, realized in November 2025, in Belém, o país lançou dois instrumentos centrais. O Programa Nacional de Descarbonização de Portos (PND-Portos) e o Programa Nacional de Descarbonização da Navegação (PND-Navegação) passaram a orientar políticas públicas e investimentos. Like this, o Brasil alinhou sua agenda à redução de emissões no transporte aquaviário.

At the same time, estudos setoriais reforçaram a urgência do tema. Pesquisa da Boston Consulting Group apontou a indústria marítima global como emissora de milhares de toneladas de CO₂, o que amplia a pressão por mudanças. That is why, o debate ganhou força no país e avançou rapidamente.

Sob a coordenação do Ministério de Portos e Aeroportos (MPor), os programas nacionais buscam atender às metas da Organização Marítima Internacional (IMO). Until 2050, a organização estabeleceu net zero emissions for the sector. Additionally, there are several leisure, a IMO avançou na cobrança de taxas por tonelada de CO₂ acima de limites definidos. In this way, eficiência ambiental e custo operacional passaram a caminhar juntos.

In practice, as iniciativas estimulam eletrificação portuária, providing energia limpa a navios atracados. parallel, promote reduction in the use of fossil fuels during operations. Consequently, os ganhos ambientais se combinam com maior previsibilidade regulatória.

Meanwhile, o Brasil aparece como parte da solução energética. In September 2025, durante eventos do Brazil Climate Summit, em Nova York, Boston Consulting Group destacou o potencial nacional. According to the study, a produção brasileira de biofuels pode suprir up to 15% of global demand do setor marítimo. Like this, o país reforça sua posição estratégica.

In this context, biodiesel de soja apresenta vantagem técnica relevante. According to the data, o combustível emite 48% menos CO₂ por megajoule quando comparado ao diesel tradicional. Therefore, a alternativa contribui para metas climáticas sem ruptura operacional.

Additionally, there are several leisure, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) já mostrou resultados concretos. Durante a COP30, em 2025, embarcações usadas como hotéis flutuantes foram abastecidas com GNL. Thereby, there was redução entre 20% e 30% das emissões frente ao diesel. Logo, a tecnologia se consolidou como opção de transição.

In this scenario, a liderança empresarial também se manifesta. Thiago NascimentoCEO of Maritime Ship Service, stated that a sustentabilidade é essencial ao desenvolvimento responsável da cadeia logística marítima. According to him, a COP30 colocou o Brasil em evidência e acelerou ações práticas para minimize environmental impacts.

In addition, o arcabouço regulatório avançou. June 2025, o governo publicou a Política Marítima Nacionalthrough the Decree No. 12.481 / 2025, in the Official Gazette of the Union. The text prevê medidas para reduction of greenhouse gases, controle de resíduos e gestão sustentável dos recursos marinhos. Like this, a política integra ambiente, logística e desenvolvimento.

Still in 2025, o MPor lançou o Sustainability Pact. The initiative reconhece empresas portuárias e de navegação que adotam boas práticas socioambientais e de governança. Como incentivo, participantes podem receber selos ambientais, reforçando compromissos voluntários com a agenda ESG.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mar_navio_1200px.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:36:51.408350

Breaking the bloc Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal.
“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets – but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.","The Greek government is working on a proposal with the United States and Saudi Arabia to curb CO2 emissions from shipping, bypassing EU coordination on the issue.

The proposal is under discussion at the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO). Athens is abandoning a joint EU position on global shipping decarbonisation, which is currently frozen at the IMO.

“Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate, through their competent ministries – shipping and energy – with a view to submitting a joint proposal on this specific matter,” Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said on Thursday, following a meeting in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud.

Athens is providing a “voice of realism” on energy issues in Europe, Papastavrou added.

The move is expected to raise eyebrows in Brussels. That’s because individual EU countries are expected to seek agreement with the remaining 26 rather than cooperate with third countries on a matter over which the European Commission holds exclusive competence.

It is already the second time Athens, home to much of the global shipping industry, has broken the bloc’s ranks after Greece, alongside Cyprus, abstained during an October vote in London on a global net-zero shipping deal.

At the centre of the debate is the Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NSF), which would force ship operators continuing to use the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportionate to their excess CO2 emissions.

In practice, the framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy, favouring countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

However, agreement on the proposal was postponed for a year last October following opposition from Washington and Riyadh. The US administration even threatened sanctions if the deal went ahead, as Washington supports liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel.

The diplomatic row last October was widely seen as another instance of Europe being caught in a broader geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing. Denmark, which opposed the US line, appears to have paid a price, having failed for the first time in late November to secure re-election to the IMO Council.

Breaking the bloc

Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal. Now Greece appears to have renegotiated the deal with Washington and Riyadh, not Brussels.

But Greece’s position could trigger an infringement procedure within the EU.

One EU diplomat noted that only the EU as a whole can table a common position at the IMO, and that in the event of internal disagreement, the bloc simply has no official position.

“Member states do not align themselves with third-country camps,” the diplomat added.

Following the publication of the article, a Greek government source told Euractiv that Athens intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to reach an agreement that serves both the US and Europe.

Cian Delaney, biofuels campaigner at T&E, said: “Soy biofuels are twice as bad for the planet as fossil diesel.

Biofuels have been widely promoted across the EU since the adoption of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) in 2009. In 2019, the introduction of the high ILUC Delegated Act confirmed a phase-out of palm biofuels by 2030. Soy will now be subjected to the same fate. While this does remove one of the most damaging feedstocks from Europe’s energy mix, growing EU demand for biofuels means that the scramble for feedstocks will still intensify.

More than 100 million tonnes of sugar cane is used in global biofuels production today. This is expected to grow by 50% by 2030. This includes problematic projects in regions like Papua, Indonesia, where clearance of natural forest is already underway to make space for sugarcane cultivation.

The warning has renewed and intensified scrutiny of how maritime decarbonization commitments are being translated into action. This means emissions are being priced before the infrastructure needed to reduce them is in place, raising costs for operators without yet delivering equivalent emissions reductions.

More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognized as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.

Against this backdrop, attention is turning to solutions that translate regulation and ambition into real emissions reductions, enabling ferry, short-sea cruise and RoRo operators to act in practice rather than absorb rising costs.

NatPower Marine says the concerns raised by the ferry industry further highlight a widening gap between regulation and the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Pricing emissions without rapidly giving operators the means to reduce them risks increasing costs, undermining route viability and pushing up ticket prices, without accelerating real-world decarbonization. In some cases, this may even weaken the role of ferries in shifting passengers and freight away from higher-emissions road transport.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine UK, said the Interferry warning reflects a structural challenge facing maritime transport. “The ferry industry is signaling that obligations are rising faster than the infrastructure needed to meet them,” he said. “Climate policy only delivers results when operators can act on it in practice.”

While much of the regulatory debate continues to focus on long-term fuel pathways, NatPower Marine recognizes that short-sea ferry and RoPax routes present the most immediate opportunity to turn Green Shipping Corridors from commitments into operational reality. These services operate on fixed schedules, with frequent port calls and sufficient dwell time to fully benefit from port-side electrification.

Shore power and high-capacity e-ship charging enable vessels to eliminate emissions while at berth, delivering immediate reductions in carbon dioxide alongside significant cuts in nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulate matter. In addition to improving compliance metrics such as the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator, port-side power delivers tangible air-quality benefits for port cities and island communities that depend on ferry services.

Sommadossi said electrifying ports strengthens ferries as part of the climate solution rather than penalizing them. “If emissions pricing pushes freight and passengers away from ferries and back onto already congested road networks, overall emissions increase,” he said. “Port-side power does the opposite. It reinforces sea transport as the lowest-emissions corridor and supports long-standing objectives to shift traffic from road to sea.”

The company points to routes such as the 142 mile (123 nautical miles) Heysham–Belfast route as examples of how short-sea Green Shipping Corridors can move rapidly from policy ambition to delivery on the quayside. By installing shore power and e-ship charging infrastructure at the port, emissions can be cut immediately, giving operators the confidence to invest in electric and hybrid vessels.

The Heysham initiative represents a landmark step forward, with the potential to eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually and sending a clear signal of commitment from all involved.

NatPower Marine’s route-based, fully funded infrastructure model removes the need for upfront capital investment by ferry operators, enabling decarbonization to scale without compromising connectivity, affordability, or competitiveness.

“The challenge facing maritime decarbonization is not a lack of ambition,” Sommadossi concluded. “Since the Clydebank Declaration, regulation has accelerated, from FuelEU Maritime to the EU ETS, while a global IMO framework remains uncertain. What has not kept pace is the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Short-sea corridors show that when port-side power is in place, emissions fall immediately and commercially. That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:57:42.953029

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix for shipping, and it can provide a practical roadmap for procurement teams to align them with long-term decarbonization goals. The approach lets teams polegać on interoperable technologie, with early testing on key lanes delivering actionable data to guide scale-up.

Concrete data from trials show emissions reductions depend on the fuel and the supply chain. Green hydrogen produced from renewables can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 90% versus heavy fuel oil on selected routes, while biofuels such as ISCC-certified fats and oils or hydrotreated vegetable oil typically deliver 60-80% reductions, depending on feedstock and processing. To manage risk, start with a phased procurement plan and measure energy intensity as you scale.

Engaging cross-industry partners–ports, engine makers, fuel suppliers, insurers, and financiers–contributes to faster technology maturation. A conference this year will provide a platform to share data, which joins practical field insights there with policy signals to help operators plan investments and timelines.

To translate insights into action, build a procurement strategy that prioritizes long-term fuel guarantees, invest in bunkering infrastructure, and run pilot projects on flagship routes. Align with engine makers to ensure technologie are retrofitted and crews trained; monitor performance, fuel compatibility, and safety margins; keep track of costs and availability so supply chains remain reliable. This work will require cross-silo collaboration and clear governance.

There remains a path forward: as technologie become perfected, costs fall and supply chains mature. The entire industry benefits when pozyskiwanie levers are aligned with route planning, port calls, and vessel design; with ongoing engaging forums and cross-industry collaboration, ship operators can move toward a decarbonized future.

MSC Sees Hydrogen and Biofuels in Shipping’s Future Fuel Mix and Hydrogen Council Collaboration

Recommend launching a three-year mediterranean pilot program to test hydrogen and biofuel blends on scheduled routes, targeting a 20% hydrogen-in-fuel injection by 2030 and 50% by 2035, with six corridors and a marketplace-ready plan to demonstrate a revenue-neutral model that scales with demand.

Hydrogen Council collaboration should establish a unified fuel standard, actively facilitate cross-border sharing of fuel data, and create a joint marketplace for supply and logistics that reduces downtime and cost disruption for fleets.

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix and positions them as an alternative to traditional bunker fuels. Related pilots show blended solutions can cut sulfur emissions and improve carbon intensity across mediterranean ports while maintaining reliability for the fleet.

To overcome infrastructure gaps, the plan coordinates public-private funding to provide anchor investments in ports, storage, bunkering, and injection points, while building supply chain visibility that can scale with demand.

Active collaboration across industry stakeholders will capture massive volume growth as more terminals and shipyards join. There is growing investor appetite for early-stage deployment, and the source of hydrogen from renewable electricity and biofuel supply chains is critical. The approach must be engaging for customers and port authorities alike, with transparent reporting and sharing of results.

Given the scale, MSC must facilitate ongoing data sharing, track performance, and report progress quarterly; the partnership contributes to a diversified energy mix and a resilient marketplace that accepts blended fuels across the mediterranean fleet.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes?

Pilot HVO blends on mediterranean core routes now and scale renewable methanol on select corridors within 12–18 months.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes? The current program centers on three fuels with proven compatibility and scalable supply chains:

Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) blended with MGO up to 30–50% on a portion of the fleet serving mediterranean and adjacent EU corridors, preserving engine performance while cutting lifecycle emissions.

FAME biodiesel blends (20–40%) on high-density container lanes and feeder services, with careful monitoring of storage, cold flow, and bunker compatibility.

Renewable methanol (bio-methanol) as an alternative on selected short-haul core routes, enabling a near-term decarbonisation pathway and aligning with portside bunkering density.

To accelerate deployment, MSC forms partnerships with fuel suppliers, ports, and companies, embedding a darr framework to track data and performance. The maritime network in the mediterranean is expanding, strengthening marketplace options and giving the fleet confidence to scale. This development approach prioritises blended fuels first and includes a perfected handling process to ensure seamless container ship operations and smooth bunkering. Further steps include extending pilots to additional core routes and refining supply chains. These steps help decarbonise maritime operations.

What hydrogen readiness steps are needed for MSC ships?

Begin with a term-based hydrogen readiness plan that decarbonise a subset of MSC shippings and push the broader fleet toward a measurable decarbonisation path, anchored by groups across member companies and external partners to guarantee a neutral, data-driven assessment of which technologies perform best.

Map routes and demand to determine the hydrogen source and the scale of on-board storage and injection needs. Evaluate options including high-pressure tanks, cryogenic LH2, and carrier-based approaches, and plan how injection will feed main engines or auxiliary power with clear safety interlocks and fuel-handling workflows, to capture learning for the next wave of upgrades.

Choose propulsion concepts MSC can retrofit: dual-fuel engines or hydrogen-only modules; outline the technical work, required certifications, and how systems will integrate with propulsion, power, and hull design.

Develop safety and compliance frameworks: standardised design rules, crew training, leak detection, bunkering procedures, and emergency response plans aligned with port authorities and flag states.

Build a massive bunkering and storage network in key ports to support a steady supply, plus on-shore generation or reliable hydrogen source injection; design a term-based sourcing approach with suppliers and ensure a neutral, traceable supply chain.

Set up governance across the groups: a cross-functional steering body, clear milestones, and a data-sharing term that measures fuel efficiency, emissions reductions, and operational risk, with feedback loops to scale the programme across the member fleet.

Which port and bunkering upgrades are planned to support hydrogen?

Implement a phased bunkering blueprint that pairs fixed hydrogen hubs with mobile units, using standardized 350/700 bar interfaces and dual-hose transfer. Equip berths with on-site electrolysis capacity of 10–20 MW where wind or solar is available, and store hydrogen in cryogenic tanks sized at 2 × 20,000 kg per berth. Ensure injection lines and shore connections meet ISO 19880-1 standards and include robust safety systems, leak detection, and pressure management. This configuration mainly targets reliable supply for large vessels while enabling rapid fueling, helping to overcome gaps during peak port calls. MSC says the approach centers on decarbonization and invites collaboration across groups including shippings, energy providers, and port authorities. The plan also contemplates both green hydrogen production and blue options that may rely on capture when CCS is deployed.

Given the need for scale, ports should align with conference-led industry work and standardization bodies to harmonize interfaces. Build partnerships with energy suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and shipping lines to share risk and investment, and establish a neutral governance model that prioritizes safety and interoperability. Define the source of hydrogen to ensure transparency, and prepare for injections and meters that support different hydrogen sources, including green electrolysis and blue hydrogen from low-emission reforming. Prioritize a phased rollout: start with a few berths per port, then expand as demand grows and maintenance schedules allow, while exploring alternative fuels integration where feasible.

Port Planned Upgrades Capacity/Timeline Partners/Notes Port of Rotterdam (Netherlands) Two fixed H2 bunkering berths at Maasvlakte; 350/700 bar delivery; on-site 10–20 MW electrolyzer; cryogenic storage for 2 × 20,000 kg; shore-to-ship injection lines; safety and monitoring 2025–2027 (phase 1), full rollout by 2028 Port Authority, major energy players, shipping lines; CCS pilot for blue H2 Singapur STS bunkering readiness; fixed 350 bar stations; on-site 5–10 MW electrolyzer; storage ~2 × 10,000 kg; pipeline tie-in to LNG hub; injection lines 2026–2028 MPA, local utilities, energy firms; emphasis on interoperable interfaces Los Angeles/Long Beach (USA) On-site green hydrogen production (5–15 MW); fixed berths; 350/700 bar; storage 2 × 15,000 kg; mobile bunkering support; injections and safety 2027–2029 Port Authorities, regional energy partners, shipping groups Busan (South Korea) Hydrogen bunkering readiness; fixed stations; 350/700 bar; on-site electrolyzer 5–10 MW; storage 2 × 8,000–12,000 kg; integration with national hydrogen grid 2026–2028 Busan Port Authority, energy companies, local shipowners

These upgrades create a practical, scalable hydrogen supply chain at key hubs, supporting collaborations across development work and cross-border partnerships. The focus remains on clean source diversification, safe injection practices, and continuous improvement as shippings adopt hydrogen as a core element of the decarbonization agenda.

What milestones does the Hydrogen Council collaboration target and when?

Target deployments by 2025 and scale to mainstream use by 2030–2035, with concrete steps to decarbonize the entire shipping sector. The plan focuses on biofuels and hydrogen as alternative fuels, designed to raise efficiency and reduce emissions. Yesterday’s pilots validated the approach and provided information that fuels further development, which informs timelines for scale and sharing across companies.

2025 – Pilot deployments across three cross-border corridors to test hydrogen and biofuels blends aboard merchant ships. Target cumulative volume of 0.2 million tonnes of low-carbon fuels; aim for 10–15% efficiency gains on pilot routes; actively share findings to accelerate learning and establish related safety and operation standards among participating companies.

2027 – Scale-up framework established: standardized bunkering procedures, procurement processes, and safety rules; port readiness in 10 hubs; retrofit or conversion of 15 vessels; aim to reduce lifecycle emissions on the test routes by 20–25%; information sharing broadened to industry groups to support rapid implementation.

2030 – Commercial viability demonstrated on 5–7 major sea routes; fuel mix includes hydrogen and biofuels on a growing share of vessels, with 5–8% of newbuilds adopting low-carbon propulsion; production capacity for low-carbon fuels reaches about 2 million tonnes per year; price parity targets advanced to enable broader scale adoption.

2035 – Mainstream adoption across mid-sized and large fleets: 20–25% of newbuilds powered by hydrogen or biofuels; bunkering networks expand to 30+ hubs; overall volume of low-carbon fuels in shipping increases substantially, supporting a measurable decarbonization of main trade lanes while maintaining efficiency improvements in operations.

2040 – Extended scale and sustained development: 40–60% of new ships use low-carbon fuels; decarbonization of the entire sector accelerates, driven by continued collaboration and sharing of information; biofuels and hydrogen supply chains mature to support ongoing growth, with related sectors such as ports and logistics benefiting from the pioneering approach.

How will transition costs, incentives, and financing be managed?

Establish a pioneering, multi-stakeholder council that leads blended financing and procurement for fuel switch, with term sheets and volume forecasts to reduce upfront costs for container groups and fleets.

Agree on a shared risk framework where upfront capex for engines, storage, and bunkering infra is financed via SPVs and green bonds, with long-term offtake commitments from groups of companies. By spreading risk across a portfolio, a company can reduce the annualized cost of transition and accelerate the massive uptake of hydrogen and blended fuels. This framework contributes to predictable budgeting for sponsors and shipowners.

Link incentives to emissions outcomes and volume milestones, using subsidies, tax credits, and concessional lending from public programs. A push from ports and governments to create dedicated blending hubs reduces supply risk, while a council can authorize sharing of ramp-up costs across routes, ensuring there’s enough capacity to meet demand. The council will produce monthly reports to track progress and reinforce accountability.

Theres a need to set up reserve funds to handle price swings and port readiness delays, minimizing disruption to the fleet.

Launch a mass procurement program for fuels across suppliers to capture volume discounts, with a rolling tender for blended fuels and hydrogen-ready solutions. A container-fleet-wide procurement hub reduces price volatility, and the specs that suppliers must meet across ports along major corridors ensure reliability.

The financing framework uses a term of 7-12 years for engine retrofits and bunkering upgrades, with performance-based payments tied to fleet emissions reductions and fuel savings. Engaging shipping lines in a consortium creates a clear push for scalable solutions, ensuring there’s capacity as volumes rise along key corridors. Early pilots in three ports produce data on cost per ton-km and capture benefits from hydrogen blends and biofuels.",https://blog.gettransport.com/wp-content/themes/main/img/favicon/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-22 08:37:00.655189

With the IMO NZF’s future unclear, its carbon levy delayed and global politics more fractious than ever, MEPC’s October 2025 extraordinary session, and its one-year adjournment, now form the starting point for any assessment of IMO’s environmental agenda in 2026.

Where does the NZF currently stand?

On a technical level, the basic architecture of the framework survived attacks from US President Trump and others in 2025.

The approved draft package that makes up NZF combines a greenhouse gas fuel-intensity trajectory with a market-based measure and is backed by states that had argued for a flat-rate carbon levy to be contained within MARPOL Annexes.

IMO described the framework as a new set of regulations built around a tighter fuel-intensity standard and a linked pricing scheme for non-compliance and reward scheme for compliance.

The October session did not dismantle this structure; it only deferred the political decision on adoption.

Before delegates met in London, the working assumption was that October 2025 would deliver the adoption of revised MARPOL Annex VI text and agreement on the market-based measure, with measures entering into force 16 months later under the tacit acceptance procedure. That timetable would have placed the first compliance period around 2027.

With a vote delayed, politics will continue to shape discussions on the NZF in 2026: US Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright and Sean Duffy warned that countries backing the framework could face port fees, sanctions, investigations and visa restrictions.

A letter published by the US administration described the proposal as “the first global carbon tax” and a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations”.

Mr Trump then posted on X that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax” and said the United States would not adhere to “this global green new scam tax on shipping”.

In session at the extraordinary meeting of MEPC in October 2025, US interventions and those from other petro-states helped shift support towards a procedural motion that delayed the vote for one year.

Against this background, guideline work continues but the scope for manoeuvre is constrained.

IMO’s intersessional working groups, including ISWG-GHG 20 in September 2025, have agreed to continue developing guidelines and recommended that MEPC consider options for resuming the extraordinary session in October 2026.

Among other tasks, MEPC in 2026 is expected to take up terms of reference for the Fifth IMO GHG Study.

What happens next?

Three broad pathways emerge: if the resumed extraordinary session in October 2026 adopts the framework with only limited changes, IMO procedural rules and norms would point to entry into force for the legislation around March 2028.

If disagreements over pricing, revenue use and transitional pathways force extensive revisions, 2026 may be dominated by further drafting.

If political resistance hardens, agreement could slip again and regional measures multiply.

For shipowners, charterers and financiers, 2026 will therefore be less a new beginning than a complex negotiation inevitably shaped by choices already made, and Mr Trump has made clear his preferred outcome.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/177/Presideent_Trump_2_White_Housewebzhgfssswww_Main.png,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:16.985688

A meeting of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) opened today, as reported by the Clean Arctic Alliance. The Alliance, a coalition of 24 not-for-profit organizations, is calling on IMO member states to ensure the organization continues to push for progress in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where noise levels are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

""SDC 12 provides an opportunity for member states to ensure that shippers are getting clear technical guidance on the work they need to do in order to advance IMO policies that will assure the reduction of shipping noise"", said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy. ""So far, this work remains insufficient relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.""

Bobbe noted that much of the Arctic has been free of human-sourced sound for a long time, but with increased activity, its waters are becoming noisier every year. Shipping, specifically from propellers and engines, is an important source of this noise.

A key paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF provides new maps showing, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. The maps are intended to help mariners know where to take measures during migratory months in spring and autumn. Operational measures like rerouting and speed restrictions can reduce impacts on whales, alongside technical measures to quieten ships.

""By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them"", said Melanie Lancaster of WWF's Global Arctic Programme. ""It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.""

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic, similar to measures adopted elsewhere to safeguard whales. It provides information for similar preventative measures to be adopted in the Arctic.

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, linked the situation in the Arctic to concerns about proposed LNG terminals in the Gulf of California. ""Our recommendations to SDC 12 for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals"", Dumbrille said.

Those recommendations include acknowledging irreversible noise impacts from LNG tankers, promoting ship design that considers noise damage, and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological areas due to underwater noise pollution.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:11.867959

Interferry made clear that supports the decarbonization of maritime transport and accepted the EU ETS on the understanding that the funds collected would be reinvested in reducing emissions and that road transport would also be included.
This mechanism was intended to replace the EU ETS and provide clear guidelines for reinvesting revenues in decarbonization.
Interferry highlights that the EU ETS currently imposes approximately €1 billion per year on intra-EU ferry transport, yet the majority of the funds are diverted to national budgets rather than supporting the production of e-fuels or the electrification of EU ports.
The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately one billion euros per year, while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships.","As informed, the demand follows the recent decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS mechanism and the lack of clear regulations on the distribution of the funds collected. Interferry is calling for an immediate halt on the further implementation of the EU ETS for the ferry sector, maintaining the surrendering obligation for maritime emissions frozen at the 70% level scheduled for 2025, and halting the planned increase to 100% in 2026.

This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonization. The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector

… said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. According to Interferry, every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry made clear that supports the decarbonization of maritime transport and accepted the EU ETS on the understanding that the funds collected would be reinvested in reducing emissions and that road transport would also be included. However, the EU Council recently postponed the inclusion of road transport, raising concerns that ferry end users, such as island communities, are bearing the full cost of the ETS.

As explained, this situation creates a competitive disadvantage for short-sea shipping, as higher ferry costs may push goods and passengers back onto congested road networks, contrary to the EU’s long-standing goal of shifting transport from road to sea.

As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea

… commented Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

The challenge is compounded by the International Maritime Organization’s decision in October 2025 to postpone the adoption of a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This mechanism was intended to replace the EU ETS and provide clear guidelines for reinvesting revenues in decarbonization. In the meantime, EU ferry operators are taxed for CO2 emissions without clarity on how the funds will support emissions reduction or certainty on when a global regulation will take effect.

Interferry highlights that the EU ETS currently imposes approximately €1 billion per year on intra-EU ferry transport, yet the majority of the funds are diverted to national budgets rather than supporting the production of e-fuels or the electrification of EU ports.

The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately one billion euros per year, while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships.

The demand follows the recent decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS mechanism and the lack of clear regulations on the distribution of the funds collected.
Interferry wants the surrendering obligation for maritime emissions frozen at the 70% level scheduled for 2025, halting the planned increase to 100% in 2026.
“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” says Mike Corrigan (pictured), CEO of Interferry.
“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for RoRo and passenger ferries,” says Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.","The global trade association for the ferry industry, Interferry, is calling for an immediate halt to the further phasing-in of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) for the maritime sector.

Interferry wants the surrendering obligation for maritime emissions frozen at the 70% level scheduled for 2025, halting the planned increase to 100% in 2026.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” says Mike Corrigan (pictured), CEO of Interferry. “The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector.”

Interferry points out that ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry but says it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included. The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the short sea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, e.g. island communities, have to carry the full costs of ETS.

“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for RoRo and passenger ferries,” says Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea.”

Furthermore, in October 2025 the IMO postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism (as part of its Net Zero Framework) for at least 12 months – a framework that was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected. Meanwhile, Interferry points out that its members operating to and from EU ports are taxed for their CO2 emissions without a clear provision on how the money is reinvested to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and without certainty when a global IMO regulation will come into force – if at all.

“The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately one billion euros per year,” adds Roos, “while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships.

While clean fuels currently make up just over 1% of global clean energy investment, ambition is growing, reflected in initiatives such as the “Belém 4x” pledge, through which more than 25 countries committed at COP30 to quadruple production and use by 2035.

This approach is proving successful in unlocking projects by bridging the gap between the market risks and infrastructure-type investment that characterizes clean fuel projects.","As discussions at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos (19-23 January 2026) remain ongoing, a new report suggests that global clean fuel investment could rise from ~$25 billion today to over $100 billion annually by 2030 driven by new demand and government ambitions.

According to the “Fuelling the Future: How Business, Finance and Policy can Accelerate the Clean Fuels Market” report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in collaboration with Bain & Company, global investment in clean fuels will need to quadruple by 2030 to meet global clean fuel ambitions.

While clean fuels currently make up just over 1% of global clean energy investment, ambition is growing, reflected in initiatives such as the “Belém 4x” pledge, through which more than 25 countries committed at COP30 to quadruple production and use by 2035.

Furthermore. the report notes that achieving this ambition will require coordinated action across policy, finance and industry to bring forward a larger pipeline of viable projects that deliver returns to investors and long-term value to national economies.

Clean fuels represent an important pathway to advancing sustainability while continuing to supply the energy required by the global economic system.

…said Roberto Bocca, Head of the Centre for Energy and Materials, World Economic Forum.

The role of clean fuels in energy’s future

Liquid and gaseous fuels are vital to the global economy, supplying 56% of global final energy use today1 (~250 exajoules, EJ)2,3 and attracting ~$1 trillion of investment each year. Global energy demand is expected to continue to rise, driven by growth in both economies and populations.

While electrification is central to most energy scenarios, some transport and industrial energy demands cannot be substituted effectively with electricity. Additionally, clean fuels can help reduce emissions near-term, by using existing assets and established value chains that currently rely on unabated fossil fuels.

Across most scenarios, liquid and gaseous fuels will remain a significant share of the world’s energy supply for decades, with 2050 estimates ranging from 175-285 EJ (40-55% of total supply), equal to roughly four to five times current US demand Clean fuels span multiple production pathways, representing different combinations of feedstocks, conversion technologies and end-product fuels.

These fuels are a critical tool to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors such as transport and industry, where energy density, storability, chemical properties and infrastructure compatibility make molecules the most competitive or only option.

Molecules are particularly relevant for applications such as aviation, shipping, parts of road transport and certain industrial processes that require high heat or molecules as chemical feedstocks. Clean fuels also enable refineries to adapt to the shifting demand mix and sustain asset utilization by making use of existing energy infrastructure.

Scaling-up the market in the next decade calls for a dual focus. First, existing commercial pathways need expanding; second, greater innovation is required in early-stage pathways. Ramping up commercial fuels such as biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel – alongside measures that lower emissions from existing fossil fuels – can contribute to near-term emissions reductions, with the right incentives and safeguards.

…the report explains.

These fuels can be deployed with lower capital investment into established value chains as blend-in or drop-in solutions, serving as stepping stones to the future fuel mix.

However, rapid commercialization of new feedstocks and technologies is needed to ease supply constraints, reduce fuel emissions intensity and meet demand targets within the next 5-10 years. Despite the higher cost of clean fuels, blending strategies (virtual or physical) can limit the impacts on consumer pricing as markets mature and costs come down, while pursuing a portfolio of pathways.

Joint action to deploy proven solutions has untapped potential to accelerate the market.

Three insights emerge from success stories:

– Performance-based policies rewarding verified emissions reductions and other benefits have successfully embedded societal value in investment decisions. For example, in Brazil, tradeable credits, along with low-interest loans and tax incentives, have stimulated demand in support of energy security and industrial development. The success of such policies depends on interoperable standards and predictable market instruments to create revenue certainty where there is a credible path to competitiveness.

– Public-private mechanisms, such as double sided auctions or book-and-claim, pool risks and connect producers and customers where markets are sub-scale.

– Businesses partnering across the value chain can signal demand and potential supply, while rethinking how to contract, finance and allocate capital. This approach is proving successful in unlocking projects by bridging the gap between the market risks and infrastructure-type investment that characterizes clean fuel projects.

Over the last few years, the question among business leaders in the industry has evolved from should we invest, to how and when. We find that those who succeed generating value are rethinking how to approach projects focusing on customers, embracing flexibility and partnerships, and mitigating investment risk.

Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like the chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

Meet the projects

The projects that have signed grant agreements:

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction will provide a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport and fertilisers.

H2SITE Ammonia Cracking Solution

H2SITE is a Spanish scale-up company headquartered in Bilbao, where the core of its technology is designed and manufactured. From its industrial facility in Loiu (Bizkaia), H2SITE produces thousands of palladium-alloy membranes each year, which are integrated into membrane reactor systems enabling efficient conversion of hydrogen carriers back into hydrogen. In the case of ammonia, H2SITE has developed cracking systems capable of delivering high-purity hydrogen that can be supplied directly to fuel cells or blend in engines. This capability is particularly relevant for maritime and offshore applications, where operational reliability, system integration and fuel logistics are critical.

Norway represents a highly relevant environment for this technology. The country combines a strong maritime heritage with clear climate ambitions and a pragmatic, goal-oriented approach to innovation and first-of-a-kind projects. Norway is already assessing the use of ammonia onboard vessels in commercial operations. With a local presence, H2SITE aims to work directly with Norwegian shipowners, shipyards and technology partners to adapt its systems to real vessel profiles and operating conditions.

The decision to invest now is driven by risk management. H2SITE believes that the commercial and regulatory risks of delaying decarbonisation now outweigh the risks associated with adopting new technologies. Ammonia, when used as an energy carrier and combined with efficient conversion systems, offers a credible route towards zero-emissions vessels and long-term compliance rather than short-term mitigation.

H2SITE Norway AS has been established at a stage where the technology is already validated, and the focus has moved to product implementation. Since 2023, H2SITE has built and operated ammonia crackers for more than 6,000 hours, including extended continuous operation in relevant environments. Maritime-focused projects such as H2Ocean and APOLO have addressed integration with fuel cells and engines. In parallel, H2SITE is building MW-scale systems and has reached the manufacturing capacity required to support early commercial projects.

Achieving zero-emissions vessels across multiple segments remains challenging. Vessel types such as RoRo, bulk carriers, platform supply vessels and tankers face technical and operational barriers. While ammonia-to-power 4-stroke engines are approaching commercial readiness, challenges remain at low loads, including ammonia slip and the need for pilot fuel. Onboard cracking allows shipowners to benefit from liquid ammonia storage and established logistics while producing hydrogen that enhances combustion and enables the use of fuel cells for high-efficiency auxiliary power. Hybrid solutions, as well as full fuel-cell propulsion, provide practical pathways towards ammonia-fuelled zero-emissions vessels. Regulatory developments reinforce this direction. While global frameworks such as IMO regulations continue to evolve, FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System are already shaping investment decisions and will progressively tighten over time.

H2SITE Norway is positioned as a platform for collaboration. The next step is pilot and demonstration projects that allow systems to be integrated and operated under realistic conditions. “The technology is proven; the priority now is implementation of the product and operational learning,” said Tomás Crespo, Maritime Business Development Manager at H2SITE Norway. “We are looking to work with Norwegian shipowners and shipyards that want to take a measured, forward-looking approach to decarbonisation.”

Looking ahead, the coming year will be about projects and execution deploying systems in real operating environments, gathering operational data and refining solutions in close cooperation with the Norwegian maritime industry. This strategic initiative highlights H2SITE’s dedication to addressing one of the key challenges in maritime decarbonisation: enabling efficient and economically viable onboard hydrogen production. By making hydrogen available at sea for both propulsion and auxiliary power systems, we are actively supporting the transition toward a cleaner and more competitive future for the shipping industry.

The agreement sets legally binding rules for the sustainable use of ocean resources on the high seas. It applies beyond national jurisdictions.

The treaty covers marine genetic resources and benefit sharing. It introduces area-based management tools, including marine protected areas. It strengthens environmental impact assessments. It also supports capacity building and technology transfer.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez welcomed the milestone. He said countries had shown they can work together to manage the ocean sustainably. He added that IMO is ready to support implementation within its remit.

Shipping already operates under strict global rules. Environmental, safety, and security standards apply throughout a vessel’s voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 binding treaties to support sustainable shipping. Flag, coastal, and port State control enforce these rules.

Key IMO instruments include MARPOL, the Ballast Water Management Convention, and the London Convention and Protocol. These measures help prevent pollution and the spread of invasive species.

IMO is also developing a new binding framework on ship biofouling. The goal is to further reduce the transfer of invasive aquatic species.

The organization has adopted additional protections. These include Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas, Special Areas, and Emission Control Areas. IMO has also issued guidance to reduce underwater ship noise.

These assurances came to the fore on Tuesday 20th January when the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola, hosted the Ambassador of Denmark to Nigeria, Mr Jens Ole Bach Hansen, in his office in Abuja, using the occasion to strongly court Danish investors to Nigeria’s fast-growing marine and blue economy sector.

Welcoming the Ambassador, Oyetola described Denmark as a valued maritime partner and expressed Nigeria’s readiness to deepen bilateral cooperation in unlocking the enormous opportunities within the marine and blue economy. He assured Danish investors of a favourable investment climate, strong institutional support and promising returns in Nigeria’s maritime sector.

The Minister thanked the Government of Denmark for its support towards Nigeria’s election into Category C of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council in November 2025, noting that the achievement has further strengthened Nigeria’s standing in global maritime affairs.

He also commended Danish investment in Nigeria’s port sector through APM Terminals, which operates in the Apapa and Onne Ports, describing it as a strategic contribution to the modernisation and efficiency of Nigeria’s maritime infrastructure.

Oyetola briefed the Ambassador extensively on the Ministry’s ongoing reforms and initiatives aimed at harnessing Nigeria’s marine and blue economy potential. These include the development of a National Policy on Marine and Blue Economy, strengthened maritime security that has led to the elimination of piracy in Nigerian waters and a significant reduction of incidents in the Gulf of Guinea, port modernisation programmes, revitalisation of inland waterways, fisheries and aquaculture development, and conservation of marine biodiversity.

More than 90 percent of global trade moves by sea, with shipping alone accounting for nearly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) setting a net-zero target for the shipping sector, maritime nations are reassessing how economic growth and sustainability can be pursued in tandem. For developing economies like India, which rely heavily on maritime trade, port networks, and coastal livelihoods, this transition is challenging.

Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards.

Indian ports handle almost 95 percent of trade by volume and 70 percent by value, making them critical actors in climate action. India launched the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines in 2023 to make its blue economy sustainable, aligning port development with its Nationally Determined Contribution and the Panchamrit goals, which outline five climate commitments. As part of Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 and Maritime India Vision 2030, Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards. It aims to integrate climate ambition with development and trade, offering a template for other developing economies.

Global Net-Zero Shipping and Emerging Economy Limits

IMO’s revised GHG Strategy (2023) sets milestones for cutting emissions from international shipping “by or around 2050,” signalling a net-zero transition by mid-century. It calls for at least a 20-percent reduction, aiming for 30 percent, by 2030, and at least a 70-percent reduction, aiming for 80 percent, by 2040, compared to 2008 levels. In response, Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority is targeting a 60-percent reduction in its total port emissions by 2030, while introducing ammonia bunkering to scale alternative fuel use. Additionally, the Rotterdam-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor ensures that international partnerships cut emissions on the major trade route by 20-30 percent by 2030.

Emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness,

Unlike Singapore, however, emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness, which limit their ability to meet the IMO’s targets. In such countries, smaller ports are often overlooked in the pursuit of larger maritime objectives, while their older fleets risk becoming obsolete. Moreover, new rules on fuels and efficiency could impact the already strained trade routes. Despite their potential to adopt alternative fuels more rapidly than developed economies, the evolving regulatory ecosystem for safety and bunkering could inhibit their progress. Additionally, most green hydrogen and methanol projects, still at the pilot stage, may take longer to scale up.

India, with its national ambitions, its role on the IMO Council, and its focus on strengthening maritime presence, has an opportunity to offer solutions rooted in local realities through its green port framework. However, to achieve this, India’s Harit Sagar efforts will have to move beyond being mere guidelinesby ensuring investments in sustainable port practices, supporting coastal communities, and encouraging green innovation. Such a transformation will require accounting for local trade, population, and environmental needs, as well as overcoming the coordination challengesamong ministries, port authorities, state governments, and private operators, which can delay on-the-ground action.

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity.

India’s Framework for Climate-Resilient Port Growth

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity. The framework follows an ‘Eliminate, Reduce, and Control’ model, guiding ports in their everyday decisions towards carbon-neutral development without adversely impacting nearby marine ecosystems and coastal communities.

● Clean Energy Transition and Circular Economy

Harit Sagar encourages ports to adopt cleaner operations through solar and wind energy, equipment and vehicle retrofitting, electrification, and shore power for berthed ships. Ports must reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent per tonne of cargo by 2030 and 70 percent by 2047, while increasing renewable energy use. They are also expected to phase in shore-to-ship power, reuse all wastewater, and reduce freshwater use by over 20 percent by 2030. New Mangalore Port, which now operates entirely on solar power, is a strong example of these initiatives. The framework also focuses on efficient resource use by encouraging ports to streamline operations, reduce ‘idle’ time, and adopt energy-efficient technologies to lower carbon intensity. Additionally, the framework supports circular economy practices, such as efficient waste management, the reuse of dredged material, and waste-to-wealth initiatives, to help ports move towards zero waste while creating economic value.

● Scaling Renewable Energy Across Indian Ports

Harit Sagar prepares ports for future fuels, including green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, aligned with India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission. Ports are expected to increase renewable energy use to over 60 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2047. They must also upgrade infrastructure with specific targets to support offshore wind energy, LNG bunkering and EV charging, while promoting coastal shipping. For instance, Deendayal Port is planning 20 MW of solar and wind capacity; Visakhapatnam has 10 MW of solar; V.O.Chidambaranar Port (VOC) and New Mangalore are expanding their renewable installations. VOC has launched India’s first green hydrogen pilot for streetlights and EV charging, and is planning a green methanol bunkering facility. Ports are also implementing LED lighting upgrades, green building, electrified rail links, and plans for shore power to improve resource efficiency.

● Managing Water, Pollution, and Biodiversity at Ports

The framework considers ports as integral to the coastline and the nearby communities. It focuses on conserving shoreline and mangroves, mitigating air and noise pollution, using water efficiently, managing waste, bilge, and ballast water responsibly, and minimising the impact of dredging. It also considers recharging groundwater as a carbon sink, desalination, and rainwater harvesting. They set clear targets, including reducing freshwater use per tonne of cargo by over 20 percent by 2030, recycling or reusing all wastewater, and increasing green cover by more than 20 percent to strengthen biodiversity and coastal protection.

● Building Climate-Resilient Port Infrastructure

Harit Sagar emphasises the need for ports to prepare for climate risks by regularly assessing local vulnerabilities, strengthening infrastructure, and planning for challenges such as sea-level rise, cyclones, flooding, and coastal erosion. This approach acknowledges that ports must continue to function safely and reliably even as climate impacts increase, while aligning with international objectives. Mormugao Port in Goa, for instance, has been recognised as India’s first green port under Harit Shrey—a green incentive scheme for vessels. The port is listed on the global Environmental Ship Index as a model for promoting cleaner shipping and more sustainable practices across India’s port operations.

● Governance and Transparency in Green Port Systems

The parameters emphasise regular monitoring and reporting of port operations to prevent greenwashing and ensure compliance. Ports have to track progress under the Environment Management Guidelines and Environmental Performance Indicators, gradually adopting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative, within 6 to 18 months. Impact assessments and annual audits guide ports toward achieving targeted environmental, economic, and social goals. Harit Sagar encourages earning carbon credits and proposes incentives, such as priority berthing or reduced port dues for ships that use cleaner fuels or shore power. They also recognise private operators, public-private partnerships, and truck fleets that use cleaner fuels or electric vehicles.

● Linking Green Ports with India’s Blue Economy

Despite their potential to generate jobs and income, the unchecked growth of shipping, ports, fisheries, and coastal tourism without accounting for local realities can harm ecosystems and adversely affect local and indigenous communities. Harit Sagar must connect environmental protection and climate resilience with local aspirations and on-ground dynamics. Linking port development to livelihoods, ecosystem health, and meaningful community participation promotes innovative, inclusive outcomes. For example, VOC has already begun mangrove restoration by effectively involving local communities.

Implementing India’s Green Port Transformation

India is a major maritime nation. Through Harit Sagar and its work at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the country can demonstrate how ports and shipping can become greener while continuing to support development. The guidelines can also be gradually scaled up across ports nationwide. India could share its experiences with other emerging economies and SIDS, helping them adapt and implement green port transitions to diverse contexts. For international partners, financiers, and the IMO, Harit Sagar underscores the need for phased transitions, flexible approaches, and financing strategies adapted to varied capacities.

If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Realising Harit Sagar’s vision will require a careful, step-by-step approach involving all stakeholders. Monitoring must be more transparent and consistent, green finance must grow, and investments will be needed in skills and fuel infrastructure. These initiatives require engaginglocal communities at every stage. International platforms such as the IMO, G20, and BRICS can further support fair maritime climate policies. If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

After centuries of dependence on fossil fuels, the shipping industry is beginning a transition to cleaner propulsion systems driven by tightening climate commitments and regulations. The International Maritime Organization has set a target for net-zero shipping emissions by around 2050, while the EU’s Fit for 55 package brings shipping into the Emissions Trading System, requiring full emissions coverage by 2027.

In response, technological advances and regulatory pressure are accelerating investment in electric and hybrid vessels, with the global electric ship market expected to grow from $4.85 billion in 2025 to $18.39 billion by 2032.

7 key factors by WEF for a sustainable maritime ecosystem

#1 Technology neutrality with clean propulsion portfolios

No single solution will decarbonize shipping. Scaling zero-emission shipping requires a diversified mix of battery-electric systems for short-sea and inland routes, alongside alternative fuels and fuel cells for deep-sea operations.

#2 Safe, high-performance energy storage systems

Advanced energy storage is central to electric shipping, determining vessel range, charging speed, reliability and overall operational viability. Systems must meet stringent maritime safety standards while delivering commercial-grade performance.

#3 Retrofittable decarbonization pathways

Newbuild vessels alone cannot deliver near-term emissions reductions. With long vessel lifetimes, retrofitting existing fleets with electric, hybrid and low-carbon technologies is essential to accelerate impact at scale.

#4 Scalable port-side charging and energy infrastructure

Electric shipping depends on reliable, standardized port-side charging or battery-swapping solutions. Without widespread infrastructure deployment, adoption remains constrained by operational risk and cost uncertainty.

#5 Clean energy supply across the value chain

Zero-emission shipping requires ports and charging infrastructure to be powered by clean electricity. Otherwise, emissions are shifted from sea to shore, undermining climate benefits and public trust.

#6 Public-private collaboration and regulatory alignment

Governments, ports, shipowners, technology providers and utilities must co-invest, align standards and share risk. Coordinated policy frameworks and joint infrastructure development are critical to achieving commercial viability.

#7 First-mover leadership and early deployment

Early adopters play a critical role in proving technologies, de-risking investments and establishing viable business models. While initial returns may be limited, early action is essential to unlock scale and long-term market transformation.

World leaders from government, business, civil society and academia will convene in Davos 19-23 January 2026, to engage in forward-looking discussions to address global issues and set priorities. The theme this year is “A Spirit of Dialogue”. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues ranging from geopolitics and artificial intelligence to climate change.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-Economic-Forum-2026.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:57:02.838062

Interferry wants a pause on the further implementation of the EU ETS for the ferry sector, halting the planned increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent in 2026.
While Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry, it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding collected funds would be used for decarbonisation efforts.
This framework was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected.
“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry.","Global ferry trade association Interferry has called for an “immediate halt” to the further phasing-in of the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) for the maritime sector.

Interferry wants a pause on the further implementation of the EU ETS for the ferry sector, halting the planned increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent in 2026.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units a year in the EU. According to Interferry, every Euro increase in the freight rate risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks. While Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry, it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding collected funds would be used for decarbonisation efforts.

Interferry’s demand follows the EU Council’s decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS scheme, along with what it calls “the lack of clear regulations”’ on the distribution of the funds collected. In October 2025 the International Maritime Organization postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This framework was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry. “The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector.”

Johan Roos, director regulatory affairs at Interferry, said the exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an “immediate, severe competitive disadvantage” for ro-ro and passenger ferries.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs,” he said. “This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea. The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately €1 billion ($1.17 billion) per year, while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national Member State budgets. This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies.”",https://www.cruiseandferry.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/16049/InterferryEUETS_web.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 09:57:33.621278

“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said.
“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said.
“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said.
Our study in 2021 shows that starting around 2010, we observed a decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols and other aerosol species.","LAWRENCE — Cuts in sulfur emissions from oceangoing vessels have been tied to a reduction in lightning stroke density along heavily trafficked shipping routes in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, according to new research from the University of Kansas.

Previous studies had found frequent lightning along shipping routes over the Bay of Bengal before a 2020 International Maritime Organization rule capped sulfur in fuel used by oceangoing ships, leading to a roughly 70% drop in sulfate emissions in the Bay of Bengal.

“I think there are two reasons for this,” said lead author Qinjian Jin, assistant teaching professor of geography & atmospheric science at KU. “The first is the shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulfate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions. The second is that the Bay of Bengal is an area where we see lots of strong convection that is required for lightning to occur. I think both reasons contribute to the observed frequent lightning activity over this region.”

Jin said these two ocean regions best revealed the connection between shipping emissions and lightning. The KU researcher and his colleagues found lightning-stroke density — the number of individual lightning discharges, or “strokes,” per square kilometer — to be about 36% lower than before the 2020 IMO sulfur cap.

“The drop in sulfates from ships can cause fewer cloud condensation nuclei, larger cloud drops, weaker convection and storms, and thus fewer ice crystals and less frequent lightning,” Jin said.

The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate and Atmospheric Science. Jin’s co-authors were Jianping Huang of Lanzhou University in Lanzhou, China; Jiangfeng Wei of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in Nanjing, China; and Bing Pu, KU associate professor of geography & atmospheric science.

A similar drop in lightning strokes was detected along other busy shipping routes, according to their findings.

“There is another region very close to the Bay of Bengal, which is the South China Sea,” Jin said. “We see very similar enhanced lightning there. Another region is a very small area in the Red Sea. We see a very weak signal there, not as strong as in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea.”

The lightning data used come from a network called the World Wide Lightning Location Network, produced by the University of Washington.

“That network has been developed for more than a decade, starting in the early 2000s,” Jin said. “It provides very high-resolution lightning data. It is global data. Based on this dataset, the phenomenon of lightning decrease has been observed in those regions.”

According to Jin, sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, emitted naturally or from human activities, have two major climatic impacts.

“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said. “The other is modifying cloud microphysical properties, such as cloud droplet size and cloud droplet number concentration. By changing clouds, they can also influence radiation.”

Jin explained that once sulfate aerosols are released into the atmosphere, they can act as cloud nuclei, which is the mechanism by which sulfates released in ship exhaust can boost lightning strokes.

“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said. “When they’re smaller, it’s harder for precipitation to occur. Clouds can last longer in the atmosphere. With a longer lifetime, they have a higher chance to develop into high clouds, where ice clouds form. When we have more ice clouds, we have a higher chance of lightning. That is how sulfate aerosols can be connected to lightning.”

While the 2020 regulations on shipping were intended to clean up the air, the reduction in lightning can be seen as a side benefit, as lightning can be dangerous to mariners and equipment, and can hinder visibility and normal operations at sea. Jin said another consequence of the shipping regulation might be warmer global temperatures.

“Due to the 2020 emission regulation imposed by the International Maritime Organization, we observed a decrease in sulfur emissions from ships after 2020,” he said. “With less sulfate aerosol emitted from ships, we observed darker clouds over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Because clouds become darker, they absorb more solar radiation. Our previous studies imply that the decrease in shipping sulfate aerosols could be responsible for the record-breaking global warming temperatures in 2023 and 2024.”

Jin said his future research will aim to better understand this potential effect.

“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said. “Most current studies use modeling simulations with global climate models. One drawback of global climate models is their coarse spatial resolution, which have limited ability to resolve boundary layer cloud processes in the atmosphere. That affects the accuracy of aerosol impacts on radiation and clouds. In the future, I plan to use regional climate models with high spatial resolutions. These can resolve cloud formation, especially stratocumulus clouds, which are low clouds and very reflective. With high-resolution regional climate models, we can have a better estimation of the impacts of the decrease in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols on global temperature increase.”

Further, Jin plans to study the effects of regulations by nations in Asia that cut sulfate emissions beginning about 15 years ago.

“Based on our results, we know that with less sulfate aerosol, we could have less lightning activity,” he said. “This is a very important conclusion. During the past decade, many Asian countries implemented clean air acts to improve air quality. Our study in 2021 shows that starting around 2010, we observed a decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols and other aerosol species. This could result in less lightning in Asian countries. We have a plan to look at the long-term trends in lightning in Asian countries.”",https://news-archive-assets.ku.edu/data/c1/91/01kf464kb81nk8s8kttvvb7wg0.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 09:57:37.827412

The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector,” said Interferry chief executive Mike Corrigan.

More than half of the world’s gross roro- and passenger ship tonnage operates in European waters, transporting 400M passengers and 200M vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, stated Interferry, significantly offloading the road network. It added, “Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.”

Interferry said it supports decarbonising the maritime industry and accepted the EU ETS on the “clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included”.

The statement added, “The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the shortsea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, eg island communities, have to carry the full costs of ETS.”

“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for roro and passenger ferries,” said Interferry director regulatory affairs Johan Roos. “As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs.

Meanwhile, Interferry members operating to and from EU ports are taxed for their CO2 emissions without a clear provision on how the money is reinvested to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and without certainty when a global IMO regulation will come into force – if at all.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport, and fertilisers.","Six projects selected in the 2024 Innovation Fund Auction for renewable hydrogen production (IF24 Auction) have signed their grant agreements, receiving a total of €270.6 million, sourced from EU Emissions Trading System revenues. Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland, and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

Meet the new projects

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e., conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated up to €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction provides a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The European Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport, and fertilisers.

In addition, the Sub-Committee is expected to look ahead and plan future work on emerging technologies. Key among these are safety considerations for ships using new technologies and alternative fuels as part of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Delegates are tasked with developing a roadmap addressing the safe use of nuclear power for ships, wind-assisted propulsion systems, and batteries, recognizing the importance of early planning in the successful development of regulatory frameworks.

The Sub-Committee will also consider the outcome of the intersessional Correspondence Group on Underwater Radiated Noise (URN). Concluding advice to the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) on the URN Experience Building Phase will be an important step toward promoting the uptake and application of the Revised URN Guidelines.

Maintaining excellence and fostering innovation require the Organization to keep pace with advances in ship design and marine engineering. The Sub-Committee continues to play a critical role in providing regulatory clarity and a robust safety framework for both conventional and emerging propulsion and steering systems.

This review examines recent technological, regulatory, and market-driven developments in corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol production, with emphasis on advances realised between 2023 and 2025.

In corn ethanol systems, enzyme-enabled process enhancements have improved starch and fibre conversion efficiency, increasing ethanol yields without additional land use while simultaneously strengthening coproduct markets such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and biochar. Parallel progress in carbon capture and storage has enabled ethanol producers to enter voluntary carbon markets, reducing lifecycle carbon intensity and improving economic resilience.

In sugarcane ethanol, the integration of second-generation (2G) pathways using agricultural residues has expanded operational windows and improved overall resource efficiency, while advances in genetic improvement techniques have accelerated yield gains and climate adaptability.

These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors.

Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier. Understanding these converging drivers is essential for guiding future research, industrial deployment, and policy design in biofuel systems.

Introduction

The transport industry produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO₂ and methane.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. As a result, renewable and environmentally sustainable fuels are increasingly important.

Ethanol, derived from corn and sugarcane, is already widely used and, in some cases, mandated in the global fuel industry.

Corn and sugarcane are used to produce ethanol because they are rich in fermentable carbohydrates and have well-established production methods.

A factor limiting sugarcane’s global spread is the climate required for cultivation.

Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields.

These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.

Despite these developments, there remains a need to examine and consolidate the latest progress in biofuel technologies, particularly over the past three years.

Therefore, this review highlights the major technological and sustainability-driven innovations in ethanol during this period. Understanding these advances is essential for future research, global sustainability, and industrial optimisation in the sector.

Advances in corn-based ethanol

2.1. Enzyme and process enhancement

Over the past three years, significant effort has been directed towards developing techniques to improve yield without expanding land use.

Enzyme technology is a key solution: specific enzymes are now applied directly to the crop or during processing, boosting DDGS (distillers’ dried grains) and ethanol production by facilitating more efficient breakdown of plant material, as shown in Table 1.

This technology is estimated to increase overall ethanol production by 10% [2]. Crucially, these enzymes require only a financial investment, as no additional machinery or space is needed to realise these gains.

2.2. Co-product valorisation

With the rise in biochar production, used in carbon removal technologies, the supply chain was unable to keep pace.

This necessitated expanded intake to support higher production. The expansion focused on residues produced by ethanol plants, which began selling these materials.

Even with ethanol production “waste” being used in biochar production, by 2024 approximately 62% of supply had already been sold, with 28% presold for 2026. This raised prices and generated additional revenue for ethanol producers.

Not only has biochar increased in price, but DDGS has risen as well and is expected to grow by 7.3% from 2025 to 2030, as shown in Figure 1.

This increase in value can be attributed to several factors: governments have begun requiring and encouraging the use of DDGS in livestock nutrition through subsidies and awareness campaigns.

Another factor is price, which is estimated to be 10–15% lower than soybeans, another widely used livestock meal.

To meet this demand, industries have begun investing in machinery upgrades, such as fractionation systems that remove fibre and increase digestibility, now being installed in distilleries [3].

2.3. Carbon intensity reduction

One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits.

These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities.

In corn ethanol production, yeast ferments corn starch, producing ethanol, solids, and a high-purity carbon dioxide (CO₂) stream as by-products. The CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured.

Exhaust gas from fermentation vessels is directed to a capture facility, where it is purified, compressed into liquid form, and dehydrated to remove impurities.

The liquefied CO₂ is then transported through a flowline to an onsite injection well and injected into the Broom Creek Formation, a secure sandstone layer approximately 6,500 feet below the facility, where it is intended to be permanently stored [5,6].

Advances in sugarcane-based ethanol

3.1. 2G sugarcane

The integration of 2G production facilities with existing 1G mills involves using sugarcane residues, including leaves, bagasse, vinasse, and filter cake [7]. These residues are not fully utilised in 1G processes [8].

Including sugarcane bagasse also reduces the need for additional cultivation areas.

First-generation production occurs for only about nine to ten months per year. Including second-generation residues enables ethanol plants to operate year-round, thereby improving efficiency.

Investments in Brazil are also closely monitoring research into generating electrical energy from bagasse, as shown in Table 3 [9]. This could be essential for reducing future plant costs.

3.2. Genetic improvements

Genetically modified sugarcane traits aim to boost yield, pest resistance, and adaptability to new climates.

Methods such as CRISPR-based breeding and marker-assisted selection help improve traits while minimising unintended outcomes [10]. Classical breeding can take 15 to 17 years [11] and requires large quantities of plant material, much of which is wasted due to genetic or breeding failures.

With modern techniques, researchers can directly modify the genetic code of the plant, reducing the time required to achieve desired sugarcane traits.

Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption

More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12].

Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter.

In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13].

In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.

Future demand for water and air

Biofuels are commonly used in land transport but less frequently in aviation and maritime sectors. This is beginning to change.

Cargo ships have started blending biodiesel onboard [16], improving fuel properties and usability. Ethanol’s higher solubility in water presents additional handling considerations.

MIT researchers are also developing aviation fuel from biomass [17], creating another pathway for broader biofuel adoption.

Beyond regulatory drivers, expanding use in maritime and aviation introduces challenges related to fuel handling, moisture control, and emissions. Ethanol-based fuels are more hygroscopic than petroleum fuels, requiring improved storage and monitoring systems.

Integrated fuel management strategies, including controlled blending, adaptive combustion tuning, and real-time quality monitoring, will support safe and efficient use. These developments indicate that future biofuel deployment depends not only on chemistry, but also on infrastructure and operational co-evolution.

Market reaction

Biofuel companies are actively positioning themselves for future growth. INPASA, Latin America’s largest biorefinery company, currently produces up to 5.6 billion litres of ethanol annually [19].

It owns the world’s largest biorefinery and plans further expansion, investing nearly one billion dollars into facility upgrades [20].

Their actions demonstrate confidence in the sector’s future. Financial markets increasingly factor carbon intensity and regulatory alignment into investment decisions. ~

Producers demonstrating emissions reductions and coproduct integration are better positioned for favourable financing.

The market is shifting towards scale and integration, with larger facilities benefiting from economies of scale and improved logistics.

As consolidation continues, standardisation and transparency are expected to increase. These trends confirm that biofuels are transitioning from a niche option to a mature component of global energy systems.

Conclusion

Between 2023 and 2025, the corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol sector has made clear progress through increased production, stronger coproduct markets, and supportive policies. Enzyme technologies have boosted ethanol output by approximately 10%.

Biochar accounted for 62% of 2024 supply, with 28% already sold for 2026. DDGS prices remain 10–15% lower than soybean prices and are expected to rise by 7.3% between 2025 and 2030.

For sugarcane ethanol, second-generation processes now enable year-round operation. Policy changes, including Brazil’s ethanol blend increase and the EU’s renewable fuel targets, demonstrate rising adoption.

These developments show that the sector is becoming more efficient, environmentally responsible, and economically competitive. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders can use these insights to further accelerate progress towards low-carbon transport. These factors collectively explain the growth in investment observed in the biofuel sector over the past three years.

Shipping noise, largely generated by propellers and engines, interferes with navigation, feeding and communication for marine species that rely on sound, with marine mammals particularly exposed.

The Arctic, historically characterised by minimal human-sourced noise, is seeing a steady rise in acoustic pressure as vessel activity expands.

One submission before SDC 12 introduces new maps identifying migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. These corridors are recognised in IMO instruments as areas of special concern due to high concentrations of noise-sensitive species.

The material is intended to inform voyage planning during peak migration seasons in spring and autumn, supporting operational measures such as speed reduction and rerouting alongside technical ship modifications.

A separate paper examines potential underwater noise impacts linked to LNG tanker traffic associated with proposed LNG developments in the Gulf of California.

The analysis considers effects on resident and migratory whales, as well as related air quality and greenhouse gas impacts. The expected rise in tanker movements would introduce heavy traffic into ecologically sensitive waters, increasing risks from continuous underwater noise.

The organisations argue that the Arctic and the Gulf of California face parallel challenges: both regions historically experienced low shipping density, and both are now exposed to sharp increases that could cause irreversible harm to marine habitats.

18:00 - 20:00 CET (UTC+1) | In Person Event

International trading relies largely on goods transport by ships. The overall CO2 emissions are approximately 3 %. Similar to other industries and emission sources, these emissions need to be reduced.

The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has committed to achieve full climate neutrality for sea-going vessels by 2050. Inland waterway shipping must follow local regulations accordingly.

As sea-going ships are typically used for 25 years and inland vessels even longer, the greenhouse gas reduction can’t only be achieved by building new ships.

It is necessary to find solutions for existing vessels as well. Several technologies can be used, such as slow steaming, usage of renewable fuels like biofuels, methanol, ammonia or hydrogen, carbon capture, wind-assisted propulsion, hybridization and air lubrication.

This presentation gives an overview of the actual and future challenges of the shipping branch. It provides insights into typical maritime propulsion systems, alternative fuels and further applicable

“The 2015 Paris Agreement requires rapid scaling of clean energy technologies, but infrastructure bottlenecks could undermine major investment programmes.","Hydrogen transport infrastructure is developing at half the pace of other clean tech, putting net zero targets at risk, according to research from Heriot-Watt University.

A recent study from Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University found that while hydrogen production, storage and fuel cell technologies are advancing rapidly, the hydrogen distribution infrastructure is developing at half the speed, creating a critical bottleneck that could put billions in clean energy at risk.

The findings, published in the journal Sustainable Futures, are an important milestone in recognising that, while other hydrogen technologies improve and costs fall, distribution expenses could take up a large share of hydrogen system budgets, significantly limiting overall efficiency and growth of the hydrogen sector, the university researchers said.

The research team analysed 777,000 patents and 1.3 million citations spanning 182 years of hydrogen technology development, revealing clear differences in progress across the system.

The findings reveal where the hydrogen system is most vulnerable showcasing that pipes, terminals and liquefaction plants needed to move hydrogen safely and affordably are lagging behind.

As a result, the researchers said, “distribution is what links the entire hydrogen system together” and “without it, production stays concentrated near manufacturing sites”, meaning the “wider economy cannot make use of it and the climate benefits never materialise”, the researchers added.

Dr David Dekker, a research fellow at Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University and the paper’s lead author, said:

“Distribution will become the dominant cost in any hydrogen system. Even as we get better at producing and using hydrogen, getting it where it’s needed stays expensive.

“The problem is structural. Distribution requires massive pipeline networks and liquefaction plants that need billions in capital investment. Safety regulations and permitting processes are complex, so progress is slow.

“Most distribution infrastructure sits with a handful of major companies. They tend to share less knowledge than innovators in other hydrogen fields. In capital-intensive sectors where competitive advantage matters, companies are far less likely to publish innovations openly. This slows progress across the entire sector.”

Professor Dimitris Christopoulos who co-authored the findings is director of research for the Edinburgh Business School and Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Science, said:

“We cannot have a hydrogen economy without the infrastructure to move it around. Right now, that is the fundamental missing piece.

“The 2015 Paris Agreement requires rapid scaling of clean energy technologies, but infrastructure bottlenecks could undermine major investment programmes. The question now is whether policymakers and industry will act before distribution costs make hydrogen uncompetitive.”

Professor Mercedes Maroto-Valer who leads the UK Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC), said:

“As the BBC recently reported on Germany’s green hydrogen industry, hydrogen faces a classic chicken-and-egg problem: industry won’t commit at scale without pipelines, terminals and reliable delivery, but those networks won’t be built at scale without firm industrial demand.

“What this new Heriot-Watt research adds is hard evidence that distribution innovation moves much more slowly than the rest of the hydrogen system, so without targeted action to de-risk infrastructure, the distribution costs and uncertainty will keep holding the market back.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hydrogen-infrastructure-credit-Istock.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:57:11.406285

On the one hand, the US has moved with remarkable aggression to block the International Maritime Organization’s attempt to impose a global carbon pricing mechanism on shipping.

The rhetoric has been theatrical, casting the proposal as an inflationary “global tax” that would ultimately land on American consumers. Threats of retaliation, ranging from tariffs to port fees and even visa measures, have hovered over the negotiations, turning what is usually a technocratic UN forum into something closer to a trade skirmish. The message is clear: global levies dreamed up in London and Brussels will not be allowed to dictate costs to US industry.

Yet step away from the IMO chamber and the picture looks rather different. Domestically, the US is hardly in denial about the need to decarbonise shipping. The proposed Clean Shipping Act of 2025, with some remants of its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation, would push the sector towards net zero by mid-century through fuel carbon-intensity standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Washington is also enthusiastic about alternative fuels, particularly those that can be produced at home. Biofuels, including ethanol, are politically attractive because they align climate goals with farm-state economics, even if questions about scalability and lifecycle emissions remain.

Synthetic e-fuels sit comfortably within the US narrative of technological prowess, while green hydrogen and ammonia are treated as long-term strategic bets rather than near-term fixes. American diplomats are perfectly happy to champion green shipping corridors and initiatives such as the Clydebank Declaration (albeit a signatory before Trump’s inaugration) so long as they are framed as partnerships and pilots rather than tax regimes.

What looks like incoherence is better understood as a preference for control. The US is not rejecting decarbonisation; it is rejecting the idea that decarbonisation should be enforced through a global price signal beyond its influence. Washington would rather see markets shaped at home, innovation subsidised domestically and exporters given the chance to turn climate policy into an industrial opportunity.

The irony is that parts of the US fuel industry see the IMO framework as a gift, a ready-made global market for American low-carbon fuels.

To facilitate this transition, the availability of clean fuel supplies, along with adequate storage and bunkering infrastructure, is crucial. Transparency and stability in regulations will be essential for both producers and consumers of green fuels to ensure compliance with EU targets.

Madoqua, a Luso-Dutch company, is making strides in the Power-to-X (PtX) sector, aimed at producing and marketing hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and e-methanol. Central to their efforts is the Madoqua Green Fuels Terminal, a key infrastructure component designed to connect Portugal with Northern Europe.

In late 2024, Madoqua partnered with the Ports of Sines, Rotterdam, and Duisport to establish a green fuels corridor. They are collaborating with industry partners, including Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, to explore innovative business models and share risks in this energy transition. The company is open to partnerships that contribute socio-economic value and foster sustainable coexistence.

Current progress in developing the green fuels corridor includes the creation of an Ammonia Bunkering Operations Manual to facilitate the safe adoption of ammonia in marine fuel. Madoqua is concluding a feasibility study on the green fuels terminal in Sines, for which they have received support from the EU via the Connecting Europe Facility. While the ammonia storage component is advancing, the project faces challenges related to ensuring continuous product flow to stimulate demand.

Madoqua’s terminal will initially focus on ammonia storage and is based on an open-access model to unlock regional green fuel projects. Their green ammonia project has a phase one target of 500 MW of electrolysis capacity, with additional grid access secured for expanded production.

Regulatory frameworks such as the upcoming FuelEU Maritime regulation are poised to impact green fuel production and bunkering infrastructure significantly. A future demand for renewables in maritime fuels mandates a substantial acceleration in production capacity, as establishing new facilities is time-intensive.

Looking ahead, Madoqua sees opportunities for more green fuel corridors arising, particularly as EU support increases for public-private collaborations. The Global South is identified as a potential source for green fuel supply, particularly in regions like Morocco and Namibia, although core infrastructure development remains a barrier.

Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said.
The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe.
“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued.
Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.","Baltic Exchange on Tuesday (13 January) released an article by Carly Fields discussing methanol as a marine fuel, availability of low-GHG methanol and challenges in the development of e-methanol:

In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.

What remains missing is the economic bridge that allows shipowners to choose the green option without compromising their commercial viability. As Leisner concludes, the transition depends on how much of the fleet’s capacity is “actually used for low-GHG methanol rather than fossil fuels”. Until the price of carbon or the incentives for green fuel reach a tipping point, methanol will remain a promising solution waiting for the market to catch up to its potential.

Cargill on Thursday (15 January) announced the maiden voyage of Brave Pioneer, the first of five green methanol dual-fuel dry bulk vessels chartered by the company.

The deployment of the Brave Pioneer marks another important milestone in Cargill’s broader decarbonization efforts – one focused on innovation, testing and learning as the company works with customers and partners to refine future-ready solutions for Cargill and the industry.

Built by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Brave Pioneer is equipped to operate on both conventional marine fuels and green methanol, a lower-carbon alternative. The estimated CO2 saving of using green methanol compared to conventional fuel is up to 70%.

The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe. Through Brave Pioneer’s maiden voyage, Cargill will conduct a series of operational trials designed evaluate methanol bunkering readiness, understand how environmental attributes can be traced and verified through carbon accounting systems, and assess market appetite for low-carbon freight services.

“Decarbonising global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business.

“Technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, we have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what we learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.”

The launch of Brave Pioneer paves the way for the four additional vessels that will join Cargill’s fleet over the coming years. The addition of these vessels strengthens Cargill’s multi-solution decarbonization approach, which includes wind-assisted propulsion, voyage optimisation technologies, energy-efficiency retrofits and exploration of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

Each represents another step in the company’s broader efforts to embed sustainability into global ocean supply chains and support customers looking for practical, lower-carbon freight options.

“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued. “Our new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing us to switch to greener fuels as availability improves. It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk freight, Cargill’s actions send a strong demand signal to the market and serve as an open invitation for others in the maritime sector to join in advancing the transition to sustainable shipping.

The initiative supports Cargill’s broader effort to reduce supply chain emissions and invest and test practical innovations that advance progress toward a more sustainable global food system. Green methanol-enabled vessels—paired with the eventual expansion of renewable fuel supply—are expected to play a meaningful role in reducing maritime emissions over the coming decade

Classification society DNV on Monday (12 January) said the latest annual data from its Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform reflects a year shaped by regulatory uncertainty and market recalibration.

While overall newbuilding activity eased in 2025 following an unprecedented boom the previous year, its share of gross tonnage (GT) on alternative fuels held steady at 38%. This stability hinged on continued strength in the container segment, and is to a lesser degree also supported by orders in passenger vessels and PCTCs.

A total of 275 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in 2025, representing a year-on-year decrease of 47%. This mirrored a broader drop in the overall newbuild market, which fell to 2,403 orders, from 4,405 in 2024.

Despite this downturn, containership contracting showed resilience, rising to 547 new orders from 447 in 2024 and accounting for roughly 49% of all gross tonnage and 68% of alternative-fuel new orders. Within the container segment, alternative fuels dominated, with the fuel mix by tonnage approximately 58 percent LNG, 36% conventional fuels, and 6% methanol.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “While indicative of a turbulent year where strategic choices were harder to make, the slowdown in 2025 also reflects a natural reduction after several years of extraordinary ordering activity. Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains. Looking ahead, progress will depend on effective and global regulations that incentivize alternative fuel uptake, create a level playing field, and foster fair competition and implementation.”

Reflecting the container segment’s strength, LNG-fuelled vessels led the alternative-fuelled market across all ship types in 2025, accounting for 188 orders and representing 31 percent of total GT. Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.

LPG and Ethane tanker orders fell by 73 percent from 2024 to 2025. Similarly, bulk carriers, crude oil tankers, and oil/chemical tankers all saw pronounced year-over-year declines, reflecting a continued focus on cost efficiency and fewer immediate incentives for owners to commit to alternative fuels. Car carrier orders paused sharply after several years of strong activity, declining by 90 percent compared to the previous year.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty. We see them prioritizing investments where there is a strong alignment between fuel infrastructure, regulatory certainty, and commercial viability, particularly in container shipping, where LNG and methanol are supported by established supply chains and customer demand.

“In contrast, segments like bulk and tanker are more sensitive to market cycles and capital costs, leading to a preference for conventional fuels until further clarity emerges on fuel lifecycle emissions and regulatory incentives. Practically, this environment should encourage owners to focus on scalable solutions, invest in fuel flexibility, and adopt targeted energy efficiency measures that can be adapted as policy and market conditions evolve.”

Investment in fuel infrastructure continued at pace with 22 LNG bunker vessels added to the orderbook alongside new bunkering vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel. These developments signal growing confidence in LNG supply chains and emerging multi-fuel capabilities, reducing operational risk and supporting the economics of alternative fuel adoption.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) saw 24 ships delivered in 2025, with a total of 63 sails installed, slightly up from 2024, which saw 22 deliveries and a total of 49 sails installed.

The Greek Minister of Environment and Energy, Stavros Papastavrou, met with the Saudi Arabian Minister of Energy, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, at the conclusion of his visit to Riyadh. During the meeting, the two sides discussed cooperation between Greece, the United States and Saudi Arabia within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as well as their shared position on the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for shipping, which, as stated, has already yielded positive results.

To remind, the MEPC ES.2 meeting did not achieve the next milestone toward the entry into force of the NZF Instead, Saudi Arabia called for a vote at the end of the week to adjourn the process for one year. The motion was approved by 57 countries, representing a majority of those present and voting and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

As explained, Greece and Saudi Arabia agreed to work together through their respective Ministries of Shipping and Energy toward submitting a joint proposal on this issue before the new deadline for the adoption of the framework.

On shipping, we will of course cooperate first with our European partners, but at this moment there is an impasse. The energy transition in shipping has reached a deadlock at the IMO. Therefore, within the European framework, we are working together to shape a mutually acceptable and realistic solution—first at the European level and then with the United States and other interested countries over the coming year.

The pioneering creation is a major turning point in the transition to green shipping and in cutting the carbon emissions in the country's rivers and lakes. The module under which the vessel was created is the national Green Hydrogen Mission. With the use of an advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology, the vessel can generate the required power through a friendly electrochemical reaction, and only water is produced as a byproduct. The event is a testament to India's determination towards self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in clean energy innovation.

Market Statics

The Maritime India Vision 2030 includes over 150 projects with expected investments of Rs 3–3.5 lakh crore, having an earlier shipbuilding package of Rs 69,725 crore.

Maritime routes represent about 95% of India's trade by volume and roughly 70% by value, underlining the industry's significance to the nation's financial system and competitiveness.

Major seaports handled about 855 million tonnes of cargo in FY 2024–2025, indicating strong development in maritime trade and port efficiency.

India introduced a massive Rs 1.85 lakh crore NTPC Green Hydrogen Hub project, aiming to produce 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030, which would account for about 10% of the global market.

Incentives unveiled by the government, such as incentives of Rs 4,440 crore [USD 535 million] with 15 enterprises, have been granted a combined manufacturing capacity of 3,000MW annually under the electrolyser manufacturing incentive plan.

India's clean energy ecosystem by offering up to Rs 5 crore in funding support for green hydrogen R&D start-ups, out of a total of Rs 100 crore.

What is meant by a Hydrogen fuel cell?

A hydrogen fuel cell is a device that generates electricity as a byproduct of the conversion process of oxygen and hydrogen into water. This device is what prevents the battery from running out, as it continually pumps chemicals into the cell. It is frequently utilised in automobiles, power plants, and backup energy sources as a clean, effective substitute for combustion-based energy systems. Hydrogen fuel cells present a spectrum of benefits, including the fact that they emit absolutely no carbon emissions, as the only byproduct is water vapour. They function silently, having fewer moving parts than combustion engines, and are highly scalable, able to power everything from small gadgets to large power stations. Apart from that, they also contribute to energy security since hydrogen can be generated from various sources like water electrolysis, biomass, fossil fuels, and renewable energy.

Why does this type of vessel need to be in the shipping industry?

India has locally developed and launched its first hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel in Varanasi to promote green inland water transport, lower carbon emissions, and contribute to the net-zero targets by 2070. This zero-emission catamaran uses a fuel cell, which is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane device and emits only water; thus, it is in line with the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Cochin Shipyard Limited and the Inland Waterways Authority of India have developed it using fully domestic technology, which is a fine example of self-reliance, clean mobility scalability, reduction of logistics costs, and India being ranked among the global leaders in hydrogen maritime innovation, thereby facilitating the growth of the blue economy.

Ship Outlook:

India debuts in a new era of clean water transport with its maiden indigenous hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel. This 24-meter catamaran is tailored for the Ganga River's zero-emission operations in Varanasi. The heart of its propulsion is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (LT, PEM) fuel cell system that takes the stored hydrogen and oxygen from air and converts them into electricity, releasing only water vapour as the byproduct. Besides that, the vessel features a hybrid setup that integrates fuel cells, onboard batteries, and solar panels to ensure a steady power supply and improve the overall system efficiency. The vessel is fully air, conditioned and can carry 50 people with comfortable seating. Its service speed is 6.5, 9 knots (12, 20 km/h), and it can run for up to eight hours on a single hydrogen fill from four onboard cylinders. After meeting all safety requirements, the Indian Register of Shipping has certified the ship. It aids the urban transit system with a low draft suitable for shallow waterways, is operated by 10 crew members.

The Government Road Map for such Programs:

India is turning into one of the world's top hydrogen leaders quite fast. One can attribute this rise to the country's ambitious national policies, a lot of public and private investments, and India's firm commitment to decarbonization. India is planning to be the main hub for the production, consumption, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. India has set a landmark example for sustainable transport by introducing its very first indigenously built hydrogen fuel cell vessel in Varanasi. The event, which included the launch ceremony, was overseen by the Union Ministry, and the project is a manifestation of the government's vision to modernise Inland Waterways and promote eco-friendly mobility. In short, the IWAI, along with the Central Government, has been working towards the expansion of the navigational routes, upgradation of terminals, and has also commenced passenger and cargo services to reduce logistics costs and increase accessibility. This environmentally friendly vessel resonates with the national plans, such as Maritime India Vision 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. This project is the first step towards an ocean of hydrogen, fueled ships, thus enabling India to grow its blue economy and still rise as a champion against climate change.

Industrial Growth handshakes:

In September 2025, Oswal Energies announced a Rs 320 crore investment in green hydrogen infrastructure, focusing on production, storage, and transportation, with a 20 MW plant planned in Gujarat. The concept proposes the construction of a 20 MW green hydrogen facility in Gujarat within the next 12 to 15 months.

In July 2023, SFC Energy officially began production of hydrogen fuel cells in India, establishing a new manufacturing facility in New Delhi/Gurgaon in partnership with FC TecNrgy Pvt Ltd. In just six months, the production facility was constructed and turned over in collaboration with its Indian partner, FCTecNrgy.

,International Maritime Organization,2026-01-19 07:46:39+00:00,Manifold Times,Cleanship reports 81% reduction in black carbon emissions using biodiesel,Admin,,,,,https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/cleanship-reports-81-reduction-in-black-carbon-emissions-using-biodiesel/,"Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81% compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).
This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint.
Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand.
Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.
This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.","Danish research and demonstration initiative Project Cleanship on Thursday (15 January) said its new data, collected during real-world sailing, documented significant climate benefits from biofuel for the shipping industry.

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Soot particles – also known as Black Carbon – are among the most harmful emissions from shipping, both for the climate, where they contribute to global warming and melting of Arctic ice, and for public health through poor air quality. Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81% compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).

The measurements were carried out on the Uni-Tankers A/S ers vessel Falstria Swan, where an advanced online Black Carbon sensor from Green Instruments, developed in collaboration with Danish Technological Institute, made it possible to track emissions in detail and in real time during the vessel’s normal operation.

“We expected that biofuel would lead to cleaner combustion, but the magnitude of the reduction – especially at lower engine loads – is a very positive surprise. This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint. At the same time, the measurement technology allows us to monitor emissions with much greater detail than ever before,” says Simon Martin Spangenberg Bastrup berg, consultant and measurement specialist in alternative fuels and emission reduction at Danish Technological Institute.

For Uni-Tankers, the measurements translate directly into new, practical knowledge:

“The latest real-world sailing data on biodiesel (B100) give us a clear picture of both the black carbon footprint and actual CO₂ emissions. This insight is crucial for achieving our own reduction targets, while also contributing to better, data-driven recommendations for reducing emissions across the shipping industry,” said Troels Reppien en, Technical Director at Uni-Tankers A/S .

Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand. Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.

The results from the measurement campaign have now been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the form of a white paper. This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.

The white paper is scheduled for consideration at IMO’s 13th session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR), which will take place from 9 to 13 February 2026.

Brazilian state-controlled oil and gas producer Petrobras on Thursday (15 January) said it has entered into an agreement to supply bunker fuel with renewable content (VLS B24) to Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell.

Petrobras’ VLS B24 is a VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) composed of 24% biodiesel and 76% mineral oil produced at the company’s refineries. The product complies with international quality standards and holds the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – EU (ISCC EU), a global system that ensures traceability, compliance with sustainability criteria, and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the biofuel production chain, specifically designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

In addition, the fuel meets the requirements of FuelEU Maritime, a European Union regulation that mandates a progressive reduction in the GHG intensity of fuels used by ships calling at European ports, encouraging the use of renewable and low-carbon solutions.

“The commercialisation of VLS B24 with a company that has a strong international presence demonstrates Petrobras’ consistent progress toward a low-carbon market, in synergy with our 2026–2030 Business Plan. The initiative not only generates value for the business, but also enables concrete solutions in new energies and decarbonisation, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and innovation,” said Petrobras’ Director of Logistics, Marketing and Markets, Claudio Schlosser.

Supply will be carried out by dedicated barges from the Rio Grande Terminal (TERIG), where the product blending will also take place. The contract provides for the delivery of up to 12,000 metric tonnes (mt) throughout 2026.

The relationship between Petrobras and Odfjell, marked by a history of collaboration, gained new momentum with the joint initiative of the Brazilian and Norwegian governments to promote sustainable solutions in the energy sector.

“This movement resulted in the creation of a green corridor between the two countries, formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in February 2025, which encourages the circulation of vessels powered by low-carbon fuels,” Petrobras added.

Naturgy and Enagás —through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy— on Thursday (15 January) said they have reached an agreement to promote the decarbonisation of maritime transport in the Iberian Peninsula by building and chartering the state-of-the-art vessel Mistral LNG for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and BioLNG to all types of vessels.

The vessel will have a cargo capacity of 18,900 m³. Scale Green Energy, which began construction in early 2026, will operate the vessel, which will be chartered by Naturgy in 2028 under a long-term contract.

The Mistral LNG will operate, as its main market, in the Iberian Peninsula, which is being reinforced as a strategic hub in southern Europe for bunkering or supply of sustainable fuels, as well as in the area of ​​the Strait of Gibraltar and the Canary Islands, among other destinations in the Atlantic.

The ship will have a length of 138.8 meters, a dual-fuel engine, a service speed of 13 knots, and a range exceeding 4,500 nautical miles. Designed to supply LNG and bioLNG fuel, the vessel will be equipped with advanced technology to minimise emissions and optimise efficiency.

With this initiative, Naturgy positions itself as a strategic operator in the Iberian LNG and bioLNG bunkering market , which is projected to experience exponential growth in the coming years, and advances its commitment to driving the energy transition by offering competitive solutions to its customers. The company has extensive expertise in the energy supply sector and plays a key role in supplying Spain as the country’s main importer of natural gas.

For its part, Enagás—through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy—is consolidating its position as a major player in LNG bunkering in Southern Europe by adding this new vessel to its existing fleet of three ships: Levante LNG, Alisios LNG, and Haugesund Knutsen.

This contributes to the European strategy for reducing emissions in maritime transport and has a driving effect on LNG plants in Spain. All seven Spanish regasification plants are already equipped to supply LNG for bunkering, and those in Barcelona, ​​Cartagena, Huelva, and Gijón have already begun supplying BioLNG to ships and tankers.

This project will help meet the growing demand for alternative fuels in maritime transport and comply with new European regulations requiring a progressive reduction in emissions from marine fuels. In 2024, orders for LNG and bioLNG-powered vessels doubled compared to 2023, and LNG bunkering demand is expected to continue increasing steadily in the Iberian Peninsula in the coming years.

The BioLNG service, which has no associated emissions, uses the interconnected infrastructure from the regasification plants, so that the biomethane injected into the gas network is recognized as BioLNG —a liquid biofuel obtained by processing domestic and industrial organic waste—.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.","The European Commission has called for EU to stay united as some of its member states joined a US-led alliance opposed to a net-zero agreement.

Greece is joining Saudi Arabia and the US in negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Last week the Greek minister of environment and energy Stavros Papastavrou met with his Saudi Arabia counterpart, prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, at the conclusion of his visit to Riyadh.

The discussion referred to the cooperation between Greece, the United States, and Saudi Arabia within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the common position regarding the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) in shipping, which has already borne fruit.

Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate through their respective ministries – shipping and energy – towards submitting a joint proposal on this issue, before the expiry of the new deadline for the adoption of the relevant framework.

It is recalled that last October the IMO decided to postpone the decision to adopt the NZF for one year.

For his part, Mr. Papastavrou emphasized that Greece is “a voice of realism in Europe, when it comes to energy.”

The pushback from certain member states has cast doubt on whether the framework can gain the support needed to move forward, leaving the global shipping sector watching closely.

On Friday, a European Commission spokesperson was asked about the Greek government’s decision to break from the EU line on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and instead submit a joint proposal together with Saudi Arabia.

“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on the net-zero emission path towards 2050,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday, January 16.

“We are obviously ready to build bridges and to work with other partners to enable the adoption -when the discussion resumes at the International Maritime Organization Marine Environmental Protection Committee, and it’s very important that all EU Member States stay united in our shared International Maritime Organization goals,” the official added. “So to that end, we are looking into the news, and we are in contact with all the Member States and with the relevant authorities.”

A fierce Trump administration push to stop the global shipping industry from paying for its own climate pollution appeared to have been successful, as efforts to approve the “world’s first global carbon tax” collapsed.

It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted in October 2025 during the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee in London at the International Maritime Organization.

But after four days of tough negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months. The delay follows pressure and procedural tactics from the United States and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026.

The US president Donald Trump voiced its stance against the first of its kind global carbon tax, warning IMO member states to vote against the organization’s Net-Zero Framework aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector.

The United States threatened to use visa restrictions, commercial penalties, additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework and sanctions on officials to retaliate against nations that back IMO’s proposed carbon tax. The envisaged measures included potentially blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.

In this context, the Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias, in an official statement, underlined that “shipping needs international, fair and realistic rules, accepted by all member states, and not punitive mechanisms that will endanger the stability of global trade.”

The minister emphasized that “we agree on the framework, but we want realism. LNG has proven its reliability and must be utilized as a transitional fuel. We still do not have zero or near-zero emission fuels, not even to approach the reduction targets of the coming decade. The cost of the transition is very high, and a significant part of it must return to the shipping industry and the corresponding infrastructures.”

Some Greek shipowners, big names in the world shipping, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While Greek shipowners are investing in cleaner technologies, they remain wary of regulatory measures that could disrupt business models.

The Union of Greek Shipowners see the delay to reach an agreement on its Net-Zero Framework and the postponement of the decision as a “new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.”

Athens, while acknowledging the agreement’s flaws, it says “is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account,” the Union of Greek Shipowners said in its statement.

On the other hand, the delay on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework, is characterized by environmental groups as a “major setback” for global efforts to clean up shipping industry emissions.

As they say, governments will now have to spend the next months rallying every nation that supports the framework, and convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the “only sane way forward.”

Industry bodies were equally alarmed. In a joint statement, seven associations – Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, and Danish Shipping – warned that failure to adopt the NZF would leave the industry facing a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks.

“Binding global regulation is essential for achieving the goal of climate neutral shipping in 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field. The alternative to the Net-Zero Framework is not zero regulation, as some of the opponents of the agreement may wish for, but rather a complicated patchwork of regional and national regulations, which is entirely the wrong answer for a global industry,” said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of the trade and employers’ organisation Danish Shipping.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) also issued, among other leading associations and organizations, declarations of support for the Net-Zero Framework.",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SHIPS-GREECE-1024x536.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 21:56:23.572398

The administration of President Donald Trump plans to finalize 2026 biofuel blending quotas by early March, keeping them close to its initial proposal while dropping a plan to penalize imports of renewable fuels and feedstocks, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The information was reported by Reuters.

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA's plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an ""America First"" policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. ""As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize in the first quarter of 2026,"" the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency's small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas. The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA is considering a plan for refiners to offset 50% of the those exempted gallons.

The company announced on Jan. 15 that the vessel, Brave Pioneer, has entered service and begun its maiden voyage.

The vessel was built by Japan’s Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and is owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd. It is designed to operate on both conventional marine fuels and green methanol, providing operational flexibility as fuel availability and infrastructure continue to develop.

According to Cargill, using green methanol instead of conventional fuel can deliver carbon dioxide savings of up to 70%, depending on fuel sourcing and operational conditions.

Brave Pioneer departed the Philippines on Jan. 15 and will bunker green methanol in Singapore before sailing to Western Australia and onward to Europe.

During this initial voyage, Cargill plans to conduct a series of operational trials to test green methanol bunkering readiness, evaluate vessel performance, and examine how environmental attributes linked to low-carbon fuels can be traced and verified through existing carbon accounting systems.

The trials will also assess customer and market appetite for low-carbon freight services in the dry bulk segment.

“Decarbonizing global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business.

He added that technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, Cargill have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what they learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.

Cargill said four additional green methanol dual-fuel vessels will join its chartered fleet over the coming years.

Together, the vessels form part of a broader, multi-solution approach to reducing emissions across its ocean transportation activities.

This strategy includes wind-assisted propulsion technologies, voyage optimization tools, energy-efficiency retrofits, and ongoing evaluation of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

“We know the road to low-carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman said.

According to him, the company’s new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing the company to switch to greener fuels as availability improves.

“It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk vessels, Cargill plays a central role in the movement of agricultural commodities, including grains, oilseeds and feed ingredients, across global trade routes.

The company said its decision to deploy green methanol-capable vessels sends a clear demand signal to fuel suppliers, shipowners and ports, while encouraging broader collaboration across the maritime value chain.

Cargill added that it views the deployment as an open invitation to the wider shipping industry to participate in accelerating the transition toward lower-emission freight, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as dry bulk transport that underpin global food and agricultural supply chains.",https://millingmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ghana-rice-66.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:38.294154

When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said.
Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.
While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity.
Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said.","In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.",,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:45.402428

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA’s plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an “America First” policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher – an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. “As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize ‘in the first quarter of 2026,” the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency’s small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas.

The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.",,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:52.169618

For deep-sea trades that cannot realistically electrify because of energy-density and range constraints, e-methanol and e-ammonia produced from green hydrogen are widely regarded as among the few scalable options capable of delivering very low well-to-wake emissions.","A quiet but decisive shift is taking place in the race to decarbonise global shipping, and it is unfolding not in Asia’s massive shipyards or the traditional oil hubs of the Middle East, but across four European nations that have moved with unusual speed to build the infrastructure that could define maritime energy in the coming decades.

By Paul Morgan (gCaptain) – Spain, Denmark, Norway and France have emerged as the key frontrunners in developing production capacity for green hydrogen and synthetic fuels that deep-sea vessels will need if the industry is to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, according to Transport & Environment’s latest update to its shipping e-fuels observatory.

The research maps 80 confirmed or announced green hydrogen, e-methanol, e-ammonia and e-methane projects across Europe that could together produce up to 3.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent of e-fuels by 2032, assuming all reach operation. While this is still a relatively modest volume compared with current marine fuel demand, what stands out is the concentration of that potential in a handful of countries, creating a new geography of marine energy that could reshape where the world’s shipping lines refuel within the next decade.

Denmark stands out with fourteen projects that together could produce about 3.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent a year, spanning green hydrogen and its derivatives across multiple end-use sectors. Spain follows as the second-largest potential producer, with eight projects accounting for about nine per cent of total European volumes, closely linked to the country’s emerging hydrogen valleys and to major ports such as Algeciras and Bilbao.

Norway and France have smaller absolute capacity in the overall pipeline, but a notably higher share of their planned output is explicitly targeting maritime use. A significant portion of national volumes is intended to supply shipping at least in part: 100 per cent in France, 63 per cent in Spain, 53 per cent in Norway and 42 per cent in Denmark.

When the analysis narrows to volumes primarily dedicated to shipping, the picture sharpens. Nearly a quarter of Norway’s projected output fits that category, largely in the form of e-ammonia designed from the outset for marine use. Spain and France each have up to about 1.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of potential e-fuels that could flow into maritime bunkers if all relevant projects proceed, while Norway has around 0.13 million tonnes clearly targeting the sector. Denmark’s Kassø facility adds a further 0.02 million tonnes of oil equivalent dedicated to e-methanol, a portion of which is already being sold as ship fuel.

Denmark has already crossed a symbolic threshold that separates ambition from physical reality. The Kassø e-methanol plant, developed by European Energy and Mitsui and inaugurated in May 2025, is widely recognised as the world’s first large-scale commercial e-methanol facility. It has an annual production capacity of about 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol, powered by nearby renewable electricity and biogenic CO?, equivalent to roughly 20,000 tonnes of oil equivalent. Transport & Environment identifies Kassø as the largest European green e-fuel project dedicated to the maritime sector, with part of its output flowing directly to A. P. Moller-Maersk under offtake contracts for its dual-fuel containerships. In an industry that has spent decades discussing alternative fuels with relatively little hard infrastructure to point to, Kassø functions as proof of concept.

Behind this pioneering facility sits a wave of much larger national initiatives still working their way towards final investment decision. Denmark’s pipeline includes gigawatt-scale power-to-x schemes such as HØST PtX Esbjerg, which aims to use offshore wind and other renewables to produce around 100,000 to 140,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year, equivalent to more than 600,000 tonnes of green ammonia. Spain is pursuing a similarly strategic approach, linking e-fuel production to port-side infrastructure upgrades and regional industrial policy, while Norway’s focus on e-ammonia builds on its long experience in complex maritime operations. France’s smaller but highly focused portfolio reflects a deliberate policy choice to ensure that port decarbonisation and French-flag shipping are integral to the country’s wider hydrogen strategy.

For all the apparent momentum, Transport & Environment’s analysis is emphatic that the overall state of e-fuel development for shipping remains fragile. Less than five per cent of the identified capacity is linked to projects where shipping is the primary end-user, and only a handful of those have reached final investment decision or begun operation. Most schemes remain at planning or early development stages and are vulnerable to shifting economics, policy uncertainty and competition from other sectors for the same pools of green hydrogen and renewable power.

The European policy environment is therefore pivotal. Within the EU’s Fit for 55 package, the FuelEU Maritime regulation requires ships calling at EU ports to reduce the greenhouse-gas intensity of their energy mix progressively, reaching an 80 per cent reduction compared with a fossil baseline by 2050. In November 2025 the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan confirmed that at least two billion euros in Invest-EU finance would be mobilised for sustainable alternative fuels, including green hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and maritime. Those signals have coincided with an uptick in project announcements, but for many developers the lack of long-term, shipping-specific offtake certainty is still a major barrier to reaching construction.

The climate stakes are significant. International shipping accounts for roughly three per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and in 2023 the International Maritime Organization adopted a revised greenhouse-gas strategy that calls for net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050. For deep-sea trades that cannot realistically electrify because of energy-density and range constraints, e-methanol and e-ammonia produced from green hydrogen are widely regarded as among the few scalable options capable of delivering very low well-to-wake emissions. Yet these fuels are substantially more expensive than conventional heavy fuel oil and entail significant conversion losses. Without strong regulation, carbon pricing and targeted subsidies, they remain commercially unattractive for most operators.

The emerging leadership of Spain, Denmark, Norway and France therefore cuts both ways. On the one hand, it gives Europe a nucleus of industrial capability, port infrastructure and technical expertise that could anchor a genuinely global green fuels value chain for shipping. On the other hand, the work of Transport & Environment underlines how conditional that lead still is: a single operational, shipping-dedicated e-fuel plant in Kassø, a small cluster of other projects nearing completion, a much larger group still on drawing boards and a regulatory framework that does not yet send a strong enough demand signal to drag the majority of those projects over the investment line.

For shipowners and fuel suppliers trying to navigate the energy transition, the message is that the supply side of green marine fuels is beginning to coalesce in specific locations, but it will only mature if policy and market incentives align. For policymakers, the observatory functions as both a progress report and a warning against complacency. Without clearer and stronger demand signals in European and international regulation, many of the projects that currently place Spain, Denmark, Norway and France in the lead may never move beyond feasibility studies. The outlines of the infrastructure that could define maritime energy for decades are being sketched now in these four countries; whether they turn into steel and concrete in time to help deliver net-zero shipping will depend on decisions taken in the next few years about how serious Europe really is about forcing the pace of decarbonisation at sea.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_1901401.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:57:17.871593

Traditional marine fuels have dominated ocean transport for over a century, but mounting regulatory pressure and environmental imperatives are driving unprecedented innovation in alternative fuel technologies. Among emerging solutions, low-carbon ammonia bunkering has emerged as a critical pathway for achieving zero-emission maritime operations, combining proven chemical properties with scalable production capabilities.

Understanding Low-Carbon Ammonia as a Marine Fuel Solution

Defining Low-Carbon Ammonia as a Marine Fuel Solution

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering refers to the supply chain infrastructure and operational protocols required to deliver ammonia fuel to vessels equipped with dual-fuel engine systems capable of combusting ammonia for propulsion. Unlike conventional marine fuels derived from petroleum products, ammonia produces zero carbon emissions at the point of combustion, making it an attractive alternative for shipowners seeking to comply with International Maritime Organization emissions reduction targets.

The fundamental distinction between low-carbon ammonia and traditional marine gas oil lies in the production methodology rather than the combustion process itself. While marine gas oil generates approximately 3.2 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of fuel consumed, ammonia's carbon intensity depends entirely on its production pathway. This creates a critical classification system where green ammonia (produced via renewable-powered electrolysis) achieves near-zero lifecycle emissions, while blue ammonia (produced from natural gas with carbon capture) reduces emissions by 85-95% compared to conventional fuels.

Recent industry developments demonstrate accelerating commitment to low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure. The collaboration formalised between major fertilizer producer CF Industries, global trading firm Trafigura, and marine fuel supplier TFG Marine through a memorandum of understanding represents the most significant institutional commitment to ammonia marine fuel supply chains. This agreement specifically targets the US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe, two regions with established ammonia production capacity and strategic positioning within global shipping networks.

The Maritime Industry's Decarbonisation Imperative

Maritime transport accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, handling over 90% of international trade by volume. The International Maritime Organization's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 creates regulatory pressure that extends beyond voluntary commitments to mandatory compliance frameworks. These targets necessitate alternative fuel adoption across approximately 60,000 commercial vessels operating in international waters.

Furthermore, current regulatory frameworks include the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings, which establish baseline performance requirements for existing fleets. However, achieving IMO 2050 net-zero targets requires fuel solutions that eliminate carbon emissions entirely rather than incrementally improving efficiency metrics. This regulatory environment creates market demand for zero-emission fuels like low-carbon ammonia bunkering, particularly for long-haul shipping routes where battery technology remains impractical due to weight and energy density constraints.

In addition, the economic implications extend beyond compliance costs to include potential carbon pricing mechanisms, fuel availability guarantees, and insurance considerations for vessels operating alternative fuel systems. Early adopters of ammonia fuel technology position themselves to capture regulatory advantages while spreading development costs across longer operational timelines.

How Ammonia Bunkering Differs from Traditional Marine Fuel Supply

Traditional marine fuel bunkering involves transferring liquid hydrocarbon fuels at ambient temperature through established pipeline networks connecting shore-based storage facilities to vessel fuel tanks. This process relies on decades of standardised equipment, safety protocols, and crew training programmes optimised for petroleum-based products with well-understood combustion characteristics and environmental hazard profiles.

Ammonia bunkering requires fundamentally different infrastructure specifications due to ammonia's cryogenic storage requirements at -33°C and its toxic properties that demand specialised safety protocols. Transfer operations must incorporate vapour recovery systems to prevent atmospheric releases, continuous leak detection monitoring throughout bunkering zones, and emergency response capabilities specifically designed for ammonia exposure incidents rather than hydrocarbon spills.

The logistics complexity extends to vessel scheduling and port operations planning. Ammonia's lower energy density of 12.7 MJ/L compared to marine gas oil's 35.9 MJ/L means vessels require more frequent bunkering stops or larger fuel storage capacity, directly impacting cargo space allocation and route optimisation strategies. This energy density differential creates operational trade-offs that shipping companies must evaluate alongside fuel cost premiums and infrastructure availability.

Low-Carbon Ammonia Production Pathways for Marine Applications

Green vs. Blue Ammonia Production Pathways

Green ammonia production utilises renewable electricity to power electrolysis systems that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, subsequently combining the hydrogen with nitrogen through the Haber-Bosch synthesis process. This pathway achieves near-zero carbon intensity when powered by wind, solar, or hydroelectric sources with minimal embedded carbon footprints. However, green ammonia production faces scalability constraints due to renewable energy availability and electrolyser manufacturing capacity limitations.

Blue ammonia production leverages existing natural gas infrastructure and industrial ammonia facilities whilst incorporating carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to reduce emissions. CF Industries' planned Louisiana facility demonstrates this approach, designed to capture up to 95% of CO2 emissions from a 1.4 million tonnes per year ammonia production facility scheduled for 2030 operation. This specification substantially exceeds typical carbon capture rates in industrial applications, reducing carbon intensity from approximately 1.5-2.0 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia to 0.075-0.15 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia.

The production pathway selection carries implications beyond carbon intensity metrics. Moreover, green ammonia requires dedicated renewable energy allocation that competes with grid decarbonisation priorities, while blue ammonia depends on geological carbon storage verification and regulatory acceptance of CCS permanence guarantees. Economic considerations include renewable energy procurement costs, carbon capture infrastructure amortisation, and regulatory incentive monetisation through tax credits and carbon offset markets, aligning with broader decarbonisation benefits across industrial sectors.

Carbon Intensity Metrics and Certification Standards

Carbon intensity measurement in ammonia production encompasses lifecycle assessment methodologies that account for energy inputs, process emissions, and upstream supply chain impacts. Traditional grey ammonia production generates 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of ammonia, establishing the baseline against which low-carbon alternatives are measured. Blue ammonia with 95% carbon capture achieves approximately 0.075 to 0.15 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia, whilst green ammonia powered by renewable electricity approaches near-zero emissions.

Certification frameworks remain under development by regulatory bodies and industry organisations seeking to establish transparent benchmarking standards. The verification process must address production methodology documentation, energy source verification, carbon capture permanence validation, and supply chain traceability requirements. Current industry practices include third-party verification agencies that audit production facilities and issue certificates enabling low-carbon claims for commercial transactions.

CF Industries' strategy of monetising greenhouse gas abatement efforts through tax credits and carbon credits demonstrates how production economics increasingly factor regulatory incentive mechanisms beyond commodity price differentials. This approach suggests future low-carbon ammonia bunkering cost structures will reflect carbon pricing mechanisms, creating complex interdependencies with shipping carbon markets, carbon credit valuations, and tax policy frameworks.

Integration with Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Low-carbon ammonia production requires substantial renewable energy capacity allocation, creating competition with grid decarbonisation initiatives and industrial electrification programmes. Green ammonia facilities typically require 28-35 MWh of renewable electricity per tonne of ammonia produced, necessitating dedicated renewable energy projects or long-term power purchase agreements with wind and solar developers.

The geographic distribution of optimal renewable resources influences ammonia production location decisions and subsequent transportation logistics to bunkering hubs. Coastal regions with excellent wind resources and proximity to shipping routes offer advantages for integrated production and bunkering facilities, while inland renewable resources may require additional transportation infrastructure to reach marine fuel terminals.

Furthermore, blue ammonia production integration focuses on carbon capture infrastructure rather than renewable energy procurement. Facilities must develop geological storage agreements, CO2 transportation systems, and monitoring frameworks to ensure permanent carbon sequestration. The economic viability depends on carbon credit pricing, regulatory permanence requirements, and geological storage capacity availability in proximity to production facilities, reflecting broader challenges facing the Canada energy transition.

Technical Infrastructure Requirements for Ammonia Bunkering

Storage and Handling System Specifications

Ammonia bunkering infrastructure demands cryogenic storage systems capable of maintaining -33°C temperatures whilst managing boil-off gas recovery and pressure relief operations. Shore-based terminals require insulated tank systems with specialised materials compatible with liquid ammonia's corrosive properties under cryogenic conditions. These systems must incorporate continuous circulation pumps, automated temperature monitoring, and vapour recovery equipment to minimise atmospheric emissions during storage periods.

Parameter Marine Gas Oil Low-Carbon Ammonia Storage Temperature Ambient -33°C Energy Density (MJ/L) 35.9 12.7 Carbon Emissions High Zero (at point of use) Toxicity Level Low High (requires specialised handling)

Transfer system specifications include cryogenic-rated piping with thermal expansion joints, automated flow control valves, and emergency shutdown systems activated by leak detection sensors. Port terminals must install vapour recovery networks capable of capturing ammonia gas releases during transfer operations and either re-liquefying recovered vapour or routing it to industrial users. The infrastructure investment extends beyond terminal equipment to include specialised loading arms, hose connections rated for cryogenic service, and vessel mooring systems designed for extended bunkering operations.

Vessel-side modifications require installation of cryogenic fuel tanks integrated with dual-fuel engine systems capable of combusting both ammonia and conventional backup fuels. Tank insulation systems must maintain cryogenic temperatures during extended voyages whilst incorporating pressure relief systems that safely vent boil-off gas overboard when necessary. Engine room ventilation systems require enhancement to prevent ammonia accumulation in enclosed spaces, with continuous gas detection monitoring throughout fuel storage and distribution areas.

Safety Protocols and Risk Management Frameworks

Ammonia's toxicity profile creates fundamentally different safety requirements compared to conventional marine fuel handling. Ammonia gas is heavier than air and can accumulate in low-lying spaces, creating exposure hazards that require continuous atmospheric monitoring in engine rooms, pump rooms, and fuel storage compartments. Emergency response protocols must address ammonia exposure treatment, including immediate medical intervention procedures and evacuation protocols for affected personnel.

Fire suppression systems require specific rating for liquid cryogenic ammonia fires, which behave differently than hydrocarbon fuel fires. Water spray systems designed for ammonia incidents focus on vapour suppression and cooling rather than combustion suppression, requiring specialised nozzle configurations and pressure specifications. Port emergency response planning must coordinate with local fire departments and medical facilities to ensure appropriate treatment capabilities for ammonia exposure incidents.

Personal protective equipment specifications include self-contained breathing apparatus rated for ammonia environments, chemical-resistant clothing systems, and emergency eyewash stations positioned throughout bunkering areas. Crew training requirements extend beyond standard marine fuel handling to include ammonia-specific hazard recognition, exposure prevention protocols, and emergency response procedures. These safety investments represent significant operational cost increases but are essential for regulatory approval and insurance coverage.

Port Infrastructure Adaptation Requirements

Existing port infrastructure adaptation involves significant capital expenditure for cryogenic handling capabilities, with costs varying substantially between new terminal construction and existing facility retrofitting. Ports with established LNG bunkering infrastructure possess some cryogenic expertise but require ammonia-specific equipment modifications due to different temperature requirements and toxicity considerations.

System Component Modification Type Cost Impact Fuel Storage Cryogenic tanks required High Engine Systems Dual-fuel conversion Medium-High Safety Equipment Enhanced ventilation/detection Medium Crew Training Specialised certification Low-Medium

Environmental permitting processes require comprehensive risk assessments addressing atmospheric emissions, groundwater protection, and emergency response capabilities. Regulatory authorities evaluate ammonia handling protocols, leak detection systems, and community safety measures before approving bunkering operations. This approval process can extend project timelines by 12-18 months beyond typical marine fuel terminal development schedules.

Integration with existing port vessel traffic management systems requires coordination protocols for low-carbon ammonia bunkering operations, including dedicated berthing areas, specialised tugboat assistance, and extended transfer timeframes. Port authorities must develop ammonia-specific operational procedures that address weather restrictions, emergency evacuation procedures, and coordination with other port activities during bunkering operations.

Global Port Leadership in Ammonia Bunkering Development

Port of Rotterdam's Pioneering Infrastructure Programmes

The Port of Rotterdam currently operates at Port Readiness Level 6 within the seven-stage PRL assessment system, positioning it as the most advanced European port for ammonia bunkering capability. This achievement reflects systematic infrastructure development including pilot bunkering programmes designed to validate safety protocols before commercial deployment. Rotterdam's approach demonstrates the multi-year development pathway required for ammonia bunkering readiness, with commercial operations targeted for 2030-2033.

Rotterdam's progression leverages the Netherlands' established ammonia handling expertise from industrial and fertiliser sectors, combined with its position as Europe's largest port and strategic location within major shipping routes. The port's existing LNG bunkering infrastructure provides foundational cryogenic handling capabilities that can be adapted for ammonia applications, though significant modifications remain necessary for ammonia-specific requirements.

The Port Readiness Level (PRL) system evaluates ammonia bunkering capability across seven stages, from initial concept (PRL 1) to full commercial deployment (PRL 7). Rotterdam currently operates at PRL 6, with commercial readiness expected by 2030-2033.

Investment commitments from Rotterdam port authority include dedicated ammonia storage terminals, specialised transfer equipment, and enhanced safety systems designed for toxic gas handling. The port's development strategy emphasises coordination with existing industrial users of ammonia, enabling shared infrastructure utilisation and economies of scale across fertiliser, chemical, and marine fuel applications.

Strategic Regional Hub Development

The CF Industries, Trafigura, and TFG Marine collaboration specifically targets the US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe as initial deployment regions, reflecting strategic positioning within existing ammonia production and global shipping networks. This geographic focus demonstrates industry recognition that low-carbon ammonia bunkering development will concentrate in established ammonia-handling regions before expanding to other maritime hubs.

US Gulf Coast advantages include proximity to CF Industries' Donaldsonville plant in Louisiana, currently the largest ammonia and nitrogen production facility globally. This existing infrastructure provides production capacity that can be redirected toward marine fuel applications without requiring entirely new manufacturing facilities. The region's established ammonia export infrastructure for fertiliser markets offers logistics networks that can be adapted for marine fuel distribution.

Northwest European ports benefit from established ammonia import infrastructure serving industrial and agricultural markets, creating existing handling expertise and storage capacity. The region's regulatory alignment with European Union maritime decarbonisation policies provides policy support for alternative fuel infrastructure investment, whilst established shipping routes connecting to major global trade lanes offer immediate market opportunities for ammonia-fuelled vessels.

Strategic Partnership Models for Infrastructure Development

TFG Marine's specialised role in the three-party collaboration demonstrates the emergence of dedicated marine fuel companies focused specifically on alternative fuel bunkering rather than traditional general cargo terminal operations. TFG Marine, with Trafigura holding a 75% ownership stake, concentrates on last-mile delivery systems and establishing ammonia bunkering hubs across strategic port locations.

This partnership structure illustrates multi-stakeholder value chain integration: CF Industries provides production capacity and low-carbon certification capabilities, Trafigura offers global trading networks and market access, whilst TFG Marine delivers specialised bunkering infrastructure and operational expertise. The coordinated approach addresses production, trading, and delivery requirements through dedicated expertise rather than attempting vertical integration within individual companies.

Additionally, industry partnerships focus on stakeholder engagement and bunkering logistics planning as foundational activities, suggesting that port development requires coordinated industry initiatives rather than individual port authority investments. This collaborative approach enables risk sharing across multiple participants whilst leveraging specialised expertise from production, trading, and marine fuel sectors, providing valuable energy security insights for supply chain resilience.

Critical Safety Considerations for Ammonia Marine Operations

Toxicity Risk Management and Emergency Response

Ammonia's acute toxicity represents the primary safety challenge distinguishing it from conventional marine fuels, which present primarily combustion and explosion hazards. Even small leaks or spills can create immediate health risks requiring specialised emergency response protocols, medical treatment capabilities, and evacuation procedures fundamentally different from hydrocarbon fuel incidents.

Continuous atmospheric monitoring systems must be installed throughout vessels and port facilities to detect ammonia concentrations before they reach hazardous levels. Detection equipment requires calibration for ammonia-specific sensors with automatic alarm systems connected to emergency response protocols. Port facilities need strategically positioned emergency eyewash stations, medical treatment areas, and communication systems enabling immediate coordination with local healthcare facilities experienced in ammonia exposure treatment.

Personal protective equipment specifications include self-contained breathing apparatus specifically rated for ammonia environments, chemical-resistant clothing systems, and emergency respiratory protection readily accessible throughout bunkering operations. Training programmes must address ammonia exposure symptoms, immediate treatment protocols, and evacuation procedures that account for ammonia's tendency to accumulate in low-lying areas due to its density characteristics.

International Maritime Organization Guidelines and Compliance

International Maritime Organization guidelines for ammonia marine fuel operations remain under active development as regulatory frameworks adapt to alternative fuel technologies. Current provisional guidelines address vessel design standards, crew certification requirements, and operational procedures, but comprehensive regulations are still being finalised through international consultation processes.

Vessel certification requirements include demonstration of dual-fuel engine capabilities, cryogenic fuel storage system compliance, and enhanced safety equipment installation. Flag state authorities must approve ammonia fuel systems before vessels can operate commercially, creating potential delays for early adopters whilst regulatory frameworks are standardised across jurisdictions.

Port state control inspections will require specialised expertise to evaluate ammonia fuel systems, necessitating inspector training programmes and updated inspection protocols. Insurance providers are developing coverage frameworks for ammonia-fuelled vessels, with premium structures reflecting the additional risks associated with toxic fuel handling compared to conventional marine fuels.

Crew Training and Certification Requirements

Specialised certification programmes are being developed to address ammonia fuel handling, requiring crew members to complete training modules covering toxicity awareness, emergency response procedures, and operational safety protocols specific to cryogenic ammonia systems. These requirements extend beyond existing marine fuel handling certifications to include hazardous material handling credentials.

Training curricula must address ammonia's unique properties including its density characteristics, exposure symptoms, and appropriate response procedures for different types of incidents. Practical training components include proper use of personal protective equipment, operation of ammonia detection systems, and coordination with shore-based emergency response teams during bunkering operations.

Certification renewal requirements ensure crew competency is maintained through regular refresher training and practical assessments. The specialised nature of low-carbon ammonia bunkering fuel handling may create crew recruitment challenges as the industry scales, potentially requiring enhanced compensation packages and career development programmes to attract qualified personnel.

Ammonia-Fuelled Vessel Technology and Performance Characteristics

Engine Technology and Dual-Fuel Capabilities

Modern ammonia-capable marine engines utilise dual-fuel technology enabling operation on both ammonia and conventional backup fuels, providing operational flexibility during the infrastructure development phase. These engines require specialised combustion chamber designs to accommodate ammonia's different flame characteristics and ignition properties compared to conventional marine fuels.

Trafigura currently has four ammonia-fuelled gas carriers (MGCs) on order, with all deliveries scheduled by 2028, demonstrating near-term vessel availability aligned with infrastructure development timelines. These vessels represent concrete fleet commitment from a major global trading firm, indicating confidence in ammonia fuel viability for marine applications beyond theoretical development phases.

Engine efficiency optimisation for ammonia fuel requires sophisticated control systems managing fuel injection timing, combustion air mixing, and exhaust gas treatment to minimise nitrogen oxide emissions whilst maintaining power output comparable to conventional fuels. Advanced engine management systems automatically adjust operational parameters based on fuel type selection, enabling seamless transitions between ammonia and backup fuels during voyages.

Vessel Design Modifications and Space Requirements

Cryogenic fuel storage systems require substantial vessel design modifications including insulated tank installations, specialised piping networks, and enhanced ventilation systems throughout fuel-related compartments. Tank placement must balance weight distribution, thermal insulation requirements, and accessibility for maintenance operations whilst maximising cargo space utilisation.

Fuel system integration involves installing ammonia supply lines from storage tanks to engine rooms with appropriate thermal expansion joints, automatic shutoff valves, and continuous leak detection monitoring. Ventilation systems require enhancement to prevent ammonia accumulation in enclosed spaces, with forced ventilation maintaining positive pressure differentials that direct any leaks toward safe venting areas.

Safety system installations include enhanced fire suppression equipment rated for cryogenic ammonia incidents, emergency fuel dump systems enabling rapid tank venting in emergency situations, and communication systems providing continuous monitoring of fuel system status from bridge operations. These modifications represent significant capital investment beyond conventional vessel construction costs.

Operational Range and Bunkering Frequency Implications

Ammonia's energy density of 12.7 MJ/L compared to marine gas oil's 35.9 MJ/L creates a 65% reduction in energy density that directly impacts vessel operational range and cargo capacity trade-offs. Vessels require either more frequent bunkering stops or larger fuel storage installations, both of which affect operational economics and route planning strategies.

Timeline Market Milestone Expected Capacity 2025-2027 Pilot Operations Limited commercial trials 2028-2030 Early Commercial Regional route coverage 2030-2035 Scale-Up Phase Major shipping lanes 2035-2050 Full Deployment 35-50% marine fuel share

Route optimisation requires coordination with low-carbon ammonia bunkering hub availability, potentially concentrating initial adoption on shorter regional routes with established infrastructure before expanding to trans-oceanic services. Shipping schedules must accommodate extended bunkering times due to cryogenic transfer requirements and enhanced safety protocols during fuel transfer operations.

Fleet planning considerations include vessel assignment strategies that match ammonia-capable ships with routes offering reliable bunkering infrastructure, backup fuel availability for emergency situations, and coordination with cargo scheduling to optimise fuel efficiency across different operational profiles.

Market Dynamics Driving Ammonia Bunkering Adoption

Regulatory Pressures and IMO 2050 Net-Zero Targets

The International Maritime Organization's commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 creates mandatory compliance frameworks extending beyond voluntary environmental commitments to legally binding emissions reduction requirements. These targets necessitate alternative fuel adoption across the global commercial fleet, with interim reduction milestones creating near-term pressure for early alternative fuel deployment.

Current regulatory instruments including the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) establish baseline performance requirements, but achieving 2050 net-zero targets requires fuel solutions that eliminate emissions entirely rather than incrementally improving efficiency metrics. This regulatory trajectory creates market certainty for zero-emission fuels like low-carbon ammonia bunkering, particularly for shipping segments where electrification remains impractical due to weight and energy density constraints.

Regional regulatory initiatives including European Union emissions trading system expansion to maritime transport and potential carbon border adjustment mechanisms create additional compliance costs for vessels operating conventional fuels. These policy frameworks provide economic incentives for alternative fuel adoption through carbon pricing mechanisms that improve the relative competitiveness of low-carbon ammonia compared to conventional marine fuels.

Economic Incentives and Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

CF Industries' strategy of monetising greenhouse gas abatement efforts through tax credits and carbon credits demonstrates how production economics increasingly incorporate regulatory incentive mechanisms beyond traditional commodity pricing. This approach creates complex interdependencies between ammonia production costs, carbon credit market values, and tax policy frameworks that influence fuel pricing structures.

Carbon pricing mechanisms in shipping markets are evolving through emissions trading systems, fuel levy proposals, and carbon offset requirements that create direct economic advantages for zero-emission fuels. Early market development may require carbon price supports or regulatory mandates to bridge cost competitiveness gaps during infrastructure development phases.

Furthermore, investment incentive programmes including government subsidies for alternative fuel infrastructure, loan guarantee programmes for vessel retrofitting, and research development grants for technology advancement reduce capital barriers for early adopters. These support mechanisms enable first-mover investments whilst spreading development costs across multiple stakeholders through public-private partnership structures, supporting broader investment strategies across the energy transition.

Shipowner Investment Strategies and Fleet Planning

Fleet investment strategies must balance alternative fuel technology adoption with operational flexibility during infrastructure development phases. Dual-fuel capable vessels provide operational security through conventional fuel backup systems whilst positioning fleets for alternative fuel adoption as infrastructure availability expands across global shipping routes.

The timing of vessel orders requires coordination with infrastructure development timelines to ensure fuel availability aligns with delivery schedules. Trafigura's commitment to four ammonia-fuelled gas carriers delivered by 2028 demonstrates strategic coordination between fleet investment and expected infrastructure readiness timelines in target operational regions.

Investment payback calculations must incorporate carbon compliance costs, fuel price differentials, potential operational restrictions in emissions control areas, and insurance premium variations between conventional and alternative fuel vessels. Long-term fleet planning requires scenario analysis addressing different rates of infrastructure deployment and regulatory framework evolution across global shipping markets.

Industry Value Chain Development and Partnership Models

Fertiliser Producers Expanding into Marine Fuel Markets

Traditional ammonia producers possess established manufacturing infrastructure, technical expertise, and global distribution networks that can be redirected toward marine fuel applications with appropriate modifications. CF Industries' Donaldsonville facility represents this strategic pivot, utilising existing production capacity whilst developing low-carbon certification capabilities specifically for marine fuel markets.

The 1.4 million tonnes per year ammonia project with 95% CO2 capture demonstrates how fertiliser producers can leverage industrial-scale infrastructure for marine fuel supply whilst maintaining core agricultural market service. This dual-market approach enables economies of scale across applications whilst providing revenue diversification opportunities during maritime fuel market development phases.

Production capacity allocation between fertiliser and marine fuel markets requires flexible manufacturing systems capable of responding to seasonal demand variations in agriculture whilst meeting consistent marine fuel supply commitments. Strategic inventory management and production scheduling become critical capabilities for producers serving both market segments simultaneously, reflecting broader manufacturing strategies within green metals leadership initiatives.

Trading Firms and Logistics Partnership Models

Global trading firms like Trafigura provide essential market access and risk management capabilities connecting ammonia producers with end-user shipping companies through established commodity trading networks. These firms possess global logistics expertise, customer relationships, and financial resources necessary for developing new fuel supply chains across multiple geographic regions.

Trading firm involvement enables producers to focus on manufacturing optimisation whilst delegating market development, customer service, and logistics coordination to specialised trading operations. This division of capabilities allows each participant to leverage core competencies whilst sharing development risks across multiple stakeholders.

Recent industry partnerships demonstrate integrated value chain development, combining ammonia production capabilities, global trading networks, and specialised marine fuel delivery systems to establish end-to-end supply chains.

Financial risk management becomes critical as trading firms manage price volatility, credit exposure, and supply chain disruptions across global ammonia markets serving both traditional and marine fuel applications. Sophisticated hedging strategies and inventory management systems enable consistent fuel supply availability despite commodity market fluctuations.

Shipping Companies and Fuel Supply Agreements

Long-term fuel supply agreements provide revenue certainty for infrastructure investment whilst guaranteeing fuel availability for shipping companies committed to alternative fuel vessel operations. These agreements typically include minimum volume commitments, price adjustment mechanisms, and force majeure provisions addressing infrastructure development delays or operational disruptions.

Contract structures must address fuel quality specifications, delivery scheduling flexibility, and backup fuel availability during infrastructure maintenance or emergency situations. Quality assurance protocols ensure low-carbon ammonia meets certification standards required for emissions compliance reporting and environmental claims validation.

Geographic coverage agreements coordinate fuel availability across shipping routes with infrastructure development timelines, potentially requiring initial concentration on specific trade lanes before expanding to global route coverage. Strategic partnership development enables shipping companies to influence infrastructure location decisions whilst providing demand certainty for facility investment planning.

Economic Challenges and Investment Requirements

Capital Expenditure for Infrastructure Development

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure development requires substantial capital investment across production facilities, port terminals, and vessel modifications. Shore-based terminal construction costs vary significantly between new facility development and existing infrastructure retrofitting, with cryogenic handling requirements representing the largest cost component relative to conventional fuel terminals.

Production facility investments include carbon capture and storage infrastructure, renewable energy procurement systems, and specialised ammonia synthesis equipment optimised for low-carbon production pathways. The CF Industries $4 billion Blue Point facility demonstrates the scale of investment required for commercial-scale low-carbon ammonia production targeting marine fuel applications.

Port infrastructure adaptation costs depend on existing facility capabilities, with LNG-capable ports possessing some cryogenic expertise but requiring ammonia-specific modifications for toxicity management and different temperature requirements. New terminal construction provides opportunities for optimised design but requires higher capital investment compared to facility retrofitting approaches.

Fuel Cost Competitiveness and Pricing Dynamics

Current ammonia fuel cost premiums reflect small-scale production, limited infrastructure availability, and regulatory compliance requirements that differ significantly from conventional marine fuel cost structures. Production cost competitiveness improves through economies of scale, but infrastructure development costs must be recovered through fuel pricing mechanisms during initial deployment phases.

Carbon pricing integration creates complex fuel cost structures incorporating production pathway carbon intensity, regulatory credit values, and emissions compliance costs that vary across different shipping markets and regulatory jurisdictions. These factors create pricing volatility beyond traditional commodity market fluctuations affecting long-term contract negotiations.

Fuel cost parity with conventional marine fuels may require carbon pricing levels of $100-150 per tonne CO2 or direct regulatory mandates for alternative fuel adoption. Economic competitiveness improves through technology advancement, infrastructure scaling, and regulatory framework evolution, but timeline uncertainty creates investment risk for early infrastructure development.

Risk Allocation in Long-Term Supply Contracts

Long-term fuel supply agreements must allocate risks including infrastructure development delays, fuel quality variations, regulatory framework changes, and force majeure events affecting fuel availability or vessel operations. Contract structures typically share these risks across producers, trading firms, and shipping companies based on each participant's ability to manage specific risk categories.

Infrastructure development risk allocation includes construction delays, regulatory approval processes, and technology performance guarantees that affect fuel availability timing. Producers typically retain manufacturing risk whilst sharing infrastructure development risk with trading partners and customers through minimum volume commitments and milestone-based contract activation.

Regulatory risk management addresses potential changes in emissions compliance requirements, fuel certification standards, and safety regulations affecting operational procedures. Contract provisions include adjustment mechanisms for regulatory compliance cost changes whilst maintaining base pricing structures for predictable cost components.

Future Market Scaling and Global Route Development

Regional Hub Development Strategies

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering hub development follows established maritime fuel supply patterns, concentrating initially in major shipping route intersections with existing ammonia handling infrastructure before expanding to secondary ports serving regional trade routes. The strategic focus on US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe demonstrates industry recognition of infrastructure development economics and operational risk management.

Hub development strategies prioritise ports with existing ammonia import or export infrastructure serving fertiliser and industrial markets, enabling shared infrastructure utilisation and economies of scale across multiple applications. This approach reduces infrastructure investment requirements whilst leveraging established operational expertise and regulatory approval frameworks.

Geographic expansion planning coordinates infrastructure development with shipping route priorities, vessel deployment schedules, and regional regulatory framework development. Strategic hub placement enables vessels to maintain operational flexibility across multiple trade routes whilst ensuring fuel availability throughout planned operational areas.

Trade Flow Implications and Supply Chain Reconfiguration

Low-carbon ammonia marine fuel development may redirect existing ammonia trade flows from traditional fertiliser export routes toward emerging bunkering hub locations. Current ammonia trade patterns concentrate exports from US Gulf, Middle East, and Trinidad to markets in Europe, Asia, and South America, providing established logistics networks that can be adapted for marine fuel applications.

Supply chain reconfiguration requires coordination between fertiliser market service and marine fuel demand, potentially creating seasonal allocation challenges as agricultural demand peaks during planting seasons whilst shipping fuel demand remains relatively consistent throughout the year. Strategic inventory management and production scheduling become critical for managing dual-market service requirements.

Trade flow evolution depends on the relative development of production facilities, infrastructure availability, and vessel adoption rates across different geographic regions. Early concentration in established ammonia-handling regions may gradually expand toward distributed production networks serving regional shipping markets with dedicated marine fuel production facilities.

Timeline for Commercial Deployment and Market Penetration

Commercial ammonia bunkering deployment follows a staged development pathway beginning with pilot operations (2025-2027) enabling safety protocol validation and operational procedure refinement before scaling to early commercial operations (2028-2030) serving regional shipping routes with established infrastructure.

However, the scale-up phase (2030-2035) targets major shipping lane coverage as infrastructure networks expand and vessel availability increases through both new construction and retrofit programmes. This phase requires coordination between infrastructure development, fleet conversion timelines, and regulatory framework implementation across multiple jurisdictions.

Full deployment (2035-2050) projects ammonia achieving 35-50% marine fuel market share through comprehensive infrastructure networks, established operational procedures, and regulatory frameworks supporting widespread adoption. This projection depends on successful technology demonstration, cost competitiveness achievement, and policy support for maritime decarbonisation objectives.

Market penetration rates depend on infrastructure investment levels, regulatory implementation timelines, and technology advancement speeds that reduce operational costs and complexity. Early success in pilot programmes and regional deployment creates momentum for accelerated scaling, whilst infrastructure delays or technical challenges may extend development timelines beyond current projections. Furthermore, as demonstrated by initiatives like the Pilbara clean fuel bunkering hub, regional developments are gaining momentum across multiple maritime hubs worldwide.

Disclaimer: This analysis involves forecasts, projections, and speculative assessments based on current industry developments and announced plans. Actual market development may differ significantly from these projections due to regulatory changes, technological advancement rates, infrastructure investment levels, and unforeseen market dynamics. Investment decisions should incorporate comprehensive risk assessment and professional consultation regarding specific operational requirements and market conditions.

Shipping and marine environment protection on the high seas

Ships trading across the world's oceans are subject to stringent environmental, safety and security rules, which apply throughout their voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 globally-binding treaties and other measures to support shipping’s sustainable use of the oceans, enforced through a well-established system of flag, coastal and port State control.

IMO instruments that actively contribute to the conservation of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, include, among others:

At the time, US President Donald Trump threatened to personally sanction any officials who voted to adopt the provisional agreement to decarbonise the shipping industry.
“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on a net-zero emission path towards 2025,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday.
“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets, but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.

Greece is joining Saudi Arabia and the US in negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The three countries are united by their commitment to using natural gas to power ships, a position opposed by the EU, which seeks to promote the adoption of low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels.

Greece is effectively ramping up its reversal of last October, when both Athens and Nicosia abstained from a vote on a new Net-Zero Framework for global shipping, for which a unanimous EU position had been agreed.

At the time, US President Donald Trump threatened to personally sanction any officials who voted to adopt the provisional agreement to decarbonise the shipping industry. The IMO session ended in disarray, with an agreement to reconvene a year later.

Standing firm

There are now serious doubts as to whether the bloc can present a unified front in time for a November showdown in London.

“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on a net-zero emission path towards 2025,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday.

“It’s very important that all EU Member States stay united,” the official added. “We are looking into the news, and we are in contact with all member states and the relevant authorities.”

The Greek defection, reminiscent of Italy signing up to China’s Belt-and-Road initiative in 2019 without the say-so of its EU neighbours, is adding to the troubles of the net-zero shipping framework, a global initiative provisionally agreed last April.

A Greek government source told Euractiv that Athens intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to reach an agreement that serves both the US and Europe.

“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets, but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.

Still, some argue that internal divisions have left the EU impotent in the face of White House pressure.

“Rather than having their voice heard within the EU, this announcement places Greece into a minority of oil-exporting petrostates,” said Felix Klann, a shipping policy officer at the organisation Transport and Environment.

Lukas Leppert, a representative of the German environmental organisation NABU, said the Greek decision to side with the US and Saudi Arabia “displays their continued deviation.”

“It is an attack on an agreed compromise,” Leppert said.

Building on e-fuel progress to date The progress made so far to scale e-fuel production and use offers important insights for its continued development.","E-fuels are clean fuels that can be used in existing engines and infrastructure, with emissions that are more than 80% lower than those of fossil fuels.

Location, cost reduction and policy collaboration can all help to scale e-fuel production and use across many different industries.

Leaders gathering at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2026 will discuss how to scale clean fuels and drive economic growth.

At the COP30 climate change conference in November 2025, more than 20 countries committed to Belem 4x – a pledge to quadruple the use of sustainable fuels by 2035 from a 2024 baseline. Sustainable fuels, also called clean fuels or low-carbon molecules, include liquid biofuels, biogases, low-emission hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels like e-fuels.

Currently, liquid fuels provide half to two-thirds of global primary energy demand. But alternatives to fossil fuels are quite limited in sectors like aviation, shipping, industry and heavy road transport. Greater use of sustainable fuels by these industries could reduce emissions and bolster global energy security by diversifying fuel supply and reducing import dependence. This would require scaling clean fuels, however.

One clean fuel option that is ripe for scaling is e-fuel. Produced by combining green hydrogen with recycled or direct air captured CO₂, e-fuels are chemically equivalent to hydrocarbons, but their emissions can be more than 80% lower than those of fossil fuels.

Known as ""drop-in"" fuels, e-fuels can be used in existing engines and transported and stored using existing infrastructure. That’s particularly important for long-lived and older infrastructure and for consumer choice.

E-fuel can store and transport renewable energy in molecular form, allowing it to reach markets that cannot rely on direct electrification. This means it could be useful in countries with abundant but remote renewable resources, such as Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Morocco, Canada, the US and Australia. In such locations, at-scale e-fuel projects would complement electrification, rather than replace it.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only 1% of clean fuels are hydrogen and hydrogen-derivative-based fuels like e-fuels. In other words, e-fuels are still nascent. Location, cost reduction and policy collaboration will all play a key role in scaling e-fuels.

E-fuel production is technically proven

Several e-fuel demonstration facilities have already shown that clean molecule production is technically viable. One example is the HIF Haru Oni e-fuel facility in southern Chile. It has been operating for three years, producing green hydrogen and synthesizing it with recycled CO₂ to make e-methanol, e-gasoline and e-liquid gas. Fuels from the site have already shown early promise in several environments.

Porsche has tested Haru Oni’s e-fuels at various global events, for example, including the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup and the Arosa ClassicCar races. The Chilean Navy has also powered a motorboat used by its Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service with e-fuel, while expedition company Antarctica21 has fuelled its Zodiac boats with e-gasoline to promote sustainable tourism.

More recently, the Port of Açu in Brazil launched a green shipping corridor with the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium, just before COP30. This could become one of the world’s first large-scale e-fuel export routes by 2030.

These early collaborations show synthetic fuels can meet demanding technical and operational requirements, which should encourage other sectors to consider low-carbon fuels as well.

How to scale e-fuel use

Cost is still the main challenge for scaling e-fuel use across multiple industries. Producing e-fuels remains more expensive than fossil fuel refining, primarily due to the cost of renewable electricity, electrolysis and CO₂ capture.

But other clean energy technologies, such as solar, have overcome similar challenges. In those cases, deployment policy, standardization and mass manufacturing efficiencies delivered steep cost reductions. Clean molecules could follow a comparable trajectory as e-fuel technologies mature, deployment increases and modularization drives efficiencies.

In fact, the industry is already working to overcome the production cost challenge. Over the last 36 months, electrolyzer plant standardization and pre-engineering innovations have been developed that promise steep cost reductions, as well as lower project construction costs due to modularization. Tapping into existing industrial clusters can also help capture infrastructure efficiencies and large quantity equipment orders through economies of scale.

The next frontier of cost reduction is expected to come from competition and efficiency breakthroughs in CO₂ capture, and more coordinated co-development with host countries seeking development of new industries.

Policy that is simple, certain and creates investible opportunities will help e-fuels – and all clean fuels – to achieve scale. Globally, interoperable policy that prioritizes least-cost production is essential, including harmonized standards, lifecycle-based rules and demand-creation mechanisms. This will help reduce uncertainty for investors and producers and enable viable long-term offtake agreements.

A recent World Economic Forum report, Fuelling the Future: How Business, Finance, and Policy Can Accelerate the Clean Fuels Market, highlights how performance-based policies, public-private cooperation and demand signals from industry can work together to accelerate investment and deployment across clean fuels.

Building on e-fuel progress to date

The progress made so far to scale e-fuel production and use offers important insights for its continued development. E-fuels can be produced with existing technology, they can be used in current engines and distribution systems, and early users have shown they can perform reliably. The next step is to translate demonstration experience into investments capable of delivering meaningful production volumes.

Reducing emissions in hard-to-abate sectors is one of the most challenging parts of the global net-zero challenge. Clean molecules such as e-fuels provide a practical option to accelerate emissions reductions in areas where few alternatives exist. The technical foundations are in place, early lessons have been learned and momentum is building. Now the focus must shift to scaling e-fuel solutions.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_4kZrCIXRA0yt6T0UfwatecS-iTjUsPMUq2yWe83WpBI.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 10:58:59.401920

The proposal is under discussion at the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO). Athens is abandoning a joint EU position on global shipping decarbonisation, which is currently frozen at the IMO.

“Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate, through their competent ministries – shipping and energy – with a view to submitting a joint proposal on this specific matter,” Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said on Thursday, following a meeting in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud.

Athens is providing a “voice of realism” on energy issues in Europe, Papastavrou added.

The move is expected to raise eyebrows in Brussels. That’s because individual EU countries are expected to seek agreement with the remaining 26 rather than cooperate with third countries on a matter over which the European Commission holds exclusive competence.

It is already the second time Athens, home to much of the global shipping industry, has broken the bloc’s ranks after Greece, alongside Cyprus, abstained during an October vote in London on a global net-zero shipping deal.

At the centre of the debate is the Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NSF), which would force ship operators continuing to use the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportionate to their excess CO2 emissions.

In practice, the framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy, favouring countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

However, agreement on the proposal was postponed for a year last October following opposition from Washington and Riyadh. The US administration even threatened sanctions if the deal went ahead, as Washington supports liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel.

The diplomatic row last October was widely seen as another instance of Europe being caught in a broader geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing. Denmark, which opposed the US line, appears to have paid a price, having failed for the first time in late November to secure re-election to the IMO Council.

Breaking the bloc

Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal. Now it appears to have renegotiated the deal with Washington and Riyadh, not Brussels.

But Greece’s position could trigger an infringement procedure within the EU.

One EU diplomat noted that only the EU as a whole can table a common position at the IMO, and that in the event of internal disagreement, the bloc simply has no official position.

“Member states do not align themselves with third-country camps,” the diplomat added.
