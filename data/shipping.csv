His Excellency Dr. Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, Minister of Transport and Communications, has emphasised that Bahrain views international conventions and treaties as fundamental for building a safe and sustainable maritime sector.

H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla participated in the 34th session of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held in the United Kingdom.

In his address to the General Assembly, H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed affirmed that since Bahrain acceded to the IMO, the Kingdom has remained an active partner, fully committed to the organisation’s goals and mission of enhancing global maritime safety and protection.

The Minister explained that the Kingdom implements its international commitments through an advanced legislative and regulatory framework, including the Maritime Law issued in 2022, which contains provisions that reinforce full compliance with maritime conventions, provide a legal framework to protect lives and property, and ensure the safety of navigation.

Commitment

He also highlighted Bahrain’s strong commitment to marine environmental protection, considering the safeguarding of the oceans and seas a humanitarian and ethical duty.

H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla emphasised that the Kingdom follows a modern legislative system primarily based on the MARPOL Convention and is working to accede to the remaining annexes to support plans for achieving net-zero emissions by 2060.

The minister emphasised that the IMO’s theme for this year, “Our Ocean, Our Commitment, Our Opportunity”, reflects the environmental and economic significance of the oceans, recognising them as a lifeline and vital resource for millions of people worldwide.",https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_He69pcwkNm_2025-11-27_1764229991resized_pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:12.919395

Shipping was meant to embrace decarbonisation under one flag with global rules for a global ocean.
Instead, we're drifting towards a patchwork quilt of carbon schemes, stitched together by short-term politics.","As everyone either sighed with relief or rolled their eyes at the IMO's decision to delay its Net Zero Framework, few seem to grasp what could be coming while we wait for a resolution.

What looks like a pause is, in reality, a power vacuum and national regulators are already rushing to fill it.

Many countries stand to benefit, using the delay to launch their own systems. The UK's Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) comes into force in June 2026.

Turkey is lining up its own version, while Gabon on Africa's west coast is openly discussing a local carbon levy. Where they lead, others will surely follow.

For governments under budget pressure, carbon pricing has less to do with environmental policy and more to do with revenue.

Countries face widening fiscal gaps and this is an easy way to plug them.

By stalling on a global standard, the industry is accelerating the creation of fragmented regional systems.

Shipping was meant to embrace decarbonisation under one flag with global rules for a global ocean. Instead, we're drifting towards a patchwork quilt of carbon schemes, stitched together by short-term politics.

Each will bring its own reporting formats, verification rules, and traps for the unwary.

Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong.

Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill.

The irony is hard to miss.

Charterers demand reliability, while shipowners could face fines and detentions for rules in a country they didn't even know existed. Smaller and mid-sized owners, without the luxury of in-house compliance teams, would be the first to feel the pain.

Worse still, there's no guarantee the revenues raised will fund genuine decarbonisation.

Some governments won't even know how much they'll collect from ETS schemes until year-end and when the numbers arrive, the temptation surely will be to divert them to other, more immediate causes?

Carbon markets were meant to drive cleaner ships, not fund pension deficits. Instead of aligning the industry, we may see governments chase easy cash whilst claiming its for the benefit of the planet.

Turkey's next move could trigger a domino effect.

Each new national system that gets implemented will make it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally agreed approach later. Like a maritime Humpty Dumpty, once the rules shatter into regional fragments, they'll be impossible to piece back together.

The cost of this fragmentation is already showing.

Asian owners are quietly steering clear of European routes, wary of overlapping compliance traps. If the IMO waits much longer, trade patterns could start redrawing themselves along regulatory fault lines.

The delay is meant to give the industry time to adapt.

Instead, it risks breeding confusion, competition, and complacency. The world isn't waiting for London to decide, it's moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.

For shipowners, the message is clear.

Compliance can't be managed port by port or spreadsheet by spreadsheet. While the industry waits for clarity, owners need a real-time approach to tracking changing rules with reliable data and strategies that anticipate rather than react.

That's where companies like EmissionLink can help. We monitor global emissions schemes continuously, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance so owners can stay compliant, and stay trading without being caught by local tariff schemes.

The choice is simple. You either build the capability to track and manage compliance globally, or risk being caught out at the next port of call.

The industry needs clarity and consistency.

Either we move together or we'll end up with a hundred different systems no one can reconcile. In the end, delay doesn't buy us much time to avoid more chaos.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_327989fd8ebd00c9bef0a7d2dd619c69.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:19.523624

In India, the new corridors include: India Green Corridors; India-Denmark Green Corridors; India-Singapore and Kandla-Tuticorin Coastal Green Corridor.
“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.
Many agnostic green corridors continue to mention interest in battery electric propulsion.","“At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025,” has identified 25 new green corridor initiatives, expanding the global total to 84 such active initiatives. For the first time, green corridor initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions, the report has said.

New green corridor initiatives have been announced in India (+4), China (+4), Brazil (+2), Chile (+2), Ghana, and Kenya etc. This aligns with governmental maritime and energy ambitions in these geographies, such as the Indian Shipping Ministry’s 2025 goals, China’s efforts to accelerate the development of port infrastructure and green fuels, Brazil’s National Hydrogen Program, Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy, and national commitments to green shipping by Kenya and Ghana. In India, the new corridors include: India Green Corridors; India-Denmark Green Corridors; India-Singapore and Kandla-Tuticorin Coastal

Green Corridor.

The report comes soon after the International Maritime Organisation (IMO’s) Marine Environment Protection Committee adjourned discussions on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework for one year. The delay was due to lobbying from the US administration, which had threatened countries with tariffs if they supported the net zero framework.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum in a statement. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

Methanol and ammonia continue to be popular fuel options in these corridors. Many agnostic green corridors continue to mention interest in battery electric propulsion. Short-sea corridors

focused on electric roll-on/roll-off passenger and ferry vessels, primarily within the

European region, remain a strong trend as well; advanced biofuels (biodiesels and biocrudes), particularly second-generation biodiesel, remain an energy source of interest for a small group of green corridors and this year also marked the first announcement of a nuclear corridor between the US and UK, the report said.

The report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a ‘feasibility wall’ created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted. That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up,” Fahnestock said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/30/1600x900/logo/ht-generic_india3_1751287297962_1751287304722.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 21:56:49.776274

With the event now concluded — and with a few days to reflect on the key discussions, outcomes, and overall atmosphere — we took the opportunity to speak with IBIA Executive Director Alexander Prokopakis to get his take on on how it went, perspectives on some of the key takeaways and talking points, and what the association has planned for its members in the months ahead.

S&B - Looking back on the event as a whole, how satisfied are you with the outcome and what feedback have you received from delegates?

AP - We are very happy with the event. It was our third time in Hong Kong after 2005 and 2013, and this was by far the best. Not just in Hong Kong, but one of our strongest conventions to date. After Houston, Dubai, and Athens, you can see the momentum building and the increase in IBIA's relevance.

Bringing the Convention into Hong Kong Maritime Week, a wider reaching industry event, this worked well and the feedback has been great: venue, energy, and a programme that genuinely delivered.

I also want to use this moment to thank my team, the IBIA Secretariat. They put in a huge amount of work behind the scenes, and the result showed.

S&B - What were your main takeaways from Hong Kong, and were there any surprises for you - positive or negative - from the stage or sidelines?

AP - Not a surprise, but definitely a big positive was the energy in Hong Kong. The city is vibrant, Hong Kong Maritime Week was packed, and the engagement from delegates was exactly what we hoped for. It's why we chose Hong Kong in the first place.

What did surprise me, in a good way, was the level of support from the local side. The Hong Kong Shipowners Association, who I see as a real partner, the local sponsors, and the Hong Kong government were fully behind us. That made a huge difference and helped us deliver the event at the level we wanted.

S&B - IMO NZF was a big talking point. Did discussions at the event shift your view on how well suppliers and shipowners understand the current regulatory direction and/or how they will now respond?

AP - IMO's Net Zero Framework was a key topic. The discussions confirmed shipping's resilience, but also highlighted the need for all stakeholders, regulators, associations, and the industry to work more closely together to collectively address the concerns raised about the IMO NZF and risks that future regulatory changes may present to the industry.

It's an opportunity to create a stronger, practical framework to meet the targets. The Convention reinforced that bunkers are more relevant to shipping than ever. Whilst there was a strong emphasis on alternative fuels, we recognise that conventional fuels aren't going anywhere soon. We need to stay focused on today's reality, ensuring safety, supporting seafarers, and delivering fuels transparently and reliably for the industry.

S&B - MFMs were another recurring theme at the event, with both official and informal announcements about new markets preparing to adopt the technology, and discussion around IBIA's role in supporting that uptake. After participating in these conversations, how would you describe IBIA's current position and responsibilities in advancing MFM adoption on both a worldwide basis and regionally via initiatives such as BSI in ARA?

AP - IBIA's position on MFMs has been clear and constant from the start: we support a more transparent industry. We welcome the announcement that Hong Kong is to make MFM mandatory for methanol bunkering, we encourage this for all products, and the news that the Republic of Korea may do the same for all marine fuel deliveries.

MFM is a tool that works best under a common global regulatory framework. Ideally this is the ISO standards or the SS648:2024 which Singapore is using and has been tested and proven.

But it's not just about the tool itself; it's how it's implemented and enforced. IBIA is vocal in supporting ports and industry initiatives, but global adoption is still limited. Can MFM help the industry? Absolutely. But we need consistent rules and practical application.

As for regional initiatives such as BSI in ARA, IBIA supports collaboration among stakeholders, especially between our members. My understanding is that the BSI initiative in ARA is launching officially soon; we're waiting for more details. I'd like to see tangible outcomes that improve transparency in the industry, and we'll be watching to see how it develops. If it can help address the current challenges and improve transparency, that would be very welcome.

Allow me to add and inform the Ship & Bunker readers that IBIA, in collaboration with C4fuel and with support from the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, has delivered comprehensive training for surveyors. We strongly believe that tools are only effective when users have the awareness, training, and knowledge to use them properly. Ideally, we'd like to see this kind of training and regulation made mandatory, similar to the approach in Singapore.

S&B - What topics or emerging priorities do you anticipate will take centre stage and shape the agenda at next year's event?

AP - It's a bit early to say, the Convention has just finished! Shipping and bunkering are constantly evolving. Next year's agenda will depend on the region we choose. The decision will be made in the coming months and announced at the IBIA Annual Dinner in London on February 9th.

Ultimately, the priorities will come from our members and what matters most to the industry at that time.

S&B - Until then, which upcoming IBIA events should readers be aware of, and what can they expect from them?

AP - Nice question, thank you for the opportunity. On December 10th, we have our Members' Meeting, reviewing 2025 and looking ahead to 2026, giving members the chance to shape our focus.

Our first major premier event of the year is the much-anticipated IBIA Annual Dinner in London. Likely another sold-out night with around 1,200 industry leaders, kicking off IE Week.

We'll also host a networking event in the US at CMA in March, following last year's success, before moving to Singapore for Maritime Week in April, where the IBIA Asia Dinner will bring together around 350 industry players.

Later in the year, we're back in Athens for Posidonia with a cocktail reception, and then the major bunkering industry event, SIBCON in Singapore.

Monitoring IMO meetings, following industry and regulatory developments, and providing training for our members is core to what we do. Through our working groups, we focus on key areas like technical aspects, bunker licensing & mass flow meters, alternative fuels, and digitalization, all essential to supporting the industry and helping members.

China, India, and Brazil look to capture major opportunities in zero-emission shipping amidst regulatory uncertainty.

Report warns against ‘wait and see’ attitude following delay to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework.

Report calls for action at the national level to drive progress, create first-mover advantage, and position for early access to future IMO incentives.

27 November 2025, Copenhagen – The movement to create green shipping corridors – trade routes designed to demonstrate and scale novel zero-emission fuels, vessels, and technologies – has expanded in numbers and geographic scope, according to a new progress report published today by the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum.

This year’s edition, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new green corridor initiatives, expanding the global total to 84 active initiatives. For the first time, initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions.

The news comes only a month after discussions to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) landmark Net-Zero Framework, designed to establish a path for shipping to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, were delayed for at least one year.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’, an important milestone at which the construction and/or operation of vessels, infrastructure, and/or fuel plants takes place. However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a 'wait and see' approach. Instead, corridors should make use of emerging policies and programmes from national governments, such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme – something that would unlock progress ahead of a global framework and put participants among the frontrunners to benefit from future IMO incentives.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

To best expand and progress green corridors, the report recommends the industry:

Pursue strategies to break inertia and maintain momentum, closing the cost gap and ensuring corridors are advanced enough to qualify for first mover rewards once they’re available.

Capitalise on the opportunity to shape IMO policy, like the reward mechanism, and be well-positioned to benefit from eventual regulation.

Better engage those with ambitious decarbonisation goals that can help scale solutions, particularly cargo owners who may be more willing to pay a premium for cleaner fuels.

Utilise emerging national policy and adapt it for new geographies to accelerate change and encourage industry buy-in.

Stay true to original principles, remembering that green corridors’ greatest contribution to maritime decarbonisation comes from fostering collaboration and prioritising harder-to-deploy e-fuels over more readily available solutions.

Momentum builds as an Acu-Antwerp corridor is identified as a high potential green e-fuel export corridor with considerable stakeholder interest.

Earlier this month in Rio de Janeiro, a critical piece of the maritime decarbonization puzzle fell into place. The Oceans of Opportunity Summit brought together senior leaders from ports, shipping companies, energy developers, financiers, and government to advance Brazil’s e-fuel export opportunity. The gathering highlighted Brazil’s emergence as a maritime e-fuel powerhouse and discussed a pre-feasibility study conducted by RMI that reveals a strong business case for a green e-fuel export corridor from the Port of Açu to the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

Brazil’s competitive advantage: World-class conditions for low-cost e-fuel production

Brazil has positioned itself as an emerging green fuel leader with unique advantages that set it apart from competing global production hubs. Its world-class renewable capacity, largely renewable grid, and abundant biogenic carbon and freshwater make it one of the most attractive locations for e-fuel production globally.

In addition to strong e-fuel production fundamentals, Brazil has advanced its regulatory landscape in recent years. The National Hydrogen Program (PNH2) signaled Brazil’s ambition to become a competitive global producer and develop low-carbon hydrogen hubs. Building on this, the Legal Framework for Low-Carbon Hydrogen created the National Certification System (SBCH2) that will certify emissions aligned with international standards. Additionally, the tax benefit regime, Rehidro, was created along with tax credits through Low-Carbon Hydrogen Development Program (PHBC).

Together, these regulatory advancements enable certifiable decarbonization, e-fuel export certification compatibility, improve project bankability, and support the development of e-fuel hubs like the Port of Açu.

The Port of Açu is already a significant industrial hub in Brazil, and it is primed to support the development of significant e-fuel projects. As one of Latin America’s largest deepwater and private port-industrial complexes, it has joined the World Economic Forum’s Low-Carbon Industrial Clusters initiative and is positioned to drive decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors.

The Port of Açu has also generated interest from e-fuel developers. Açu-based developers have announced projects of up to 800,000 metric tons per year of e-methanol and 2.5 million metric tons per year of e-ammonia. As with any global e-fuel project, they face uncertainty, and not all announced volumes may materialize. Securing offtake is critical to improving viability, and green e-fuel export corridors to Europe can provide Açu-based projects with access to one of the world’s fastest-growing green fuel markets.

IMO policy framework could shift maritime economics toward zero-emission fuels

The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, which is on the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s (MEPC) October 2026 agenda for adoption, could fundamentally shift the economics of maritime decarbonization if adopted. New greenhouse gas regulations and fuel-intensity standards create increasingly favorable conditions for zero and near-zero-emission fuels, providing the financial incentives the sector needs to transition. Under proposed IMO reward incentives, zero-emission vessels running on ammonia or methanol can narrow or even eliminate lifetime cost premiums compared to conventional fuel operations on the Brazil-Europe route.

E-fuel exports to Europe can de-risk and accelerate production scale-up at Port of Açu

The European Union’s regulatory framework — combining FuelEU Maritime mandates with Emissions Trading System (ETS) requirements — already initiates a market pull for zero-emission fuels. These policy frameworks could generate significant demand within the next decade.

European industrial and maritime sectors are already driving appetite for green fuels across Northwest Europe’s major industrial clusters and shipping routes. Demand by 2035 could amount to almost 12 million metric tons per year of green ammonia, considering demand from the fertilizer, refining, and maritime sectors, and almost 4 million metric tons per year of green methanol, considering demand from the maritime sector.1

The Port of Antwerp-Bruges, among the continent’s largest industrial and bunkering hubs, could capture about 15 percent of EU green-fuel demand. This figure reflects estimated demand in Belgium and portions of Germany, together with the Port’s stated estimates and ambition for the markets it aims to serve. The port is rapidly expanding its multi-fuel infrastructure, with methanol handling already underway and ammonia capability expanding.

Strong momentum: Senior maritime leaders convene to advance the Açu-Antwerp corridor

The Oceans of Opportunity Summit demonstrated clear momentum for Brazil’s e-fuel opportunity. The convening of senior leaders from ports, shipping lines, energy developers, financiers, and government officials confirmed the sector’s commitment to making this opportunity operational.

The workshop that followed convened a smaller group, bringing together actors interested in potentially forming a consortium for the delivery of an Açu-Antwerp green fuel export corridor. E-fuel producers, port authorities from Açu and Antwerp, and shipping lines with zero-emission-capable vessels all joined the dialogue, underlining the sense of interest

High-potential corridor: Pre-feasibility confirms strong economics and path forward

RMI’s pre-feasibility study presented at the summit confirms that the Açu-Antwerp corridor is a high-potential route for multiple reasons. First, demand signals from European ports and industrial clusters provide greater demand visibility for Açu production, as the Port of Antwerp-Bruges is one of Europe’s largest bunkering hubs and petrochemical clusters. Second, vessel economics on the Brazil-Europe route can approach cost parity with conventional fuels under proposed IMO reward scenarios. Third, the infrastructure requirements are buildable on realistic timelines to support e-fuel exports at the Port of Açu and imports at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

Despite its high potential, the corridor faces several challenges. Greater clarity is needed on the extent to which Açu-based projects will be EU RFNBO compliant. The IMO Net-Zero Framework’s adoption was delayed until 2026, adding uncertainty around how significant net-zero fuel incentives will be for the maritime sector. Lastly, while exports to Europe provide some of the best global offtake conditions, securing firm offtake agreements remains difficult. These challenges can create uncertainty and reduce project bankability. However, increased collaboration across the supply chain can help overcome them, underscoring the importance of green corridor consortiums.

The coalition is now pursuing what could become the world’s first major e-fuel export corridor. The next phase involves a comprehensive feasibility study that will refine these findings with greater precision: detailed delivered-cost modeling, feasible offtake structures that prioritize maritime demand, confirmed vessel and engine availability, including pilot fuel requirements, and a financial structure that strategically layers IMO rewards, EU incentives, and Brazilian programs. Export corridor operations are targeted to begin between 2030 and 2035.

Why these findings matter beyond one corridor

The Açu-Antwerp corridor represents a breakthrough moment for maritime decarbonization. It demonstrates that green fuels can be produced competitively in the Global South and delivered to demand centers with improving economics that narrow the gap with conventional fuels, especially as policy incentives are developed.

The timing is critical. The Rio summit came just a week before COP30 in Brazil, and the maritime sector — responsible for nearly 3 percent of global emissions — has long been considered one of the hardest-to-abate industries. Barriers are solvable: the technology is ready to scale, the infrastructure is buildable, and the economics are tractable. Now it’s time for industry action. From Açu to Antwerp, Brazil is poised to steer the world’s first major e-fuel corridor—turning the tide toward a net-zero ocean.

The Oceans of Opportunity Summit was convened by RMI, the Global Maritime Forum, Prumo Logística/Port of Açu, Port of Antwerp-Bruges International, and the International Association of Ports and Harbors.

Summary of amendments

Amendments to the Polar Code, adopted through IMO Resolution MSC.538(107) in June 2023, will enter into force on 1 January 2026. These revisions expand mandatory safety requirements for navigation and voyage planning to include specific categories of non-SOLAS ships, aiming to enhance operational safety and preparedness in polar environments. Vessels constructed before 1 January 2026 must achieve full compliance with the new regulations by 1 January 2027.

However, any vessels constructed on or after 1 January 2026 will need to comply with the new requirements as soon as they start to operate in polar waters. The following sections outline the key amendments and associated compliance actions.

Applicable vessels

The Polar Code amendments are applicable to:

fishing vessels of 24 meters in length overall and above;

pleasure yachts of 300 gross tonnage and upwards not engaged in trade;

cargo ships of 300 gross tonnage and upwards but below 500 gross tonnage.

Background

The IMO Polar Code includes mandatory measures covering safety part (part I-A) and pollution prevention (part II-A) and recommendatory provisions for both (parts I-B and II-B). The Code entered into force on 1 January 2017 for new vessels. Ships constructed before 1 January 2017 had to meet the safety requirements of the Polar Code by the first intermediate or renewal survey, whichever occurred first, after 1 January 2018. The environmental provisions of the Polar Code applied both to existing ships and new ships from 1 January 2017.

The Polar Code covers the full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue and environmental protection matters to increase the safety of ships operating in polar waters and reduce the risk and damage to the polar environment.

Furthermore, IMO made amendments to SOLAS introduced by Resolution MSC.532(107) and to the Polar Code, introduced by Resolution MSC.538(107) to apply specific new provisions of the Code to certain non-SOLAS vessels that operate in polar waters. The rules mandate safety requirements, including those for voyage planning and safety of navigation, in new regulations (9-1 and 11-1) of the Code.

Chapter 9-1, Safety of Navigation

An additional chapter was inserted after the existing Chapter 9 applicable to non-SOLAS ships as defined above. The new chapter provides goals, functional requirements, and prescriptive regulations related to safe navigation in polar waters. This includes the ability to receive up-to-date information including ice information, the navigation equipment and systems are designed for the expected environmental conditions, systems for providing reference headings and position fixing are suitable for the intended areas, and the ability to visually detect ice when operating in darkness.

Chapter 11-1, Voyage planning

An additional chapter was inserted after the existing Chapter 11 applicable to non-SOLAS ships as defined above. The new chapter provides goals, functional requirements, and prescriptive regulations related to voyage planning for operations in polar waters. The voyage planning requirements shall consider the following:

the procedures required by the safety management system on board; if no safety management system is implemented there shall be a documented procedure for operation in polar waters;

any limitations of the hydrographic information and aids to navigation available;

current information on the extent and type of ice and icebergs in the vicinity of the intended route;

statistical information on ice and temperatures from former years;

places of refuge;

current information and measures to be taken when marine mammals are encountered relating to known areas with densities of marine mammals, including seasonal migration areas;

current information on relevant ships’ routing systems, speed recommendations and vessel traffic services relating to known areas with densities of marine mammals, including seasonal migration areas;

national and international designated protected areas along the route;

operation in areas remote from search and rescue (SAR) capabilities.

Actions for compliance

To ensure safe operations in polar waters, companies, masters, and crew must be provided with adequate information that supports the safety of the vessel, personnel on board, and, where applicable, environmental protection.

Ships are required to adhere to the Polar Code’s performance standards and conduct thorough operational assessments.

Navigational equipment and systems must meet the updated functional requirements, and voyage planning must incorporate a comprehensive assessment of potential hazards along the intended route to ensure safe and effective navigation in polar waters.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1791438932-e1758795230221.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 16:56:31.648913

In response, DNV and the World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) ESG team have published a new guide to help shipowners navigate these evolving challenges, an effort supported by industry organizations in Hong Kong and worldwide.

The “Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies” provides a structured roadmap for advancing decarbonization. Drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience, the guide offers actionable steps for shipowners to align operational and investment decisions with both international and regional regulations. It also helps companies navigate uncertainties, adopt best practices, and take pragmatic actions that prepare them for future changes in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime said: “Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals. The collaboration with World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.”

Mr. Wang Yong Xin, the President of China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) said: “The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.”

The guide addresses the increasing complexity and cost of compliance, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and outlines procedures to manage costs while supporting the transition of fleets toward net-zero emissions. It also sets out cost-effective actions, such as energy-efficiency upgrades, phased fuel transitions, and targeted fleet renewal or retrofits, to control expenses and avoid stranded assets. By aligning investments with operational improvements and market expectations, shipowners can strengthen their commercial resilience and position themselves for long-term success.

Shipowners are also urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits, and operational optimization. Structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/zero-emission-shipping.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:10.205265

The regulatory body argued that the Santos Port Authority had exceeded its powers, claiming it lacked jurisdiction to regulate the matter.
National standards governing ballast water management In Brazil, NORMAM 401 establishes the standards for ballast water management and the penalties for noncompliance.
Bacilli and other forms of pathogenic organisms can also be transported from one region to another through discharged ballast water.
The bioinvasion issue is growing because global shipping moves around 10 billion tons of ballast water per year.","The Santos Port Authority has resumed enforcement of the rule requiring ships to present a certificate of compliance with international ballast water discharge inspection standards before docking. The measure follows a decision by Justice Teodoro Silva Santos of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), who granted an injunction in favor of the port authority.

The ruling upholds the injunction filed by the state-owned company against a decision by the National Waterway Transport Agency (Antaq), which had declared the rule invalid. The regulatory body argued that the Santos Port Authority had exceeded its powers, claiming it lacked jurisdiction to regulate the matter.

National standards governing ballast water management

In Brazil, NORMAM 401 establishes the standards for ballast water management and the penalties for noncompliance. Ships have two options: D1 – to discharge ballast water in oceanic waters, at least 200 nautical miles from the coast in areas with a minimum depth of 200 meters, or at 50 miles from the coast provided that the depth is also equal to or greater than 200 meters. D2 – the performance standard, usually met through the installation of onboard treatment systems. The most common methods combine filters with ultraviolet lamps or filters with an electrochlorination process.

Before the new rule by the Port Authority, vessel inspections were carried out by sampling, based on information provided by ship captains. Under the reinstated regulation, all vessels must be monitored.

The issue, however, is that only one company has been accredited by the port authority to perform this monitoring. In practice, certification costs an average of about US$ 1,500 per vessel – which users argue constitutes regulatory overreach.

The accredited company is responsible for verifying compliance based on information provided by ships, such as geographic coordinates, using artificial intelligence, GPS, and other technologies to confirm whether ballast water was discharged in authorized areas or whether the filtration systems required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Brazil’s NORMAM 401 were used.

According to the Port Authority, the rule is essential for local environmental protection, noting that one-third of vessels failed to meet legal obligations while the regulation was in force, highlighting shortcomings in existing inspection mechanisms. “The inspections prevent environmental damage caused by invasive and harmful species to marine life and the environment. For now, no fines will be issued, allowing shipowners time to comply with the regulation,” said Sidnei Aranha, Superintendent of Environment at the port authority.

Aranha explained that ships, by bringing residues such as sewage, toxic materials, or exotic species in their ballast water, can cause serious environmental and public health problems. Many of these animal and plant species are endemic, have no natural predators, and can reproduce quickly, competing with native species.

Bacilli and other forms of pathogenic organisms can also be transported from one region to another through discharged ballast water. The bioinvasion issue is growing because global shipping moves around 10 billion tons of ballast water per year. In Brazil alone, the figure reaches 80 million tons annually, as 95% of the country’s foreign trade is conducted by sea.

Details of the rule

Prices charged by the sole company authorized to provide the mandatory service at the Port of Santos:

US$ 1,700 per certificate for services requested by non-member maritime agencies;

US$ 1,390 per certificate for services requested by maritime agencies that are members of the Association of Shipping Agencies.

Required documentation for vessel certification

To obtain the certificate, vessels must submit the following documents:",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1880019457-e1764167304508.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:15.943345

Developments at Rotterdam Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks.
In April, Trammo completed a ship-to-ship transfer of 800 cu m of ammonia at OCI’s terminal in preparation for future ammonia bunkering.
In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier.
Rotterdam has established a joint venture with Eneco, Rotterdam Shore Power, to execute shoreside power projects in coordination with government-owned grid operators for terminals.","The Dutch port of Rotterdam is pushing ahead with infrastructure expansion for sustainable marine energy, but global decarbonization rules would be required for an industry-wide low-carbon bunker transition, the port’s Chief Operating Officer Berte Simons, told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy.

LNG and biofuel bunker sales at Rotterdam, the world’s second-largest marine refueling hub, have been on an upward trend in recent years, with the port authority kickstarting its pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050.

The port reported 2.45 million metric tons of marine fuel sales during July-September, of which alternatives to conventional, oil-based fuels accounted for 13.2%, the highest among major bunker ports. Deliveries of biofuels, composed mainly of biodiesel-fuel oil blends, reached 201,319 mt, and fossil LNG amounted to 121,614 mt.

“For the next few years, we will have LNG there together with new green fuels for quite some time,” Simons said in a recent interview. “We have set out to increase the volume of biofuels and to come up with bunkering facilities for new fuels, to work on imports and exports and bunkering strategies for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.”

The continued efforts to decarbonize Rotterdam’s bunker mix came despite International Maritime Organization member states voting in mid-October to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by a year, Platts reported earlier.

The proposed regulation, backed by the Netherlands and nearly all other EU states, was designed to promote the uptake of low-carbon fuels by placing a cost on maritime greenhouse gas emissions from 2028.

“The postponement of the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is a major setback,” Simons said. “The absence of a global level playing field, long term perspective and limited demand for sustainable transportation make it difficult to scale and remain competitive.”

Brussels has extended its Emissions Trading System to cover shipping from 2024, while introducing FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy’s greenhouse gas intensity in January, pushing up total refueling expenses for ships in EU-related trades.

October’s average delivered bunker costs for B30 with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in Rotterdam were $841.70/mt for ships sailing to a non-EU port, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator. Costs for B24 were $728.46/mt in Singapore, the world’s largest bunker port, for ships on voyages to an EU port.

Developments at Rotterdam

Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks.

At the Gate terminal, a new LNG storage tank of 180,000 cu m and additional regasification capacity of 4 bank cubic meters per year is due to be operational by the second half of 2026.

Bunker supplier Peninsula will add eight tanks with a total capacity of 80,000 cu m to its biofuel storage and blending facilities in Chane Terminal next January, bringing its total capacity to 110,000 cu m.

Rotterdam currently handles 2 million mt/year of methanol and 400,000 mt/year of ammonia, predominantly made from fossil fuels, but those would lay the foundation for the transition to sustainable methanol and ammonia bunkering, according to Simons.

The port has been piloting methanol bunkering projects. In April, Trammo completed a ship-to-ship transfer of 800 cu m of ammonia at OCI’s terminal in preparation for future ammonia bunkering. In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier.

“We are also preparing for bunkering of liquid hydrogen for short-sea shipping,” Simons said. “We are focused on having the infrastructure for new bunker fuels.”

However, the executive stressed that the marine energy transition would depend on the supply-demand fundamentals for green fuels, whose prices are higher than conventional fuels due to limited production.

“Real growth in the uptake of sustainable fuels depends on clear, consistent, and global regulation,” Simons said. “The Net-Zero Framework provides a crucial step forward — so we hope next year the NZF will be adopted.”

Shoreside power

Simons said Rotterdam has 10 berths for ocean-going ships installed with shoreside power charging network and 100 cabinets for inland shipping, with plans for further expansion.

Based on EU regulations, container and passenger ships must be connected to charging facilities by 2030 at the main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network, including Rotterdam. The ports, in turn, are required to develop the infrastructure to meet 90% of ship operators’ demand.

While inland ships can be fully electrified due to limited space for on-board battery systems, large, ocean-going ships could be designed or retrofitted to run on power at berth and turn off their auxiliary engines during “cold-ironing,” leading to lower marine fuel use and CO2 emissions as well as less air pollution.

“At the moment we have only a few OPS installations operational for cruise, ferries, offshore and smaller vessels. We are, however, fully on track to realize installations at the container terminals that will bring us to compliance,” Simons said, adding that the port’s estimated planned capacity in 2030 will be well over 150 MW.

Rotterdam has established a joint venture with Eneco, Rotterdam Shore Power, to execute shoreside power projects in coordination with government-owned grid operators for terminals. Terminal operators can also develop their own charging systems.",,N,,2025-11-26 10:56:56.817788

The recent one-year delay to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) second Extraordinary Session underlines an important truth for the maritime sector: the regulatory landscape is in a state of flux and can be difficult to predict. Additionally, the pause will likely result in a patchwork of competing regional greenhouse gas emissions regulations, further complicating compliance.

This poses challenges to the industry in a number of ways, but perhaps one of the less appreciated relates to harnessing the power of fleet analytics solutions to boost efficiency and profitability, while simultaneously supporting compliance with shifting regulations.

It’s against this backdrop that less advanced reporting solutions will fall short of what is required – basic database software or more simplistic noon reporting is unlikely to deliver for the industry at a time of evolving complexity. Instead, there is an increased need for more sophisticated solutions offering simpler, more efficient and more accurate real-time reporting, while minimising the risk of human error.

Whether because of the introduction of new regulations or a steady uptake of alternative fuels, the future is set to look different, and the industry requires fleet analytics solutions that keep pace with these changes.

Future-proofed solutions

The good news for the industry is that advanced fleet analytics solutions increasingly are designed to ensure compliance with the latest existing regulatory requirements.

This means that shipowners aren’t forced to manage splitting voyages according to the requirements of MRV, for example, because they have solutions designed to automatically organise data into the exact required structure. This is equally the case when it comes to ensuring compliance with the likes of other mandatory regulatory requirements such as the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), FuelEU, and European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

As regulatory efforts to control emissions intensify, these reporting solutions can prove particularly valuable – enabling shipowners to automatically import sensor data on fuel consumption without manual calculations.

This automation also drastically reduces the time spent by crew and shore-based personnel on repetitive data entry, reconciliation, and compilation. Hours of manual work can be reduced to minutes of review.

Additionally, these solutions allow shipowners to cross-reference reported fuel consumption with engine power, speed over ground, and bunker delivery notes (BDNs), providing further reassurance of accuracy.

Laying the groundwork for machine learning

Alongside ensuring maritime businesses are prepared for new regulatory requirements, more sophisticated fleet analytics solutions also lay the groundwork for realising the potential of advancing machine learning technologies.

This is because they enable businesses to combine automatically collated data within the same system as they store manual records, providing opportunities for superior performance analysis and the training of machine learning models by harnessing insights from both data sources. As new technologies emerge, these smarter reporting tools lay the groundwork for seizing the potential of the future, while enhancing decision making, slashing costs and reducing risk in the present.

Fitness for the future

Realising the full reporting potential of these solutions can prove transformative, ensuring accurate and compliant data is recorded automatically. We’ve heard of instances where shipowners have dealt with hundreds of reporting problems and reduced these to zero simply through investing in the latest solutions.

These will only prove more valuable at a time when the landscape is evolving and there might be challenges on the horizon – whether new regulations or the increased use of alternative fuels.

… said Dominguez.

Furthermore, the Sec-Gen acknowledged the “complex international environment” confronting global shipping, citing geopolitical tensions, shifting trade dynamics, and rapid technological and environmental transitions.

My strategic priorities, then, and now, are, to advance our sector, progressing on matters such as safety, security, decarbonization and automation; to increase our visibility as an Organization and as a sector; to be more diverse and transparent, and to enhance our support to all our Member States, particularly in the areas of technical cooperation and capacity development.

… the Secretary-General highlighted.

He also highlighted recent impacts on seafarers and vessels in the Red Sea and the Black Sea, calling them “unjust” examples of maritime workers being caught in geopolitical crosscurrents.

Despite these challenges, he underscored the vital role shipping continues to play in sustaining global trade and development.

Progress on safety, climate and technology

Reviewing the Organization’s work over the past biennium, the Secretary-General highlighted progress across key committees:

Maritime Safety Committee: Advancements in navigation safety, training standards, and regulatory frameworks for new fuels and technologies.

Marine Environment Protection Committee: Continued implementation of the IMO Greenhouse Gas Strategy, along with work on marine litter, biofouling, underwater noise, and ballast water management.

Legal Committee: Efforts to address fraudulent ship registration and protect seafarers from abandonment and criminalization.

Facilitation Committee: Major steps toward digitalization, including the now-mandatory maritime single window system.

Technical Cooperation Committee: Expanded capacity-building initiatives to support developing Member States in meeting IMO obligations.

Dominguez emphasized that these achievements are collective, praising Member States for what he described as “steady commitment” across all areas of IMO’s mandate.

Assembly to take up strategic plan, budget and key resolutions

The Assembly will consider the IMO’s revised Strategic Plan for 2024–2029, which outlines the Organization’s mission and long-term priorities. Delegates are also expected to approve the 2026–2027 budget and work programme.

Several major resolutions are slated for adoption, including:

The first comprehensive IMO Capacity Development Strategy, establishing a unified framework for technical assistance and cooperation.

The Framework and Procedures for the second cycle of the IMO Member State Audit Scheme, aimed at strengthening global implementation and transparency.

A proposal to enhance multilingualism, including introducing Arabic as a working language of the Assembly.

Internal reforms and a “fresh energy” at IMO

Dominguez also pointed to internal reforms undertaken during his tenure, including updates to staff rules, new diversity and gender strategies, improved communications, and upgrades to IMO headquarters facilities. Even the IMO logo, he noted with a smile, has undergone a facelift.

I have had to shake and restructure IMO a little, and I have had to shake you, the delegates, up a little too

… he said, adding that constructive pushback from Member States keeps him “on his toes.”

A final tribute to seafarers

Reaffirming a recurring theme of his tenure, Dominguez closed by paying tribute to the world’s seafarers, calling them the “heart of the maritime sector” and praising their resilience and professionalism amid global challenges.

With confidence in the delegates’ leadership, he urged the Assembly to deliver “meaningful outcomes” that will strengthen the Organization and support a safer, more sustainable and more inclusive future for global shipping.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54943866976_52e4b41773_o-scaled-e1764154449953.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:57:15.947673

GHG reduction progress

Achieved 11.8% reduction in Scope 1 + 2 emissions from FY2021

Decreasing factors: Energy-saving devices, slow steaming, expanded use of biofuels, replacement with newbuilds, including alternative-fuel vessels

Increasing factors: Increased voyage distances due to inability to transit the Suez Canal (geopolitical issues)

Expanded Scope 3 emissions reporting

― Expanded reporting to include all major consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates

― Collected emissions data across all Scope 3 categories

― Completed disclosure one year earlier than the original plan

Towards achieving the Scope 1 + 2 2030 and 2050 targets

2030 Target: 45% reduction by energy efficiency and low-carbon fuels

The medium-term management plan initially set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the NYK Group by 30% compared to FY2021 by FY2030. This target was updated in the NDS, adding an additional 15% reduction.

2050 Target: Net zero by fuel conversion and CDRs

The transition to alternative fuels will be accelerated, together with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) initiatives, to achieve net-zero emissions.

Expansion of biofuels

NYK reports a steady increase on the use of biofuels. This effort in FY2024 is equivalent to a reduction of 180,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. The company has launched long-term trials aimed at full-scale implementation of biofuel usage.

As a result, NYK’s vessels used 251,017 tons of B24, a blended marine fuel containing 24% second-generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from nonfood sources and certified under ISCC.

This marks a significant increase over the 6,287 tons used in fiscal year 2023. Moreover, the company implemented initiatives to address challenges related to the long-term safe use of biofuels.

Initiation of continuous use of bio-LNG fuel

Since June 2025, NYK has commenced the continuous use of bio-LNG fuel on its LNG-powered car carriers. The bio-LNG fuel is supplied by Titan Supply B.V. at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium. Starting with the supply to two vessels—Daisy Leader in June and Sumire Leader in July—the company will integrate LNG biofuel into its routine operations.

This supply is based on the mass-balance method, enabling significant GHG reductions on a well-to-wake basis. Its sustainability is verified through ISCC-EU certification, and full traceability is ensured.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2565837287-scaled-e1747304616969.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:57:21.841003

""The frame agreement, signed during Kormarine 2025, will support ship operators in reducing their cost exposure to maritime carbon pricing, keeping existing vessels competitive for longer,"" WinGD said of the deal.

Panasia is an established marine technology developer in South Korea and has system integrator contracts with multiple Korean and Chinese shipyards.

WinGD head of retrofit & upgrade solutions René Baart said, “Korea has been the biggest market for X-DF engines since they were introduced in 2016. It was therefore natural that we start here as we aim to upgrade our installed base to the latest efficient technologies. We are delighted to have found a partner, in Panasia, with so much expertise in the equipment and system integration of both Chinese and Korean-built vessels.”

While iCER uses exhaust recycling to improve combustion stability when using LNG, VCR technology increases fuel efficiency by automatically optimising compression ratio depending on the fuel used and engine load. When combined, iCER and VCR technologies can reduce methane slip to around 0.7% of fuel gas volume, a more than two-fold reduction compared with first-generation X‑DF engines.

These indicators are based on objective data, such as throughput volumes, berth productivity, emissions per Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU), and alternative fuel availability, and are complemented by expert assessments from leading shipping stakeholders.

Global importance of maritime transport

Maritime transport remains the backbone of international trade, with container ports alone handling over 80% of global non-bulk merchandise trade, underscoring their central role in sustaining large-scale economic activity. These global container ports are undergoing a period of remarkable transformation, propelled by surging trade volumes, rapid technological advancement, and intensifying climate imperatives.

In 2024, worldwide container ports throughput soared to an unprecedented 931.8mTEU, marking a 7.8% rebound after several years of subdued growth. Asian ports continue to set the pace, with Chinese terminals alone accounting for more than 40% of global container traffic.

Shanghai established a new world record, processing 51.5 million TEUs, driven by its strategic location in China’s manufacturing heartland and strong integration with China’s export economy. In comparison, Singapore achieved 41.1 million TEUs, supported by its status as a key transhipment hub.

In the United States, ports remain key economic engines, supporting 30.8 million jobs and contributing $5.4 trillion to the country’s GDP, accounting for 26% of national output. Meanwhile, emerging economies such as India, Türkiye, and Vietnam have posted double-digit growth in container volumes, driven by supply chain diversification and nearshoring strategies.

Geopolitical disruptions to global supply chains

Significant geopolitical disruptions have tested the resilience of global supply chains. The Red Sea crisis, for example, led to a 56% decline in vessel transits, with most large container ships rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope, which extended Asia–Europe and Asia-US East Coast transit times by up to two weeks.

This disruption primarily affected mainline container vessels, while regional feeder vessels were largely unaffected as they generally operate outside the high-risk corridor. The Cape route increased both shipping costs and operational complexity, highlighting the vulnerability of critical maritime corridors.

As global trade patterns shift and the industry faces new pressures, ports that are able to adapt, communicate clear strategies, and invest in future-proofing their operations will continue to lead and set the pace for the sector’s evolution.

… said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV.

Role of port authorities in shaping development

Port authorities are instrumental in shaping the growth and development of container ports. By defining long-term visions, leading critical infrastructure development, and implementing forward-thinking regulations, they establish the framework necessary for sustainable growth and innovation.

Such governance creates an enabling ecosystem where terminal operators and ancillary service providers can concentrate on optimising productivity, streamlining operations, and elevating customer experience.

The collaboration between visionary port authorities and agile operators is indispensable, driving continuous advancement and ensuring ports remain adaptable and competitive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.

Alignment with Leading Maritime Cities rankings

It is noteworthy that Singapore, Shanghai, and Rotterdam also consistently rank among the top three in the Leading Maritime Cities rankings, reflecting their continued dominance and influence at both port and city levels.

This alignment further reinforces the comprehensive leadership of these hubs across infrastructure, connectivity, and innovation.

Regional leaders across global maritime markets

The report’s regional benchmarking highlights standout ports shaping maritime trade in their respective regions. Durban is noted for resilience and strategic investment in Africa, while Lome is emerging as a key West African transhipment hub.

Savannah leads the Central and Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) region in infrastructure and connectivity, and Colon-Cristobal excels in transhipment in Panama. Mundra leads the Indian subcontinent in terms of automation and productivity, with Colombo serving as the region’s primary transhipment gateway.

Tanger Med is redefining Mediterranean logistics with rapid growth fuelled by its strategic geographic location at the crossroads of the Strait of Gibraltar, serving as a critical entry point to Europe.

In the Middle East, Dubai’s Jebel Ali leads the ranking, while Khalifa Port in Abu Dhabi is recognised for its environmental leadership. Oceania’s leader, Sydney, is recognised for its connectivity and sustainability, while Melbourne is recognised for its overall impact and efficiency.

Importance of balanced performance across all pillars

While the report celebrates the achievements of the overall leaders, it also reveals that excellence in a single indicator, or even within a single pillar, is insufficient for top-tier status.

Several ports emerged as indicator-level champions yet did not secure a place among the top five overall, or in some cases, even within their respective pillars. This underscores the importance of a holistic approach.

True global leadership in the container port sector requires balanced strength across infrastructure, connectivity, operational efficiency, sustainability, and economic impact. Ports may excel in one area, but true competitiveness and resilience come from integrating strengths across all pillars.

The top-performing container ports are both expanding capacity and rethinking how technology shapes daily operations. We see ports where automation and digital tools are woven into every process, from vessel scheduling to cargo handling. Investments in cleaner energy and integrated transport links are also making a difference, helping ports operate more efficiently and adapt to new demands

A report from VesselBot details containership fleet performance during a period of regulatory uncertainty and trade disruptions. The quarterly analysis, titled ""Decoding Maritime Emissions, Q3 2025: Containership Emissions and Traffic on the Rise,"" examined 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025.

Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km.

Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under 5 years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days.

The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.","Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.

“Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.”

Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship’s insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.

“I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,” says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.

This is the front line of Europe’s uneasy standoff with Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet”; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.

After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.

Some “shadow” ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or “spoofing” their location data.

Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.

As the BBC has learned, a growing network of “shadow” ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.

That is a troubling trend, given many are practically “floating rust buckets”, says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann. If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, “good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost”.

Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.

The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.

The head of Estonia’s navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.

The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.

What’s more, he suggests, it’s brazen: “There’s no secret made about it.”

We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato’s Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.

Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.

The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.

Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.

Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.

Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea – which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.

By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship’s then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.

The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.

In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as “false”. Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.

The BBC has tried to contact Unity’s listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC, but our emails and our calls went unanswered.

The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.

Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.

Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point “where they just don’t even bother at all”, says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.

Unity’s most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia – the point at which we spotted it.

By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.

The tanker was added to the UK and EU’s ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.

Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly detained at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.

Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.

Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) – although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.

Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that “shadow” tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.

While politicians talk of toughening action, navy and coastguard officers point out that a country’s power to act fades the further you go out to sea.

The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.

Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.

“There’s a complexity associated with it,” argues Commodore Ivo Värk. “With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.”

Frans Sanderse

The Estonians speak from experience.

When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has “constantly” had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.

The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.

“Every day in the Baltic, there’s suspicious activity,” a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, “we don’t want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself”.

“Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.”

Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.

“Thank you for your co-operation,” says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.

The exchange lasted just over five minutes.

“You need to see it in a larger perspective,” says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: “This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.”

But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward’s Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: “You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.”

There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile “the dark fleet is getting darker”.

The BBC approached Russia’s embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West’s “anti-Russian sanctions” were “illegitimate” and “undermine established principles of global commerce”.

“Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as ‘shadow fleet’ is discriminatory and misleading,” the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to “easily resolved” issues such as administrative delays.

It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had “heightened” the risks by “forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape”.

They are equipped with LNG dual-fuel engines and a significantly enlarged fuel tank—expanded by approximately 50%—to enhance operational efficiency.","The global shipping industry is grappling with the dual challenge of increasing transport volumes and an urgent need to decarbonise, transforming its perception of environmental mandates from a threat to a significant opportunity, believes Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director, DNV.

During his keynote presentation New Fuels in the Shipping Industry at the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 in Hong Kong on Tuesday (18 November) Stefanatos forecasted a consistent rise in all transport segments, creating a substantial hurdle for an industry such as shipping to reduce its carbon footprint.

While specific figures vary, the overarching trend points to growth, compelling stakeholders to seek innovative solutions. Initially viewed with apprehension, decarbonisation is increasingly seen as a chance for shipowners to differentiate, attract new cargo, and foster closer collaborations with customers.

The following were Stefanatos’ observations:

Fleet Readiness and Future Capacity

Currently, 8.9% of the global fleet is capable of burning alternative marine fuels, with liquified natural gas (LNG) holding the largest share due to its mature infrastructure and technology.

This figure, while seemingly small, represents significant progress in recent years. Looking ahead, the order book paints a more optimistic picture: over half of new vessels on order are designed with alternative fuel capabilities, signalling a substantial future shift.

However, this adoption is not uniform; segments like containerships, cruise liners, and car carriers show high uptake (75-80%), driven by end-users willing to pay a premium for greener products, while bulkers and tankers lag due to different commercial dynamics.

The Looming Fuel Supply Gap

By 2030, based on existing orders and continued ordering rates, the global fleet could theoretically have the capacity to burn nearly 50 million metric tonnes of alternative marine fuels annually. This represents a significant portion compared to the industry’s total annual consumption of 280 million tons.

Yet, a critical challenge emerges on the supply side: under current net-zero frameworks, shipping would require 30% to 60% of the global green fuel production to avoid penalties. This is a stark contrast to shipping’s current 3-4% share of the global energy mix, raising concerns about competition with other sectors and the industry’s ability to secure sufficient green fuel at competitive prices.

Navigating the Alternative Marine Fuels Landscape

There is no single “golden solution” for decarbonisation; each bunker fuel option presents a unique set of technological, economic, safety, availability, and greenhouse gas credentials. The industry is primarily focusing on four key solutions:

LNG: The most mature alternative fuel, with over 1,300 non-LNG carrier vessels already capable of using it and a wide bunkering infrastructure. Its fossil nature and methane slip concerns remain key challenges, though it offers a pathway to renewable natural gas.

Methanol: Valued for its simplicity as a liquid fuel, making port infrastructure development easier and cheaper than for gas fuels. While fossil methanol has worse emissions than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), green methanol can meet 2050 targets. Regional dynamics, such as China’s focus on green methanol production, are significantly influencing its uptake, particularly among bulk carriers trading in the region.

Ammonia: A carbon-free molecule, offering the potential for actual zero emissions at the point of combustion. However, its well-to-wake emissions depend heavily on the production pathway, and engine technology is still in development, with major makers expected to deliver engines this or next year.

Biofuels: Offers a “quick fix” with minimal retrofits for compliance. However, their scalability is severely limited by the availability of sustainable biomass, with shipping currently consuming only 0.6% of global biofuels, facing intense competition from road and aviation sectors. The need for flexible chains of custody and robust global certification schemes is crucial to accelerate adoption.

Uncertainty and the Call for Flexibility

“The path forward is marked by persistent uncertainty in regulations, supply chains, and technological advancements. Easy decision-making is not anticipated anytime soon,” concluded Stefanatos.

“Therefore, flexibility is paramount for shipowners, bunker suppliers, and fuel producers alike, recognising the complex interplay between production, distribution, and consumption in this evolving landscape.”

Singapore-based bunker supplier Global Energy Trading Pte Ltd (GET) on Wednesday (26 November) said its journey into methanol bunkering took the first step in 2023 with a ship building contract signed in Japan.

It kicked off in 2024 with the delivery of the company’s first two units of IMO type II chemical tankers, MAPLE and KARA.

GET is one of the three companies that will receive a licence by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to supply methanol as a marine fuel in the Port of Singapore. The methanol bunkering licence is valid for five years, commencing from 1 January 2026.

The other two companies are Golden Island Pte Ltd, and PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

The company said the three were picked from a pool of 13 applicants.

“Since taking delivery of the tankers, we have conducted various trial supplies of methanol in Singapore and at Malaysian ports,” GET said in a statement.

“Together with other industry players, we have gathered valuable first-hand experience from handling and supply operations to vessels at the anchorage and to container ships simultaneously during the cargo operations.”

GET has handled bio-methanol, blended bio-methanol and conventional methanol, with the largest parcel at 3,000 metric tonnes (mt).

The Group said it will be taking deliveries of another two units of 8000 DWT tankers in 2026. In the updated design, the ship will have stainless steel tanks for the optimum carriage and storage of methanol.

“While a higher cubic capacity space would ensure the ship to achieve a bigger throughput. This new design also incorporates special features to improve fuel efficiencies.”

“This opportunity accorded by MPA reaffirms Global Energy’s status as a responsible service provider together with other licensee to advance the maritime industry in its decarbonisation efforts under the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy, EU RED requirements and the FuelEU Maritime Regulations, etc.”

Japanese shipping major NYK on Tuesday (25 November) said its vessel has used 251,017 metric of B24, a blended marine fuel containing 24% second-generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from nonfood sources and certified under ISCC.

This comes following the company launching long-term trials aimed at full-scale implementation of biofuel usage in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This marked a significant increase, about 40 times more, over the 6,287 mt used in FY 2023.

The company said this in its latest report, Progress Report 2025 — NYK Group Decarbonization Story (Progress Report 2025), detailing the advances made in the NYK Decarbonization Story (NDS).

In November 2023, the NYK Group announced the NDS, setting ambitious targets: a 45% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (compared to FY2021), and net-zero emissions for Scope 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. The company is moving forward with initiatives designed to achieve these goals including the use of alternative fuels such as biofuels.

NYK added it has implemented initiatives in FY2024 to address challenges related to the long-term safe use of biofuels.

The initiatives include development of BioxiGuard, an antioxidant, additive for biofuels and development of Yunic800Eco, a fuel additive designed to improve the stability of blended fuels and enhance fuel efficiency.

Since June 2025, NYK has commenced the continuous use of bio-LNG fuel on its LNG-powered car carriers.

The bio-LNG fuel is supplied by Titan’s bunkering vessel at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium.

“Starting with the supply to two vessels—Daisy Leader in June and Sumire Leader in July—we will integrate LNG biofuel into our routine operations,” the company added.

South Korean conglomerate HD Hyundai on Sunday (23 November) said it has secured an order for ultra-large container ships worth around USD 1.46 billion, recording the largest container ship order volume in 18 years since the shipbuilding supercycle in 2007.

HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE), the intermediate holding company for HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding business, announced that it has signed a shipbuilding contract with Korea-based integrated logistics company HMM for eight 13,400-TEU dual-fuel container ships. The total contract value amounts to USD 1.456 billion.

The vessels ordered are 337 meters in length, 51 meters in width, and 27.9 meters in height. They are equipped with LNG dual-fuel engines and a significantly enlarged fuel tank—expanded by approximately 50%—to enhance operational efficiency. Of the eight vessels, two will be built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and six by HD Hyundai Samho, with deliveries scheduled consecutively through the first half of 2029.

Through this contract, HD Hyundai said it has achieved its largest container-ship order volume since 2007, when global cargo demand peaked during the economic boom (793,473 TEU). HD KSOE has secured orders for a total of 720,000 TEU (69 vessels) in container ships this year, marking the highest order volume among domestic shipbuilders.

An HD Hyundai representative, said : “We are further solidifying our position in the global market based on advanced technological capabilities and customer trust.

“Going forward, we will continue to lead the decarbonisation of the shipbuilding and shipping industries through technological competitiveness focused on eco-friendly and high-efficiency vessels.”

The IMO’s proposed Net Zero Framework was agreed in principle.

It outlines a global approach to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by or around 2050.The Framework introduces mechanisms that include a global fuel standard to progressively limit the carbon intensity of marine fuels and global emissions pricing, where ships pay levies based on carbon intensity.

“Ships using high carbon fuels should pay US$380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions, while lower carbon exceedances are checked at US$100 per tonne. Ships operating on zero and near-zero NZF fuels would be eligible for rewards through the IMO Net Zero Fund.”

Ro Filipe stated that Fiji, along with the Pacific and the wider Six-Pack Coalition, strongly supported the adoption of the NZF.

However, despite this strong advocacy, the NZF was not adopted.

Major maritime nations were in discussions about adopting rules to transition the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to reduce emissions. However, U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and other nations, opposed any worldwide tax on shipping emissions.

The U.S. had warned of potential repercussions if countries supported the levy. President Trump encouraged nations to vote “No” at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London, expressing on his social media platform Truth Social that “the United States will not tolerate this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The IMO, a United Nations agency that oversees international shipping, saw Saudi Arabia calling for a one-year adjournment of the meeting, which was agreed upon by more than half of the member countries.

In response to the decision, Ralph Regenvanu, the climate change minister of Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation, criticized the move as unacceptable given the urgent need to address escalating climate change. If the proposed green shipping regulations had been adopted, it would have marked the first instance of a global fee being imposed on greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which predominantly use heavy fuel oil releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants when burned.

The delay in implementing the regulations has left the shipping industry in a state of uncertainty. Nonetheless, there is a clear indication of the industry’s willingness to enhance environmental standards, despite facing opposition from the U.S., as noted by Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, an environmental NGO based in Brussels.

Over the past decade, shipping emissions have surged to approximately three percent of the global total due to increased trade activities and the extensive use of fossil fuels by vessels for long-distance cargo transportation. In April, IMO member states had agreed on a regulatory framework aimed at adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at the London meeting held this week.

The adoption of these regulations was intended to showcase the effectiveness of multilateral collaboration in achieving tangible progress towards global climate objectives. Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at Opportunity Green, a UK-based climate change nonprofit, emphasized that delaying the process jeopardizes the framework’s aspirations.

The proposed regulations would have established a marine fuel standard to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping fuels. Additionally, a pricing mechanism would have been implemented to levy charges for each ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships exceeding permissible limits, effectively introducing the first global tax on such emissions.

The IMO, which governs international shipping, set a target for the sector to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050 and is committed to promoting the wider use of fuels with zero or near-zero emissions.

Anaïs Rios, a shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk, urged countries to unite and return to the IMO with a resounding and unwavering “yes” vote that cannot be silenced, stressing the urgency of taking action for the planet and the future of the shipping industry.",https://dailylondontimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/default-267.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:05.813863

The amendments that were under consideration would be to MARPOL Annex VI, governing air pollution, and include the proposed IMO Net-Zero Framework, or NZF.

The session concluded with a decision to adjourn and reconvene in 12 months, allowing additional time to consider revisions to the NZF and for member states to build consensus.

In the interim, technical and implementation details are being developed and refined through IMO bodies, notably the Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, which met from Oct. 20 to 24, to advance NZF guidelines.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to reaffirm its strong opposition to the NZF, while outlining potential retaliatory measures. But European Union decarbonization regulations remain in force, and regional frameworks continue to evolve in the absence of unified IMO action.

This regulatory uncertainty highlights the importance of proactive engagement with policymakers and strategic planning across various potential compliance scenarios.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework: Scope and Ambition

The NZF is the centerpiece of the IMO's medium-term GHG reduction measures, intended to be formalized as a new Chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex VI. Its primary objective is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by 2050, in line with the 2023 IMO Strategy on GHG Emissions.

The NZF applies to all vessels of 5,000 gross tons and above on international voyages, with limited exceptions for vessels operating solely within national waters, nonmechanically propelled vessels and certain offshore platforms. The draft regulations are built on two main pillars:

Technical element: A standard that mandates progressive reductions in the GHG fuel intensity of marine fuels, measured from production to use or on a well-to-wake basis.

Economic element: A global GHG emissions pricing mechanism, requiring vessels that do not meet the GHG fuel intensity targets to purchase remedial units, with revenues paid into the IMO Net-Zero Fund by the shipowner.

This dual approach is designed, in theory, to both drive the uptake of zero and near-zero GHG fuels and technologies, and create a level playing field for the global fleet.

Key Regulatory Mechanisms and Compliance Pathways

As currently drafted, each vessel would need to calculate its annual GHG fuel intensity, based on all the fuels it used, on a well-to-wake basis.

The target GHG fuel intensity is structured into two tiers that vessels would need to meet: a base target (Tier 2) and a more stringent direct compliance target (Tier 1). Both targets get progressively more stringent annually.

At the close of each reporting year, vessels would need to assess their GHG fuel intensity compliance. Vessels that meet or exceed the direct compliance target would earn surplus units, which may be banked for up to two years, traded with other vessels or voluntarily canceled as a climate mitigation measure.

Conversely, vessels that fall short would need to offset their deficit by acquiring surplus units from other vessels — an approach known as pooled compliance — using previously banked surplus units, or purchasing remedial units from the IMO at benchmark prices.

For the 2028–2030 period, remedial unit prices were to be set at $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for Tier 1 and $380 per ton for Tier 2.

Recent IMO Actions and the Adjournment Decision

In April, the 83rd session of the MEPC endorsed the NZF text and set in motion a process for formal adoption at the October extraordinary session. Broad support was evident at the MEPC session, where the NZF advanced by simple majority.

But geopolitical dynamics evolved in the intervening months, including escalating U.S. opposition and explicit threats of reciprocal measures targeted at NZF‑supporting countries.

Notably, on Aug. 12, the U.S. secretaries of state, energy and transportation issued a joint statement, with the stated goal of ""protecting American consumers and shipping industries by defeating the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework, aka global carbon tax.""

The Trump administration made it clear that it unequivocally rejected the NZF proposal; stated it would not tolerate any action that increases costs for U.S. citizens, shipping and energy companies, and their customers; and threatened retaliation against those in support.

More notably, on Oct. 10, days before the MEPC extraordinary session, the secretaries of state, energy and transportation issued another joint statement, asserting that the administration ""unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,"" and encouraging other nations ""to join in rejecting adoption of the NZF.""

The U.S. again threatened retaliation for any IMO member states that support the proposal, which included blocking their vessels from U.S. ports, visa restrictions, additional port fees and sanctions.

The decision to adjourn stemmed from a consensus that the NZF, as written, contained uncertainties and concerns regarding the type of fuels that would be used to reach net-zero emissions, fuel availability, the infrastructure for new fuels, and port modernization required to achieve this goal.

Additionally, the decision made clear that clarification and more detail were needed to understand how the funds collected under the NZF would be disbursed and how the credits would operate.

Against that backdrop, the MEPC agreed to adjourn the extraordinary session and reconvene in 12 months, while committing to continued work on NZF implementation guidelines and further consensus‑building among member states.

The MEPC's decision preserves the path toward a unified global maritime decarbonization framework, while acknowledging the geopolitical and technical complexities at play.

With implementation work advancing at the working group, and member states engaging in intensive negotiations, the outcome will shape the trajectory of the maritime sector's climate transition, the coherence of global regulatory architecture, and the competitive landscape for shipping and its supply chain.

In the meantime, the persistence of regional regimes and the prospect of trade-linked responses underscore the need for careful strategic planning and sustained engagement across policy, operational and investment horizons.

U.S. Position and Escalating Opposition

U.S. opposition has been sustained and unequivocal during the Trump administration, and is unlikely to change in the coming years if the economic element of the draft regulations remains in place.

The U.S. delegation withdrew from the 83rd session of the MEPC on April 9, urging other governments to reconsider support for the NZF. In the August joint statement, the U.S. reiterated its view that the NZF is effectively a global carbon tax imposed by an unaccountable U.N. body, disadvantaging American consumers and supply chains while favoring competitors.

As noted previously, on the eve of the October extraordinary session, a further U.S. joint policy statement enumerated potential punitive actions against countries that voted to adopt the NZF.

These punitive measures included targeted investigations and regulatory actions to address anticompetitive practices; restrictions on port access for certain flagged vessels; tightened visa rules and fees for maritime crews; port fees on vessels owned, operated or flagged by NZF‑supporting nations; and sanctions on officials advocating climate policies perceived to burden U.S. consumers.

This escalation coincided with amendments from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to its action under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 addressing China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.

These amendments highlight the administration's broader strategy of leveraging the maritime domain to advance international and domestic policy objectives. We note, though, that this USTR action was also delayed by one year.

Voting Dynamics and Member State Positions

The April preliminary approval saw about 63 countries in favor, 16 opposed and 24 abstentions. The opposing bloc included the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Yemen.

The approving group included the European Union, China, Japan, Brazil and India, with expectations that Canada, the U.K., South Korea, Singapore, Chile and others would align in favor ahead of final adoption.

Final adoption will require a two‑thirds majority, making alignment among major flag states determinative. The U.S.' October ultimatum may further shape coalition cohesion, as member states weigh potential costs and trade implications against the benefits of a unified global decarbonization regime.

Implications for EU and Regional Regimes

IMO adoption of the NZF would have triggered reviews and possible adjustments to European Union measures governing maritime GHGs, including the Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime regulation.

With the NZF deferred, those regimes remain in place unchanged, and the industry continues to navigate a fragmented landscape of regional and national rules related to GHG emissions and marine fuels. This divergence complicates compliance planning, investment decisions and supply chain operations across global routes.

What's Next for Industry Stakeholders

In the coming months, industry stakeholders, including shipowners, charterers, fuel suppliers, shipbuilders, ports and financial institutions, face continued uncertainty and should prepare for multiple scenarios.

These include the potential of a single framework, whether it be the NZF as currently drafted or with significant amendments, or a patchwork of regional efforts if the NZF is ultimately not approved.

The working group's ongoing work is poised to refine critical elements of the NZF's implementation guidance, including lifecycle assessment methodologies, fuel certification protocols, data verification processes, and the design of reward and pricing mechanisms.

Simultaneously, U.S. efforts to shape the negotiations through trade, port, visa and sanctions policy will inevitably influence consensus‑building. Stakeholders should remain engaged with IMO and member state deliberations while tracking developments across regional regimes, particularly in the EU.

For companies beyond shipping, the U.S. approach to the NZF reflects a broader pattern of leveraging international environmental issues to advance domestic industrial priorities and inform bilateral trade dynamics.

Conclusion

The MEPC's decision to adjourn and reconvene in 12 months preserves the path toward a unified global maritime decarbonization framework, while acknowledging the geopolitical and technical complexities at play.

With implementation work advancing at the working group, and member states engaged in intensive negotiations, the outcome will shape the trajectory of the maritime sector's climate transition, the coherence of global regulatory architecture, and the competitive landscape for shipping and its supply chain.

In the meantime, the persistence of regional regimes and the prospect of trade‑linked responses underscore the need for careful strategic planning and sustained engagement across policy, operational and investment horizons.",https://www.blankrome.com/themes/blankrome/img/logo-opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 16:56:59.740445

In the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Scope Expansion: Maritime consultation , published in November 2024, we consulted on technical implementation details for how to expand the existing UK ETS scheme to include emissions from maritime. This followed the Authority Response to the previous consultation , published in July 2023 where we confirmed that we would expand the UK ETS to emissions from domestic maritime from 2026.

The November 2024 consultation was split into two sections:

Section A: Implementing the UK ETS for Maritime. In this section, we consulted on the implementation of the scheme and provided more detail on the changes announced in the Developing the UK ETS Authority Response. This included additional information on the threshold, definition of a domestic voyage, exemptions from the scheme, cap adjustment, and the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements.

Section B: Potential further expansion of the UK ETS to additional maritime emissions. Here, we consulted on potential further expansions to additional maritime emissions. This included a proposal to review the threshold by 2028, and to consider how a proportion of emissions from international voyages could be included in future, if action from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) were delayed or insufficient.

Following the consultation, we analysed the feedback received ahead of making final policy decisions. Earlier this year, we published an interim Authority Response to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Scope Expansion: Maritime consultation. This document outlined the intention to expand the UK ETS to the domestic maritime sector from 1 July 2026. It confirmed this would include emissions from domestic voyages on a ship-activity basis, as well as all in-port emissions in the UK.

In addition, we set out that we also intend to expand the UK ETS to include emissions from international voyages, subject to negotiations as set out in the Common Understanding , and that proposals on this would be set out in due course.

The interim Authority Response also outlined the Authority’s decisions on the point of obligation for the scheme, the MRV requirements for the UK ETS, and details of the regulatory requirements. We issued this interim Authority Response to enable operators to prepare to comply with the requirements of the UK ETS and to allow regulators to conduct onboarding activities in preparation for the implementation of the scheme.

This Authority Response sets out the final policy detail ahead of the anticipated inclusion of domestic maritime emissions in the UK ETS from July 2026. We will be legislating for the inclusion of domestic maritime in the UK ETS and if there are any changes to policy design as part of this process, we will notify stakeholders.

Summary of decisions

The Authority can confirm that:

We will allow for ‘double-surrender’ in relation to the 2026 and 2027 scheme years, meaning that the deadline for the surrender of allowances in relation to the first scheme year (from 1 July 2026 to 31 December 2026) will also be 30 April 2028.

The inclusion of offshore ships within the UK ETS will be delayed until 1 January 2027, which aligns with the EU ETS expansion to offshore ships, avoiding distortion.

We will not require a Document of Compliance for the purposes of the UK ETS. Compliance with the scheme is managed by UK ETS regulators through the Manage your Emissions Trading Scheme (METS) system and the UK Emissions Trading Registry.

The threshold for inclusion will be 5000 gross tonnage (GT). There will be a review of the threshold in 2028 to consider whether this threshold should be lowered in future.

We will be providing a 50% deduction from UK ETS surrender obligation for voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to avoid a disparity in carbon pricing obligation on routes between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.

We will provide an exemption for ferry services to Scotland’s islands and certain peninsular communities. We will also provide an exemption for fish catching and fish processing ships. These exemptions will also be reviewed in 2028.

We will add 9,323,546 allowances to the UK ETS cap to account for the addition of emissions from the domestic maritime sector. The number of allowances is in line with the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy’s net zero consistent trajectory for the sector.

We also intend to include emissions from international voyages, subject to negotiations with the EU, as set out in the Common Understanding. We are publishing a consultation alongside the publication of this Authority Response on this expansion, which we propose will apply from 2028.

Section A: Implementing the UK ETS for maritime

Scope of the scheme

Further information on decisions in the interim Authority Response

Scheme Commencement and Compliance Deadlines

In the interim Authority Response, we confirmed that we intend for the expansion of the UK ETS to maritime to be from July 2026. Due to this, the first scheme year will run from 1 July 2026 to 31 December 2026. All subsequent scheme years run 1 January to 31 December each year. The deadline for submitting the verified annual emissions reports is 31 March after the scheme year ends, and the deadline to surrender allowances is 30 April after the scheme year ends.

However, the Authority has taken the decision to allow for ‘double-surrender’ for maritime operators for the first two scheme years only. This means that maritime operators must:

For the 2026 scheme year, submit their verified annual emissions report by 31 March 2027.

Surrender allowances in respect of the 2026 scheme year by 30 April 2028.

For the 2027 scheme year, submit their verified annual emissions report by 31 March 2028, and surrender allowances by 30 April 2028.

Double-surrender gives maritime operators that are new to the scheme extra time to familiarise themselves with the workings of the UK ETS, and to onboard onto the digital systems before needing to surrender allowances. However, operators will be able to purchase allowances at any point once they have the necessary account in the UK Emissions Trading Registry.

Offshore Ships

In the interim Authority Response, we recognised that there were concerns about the inclusion of offshore ships, particularly a risk of gaming, depending on how offshore ships and policy are defined. We committed to setting out further detail in the main response to this consultation.

After reviewing feedback about offshore ships, we will delay their inclusion until 1 January 2027, to match the EU ETS timeline. This will avoid any potential risks of market distortions or potential evasive behaviour prior to EU ETS inclusion.

We will be providing further information on the treatment of offshore ships in legislation and guidance, but we broadly intend to align with the approach under the EU ETS. This will reduce administrative complexity and therefore the risk of competitive distortion. This guidance will include the list of ship types covered by the term offshore ships, as well as further details on offshore facilities.

Document of Compliance

In the interim Authority Response, we also committed to setting out further information on whether we would remove the requirement for a Document of Compliance. The summary of the feedback to question 28 on this matter is on page 14 of the interim Authority Response.

The Authority can confirm that we will remove the requirement for a Document of Compliance.

In the UK ETS, verifiers will not verify the Emissions Monitoring Plan (EMP) and so cannot ascertain independently whether an EMP has been applied for or issued. Although the verifiers will verify the Annual Emissions Report (AER), they will not in all cases be able to ascertain independently whether the maritime operator has submitted a verified AER. We have therefore determined that a verifier-issued Document of Compliance is not required, as verifiers would not be able to assess whether maritime operators have complied with the UK ETS obligations.

Instead, maritime operators’ compliance with the UK ETS will be managed by the UK ETS regulators via the Manage your Emissions Trading Scheme (METS) system and the UK Emissions Trading Registry. However, as part of the consultation on expanding the UK ETS to include emissions from international maritime voyages, we are seeking stakeholder views on whether this approach would need to be adapted should this further expansion be introduced.

Disparity in carbon pricing obligation through differing emissions coverage on routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain

Summary of Proposals

In the previous consultation, we highlighted a disparity in carbon pricing obligation for vessels travelling across the Irish Sea due to the differing scope of the UK ETS and the EU ETS. This is due to the EU ETS covering 50% of emissions from international voyages starting or ending in an EU Member State, and the UK ETS including 100% of emissions from domestic voyages.

This means that voyages between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom would be subject to a carbon price for 50% of the emissions under the EU ETS. Without a policy intervention, a carbon price for 100% of the emissions will apply for routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the UK ETS. This could result in potential re-routing via Republic of Ireland or other gaming behaviour to avoid or reduce exposure to the higher carbon pricing obligation on routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

In the consultation, we therefore committed to avoiding a disparity and delivering parity in carbon pricing obligations across the Irish Sea. The consultation outlined two options for this:

Reduce the UK ETS surrender obligation for emissions from voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain by 50%. Participants would monitor and report all emissions on these voyages but would only have to surrender allowances in respect of 50% of them.

Expand the UK ETS to include 50% of emissions from voyages between the UK to the European Economic Area (EEA). Participants would monitor and report all emissions on these voyages but would only have to surrender allowances in respect of 50% of them.

Questions

5. Do you agree with our position that routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain should face equivalent carbon pricing obligations to that between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

6. Do you agree that subjecting in-scope ships on voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to 50% (as opposed to 100%) of their carbon pricing obligation under the UK ETS would be suitable for ensuring carbon pricing obligation equivalence and emissions coverage equivalence between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland? (Y/N)

Should this option be time limited or exist for as long as there remains a disparity in the carbon pricing obligation on these routes?

7. Do you believe expanding the scope of the UK ETS to include 50% emissions coverage on UK-EEA routes could a) lead to better decarbonisation outcomes for the sector and b) be a suitable alternative approach to ensuring equivalence in carbon pricing obligations to that outlined in question 6 above? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

8. Are there any other alternative approaches we should consider? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

9. Do you consider that there are differing impacts of these two approaches which we should consider when making a final decision? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

10. Do you foresee any additional consequences of this policy intervention that we should be aware of? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

57 respondents answered question 5. 51 (89%) respondents agreed that routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain should face equivalent carbon pricing obligations to those between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. Four (7%) of respondents disagreed with this position and two (4%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Respondents who agreed noted that the disparity could lead to modal shift or rerouting to avoid the carbon price and could lead to trade distortions.

50 respondents answered question 6. 33 (66%) respondents agreed that subjecting voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to 50% of their carbon pricing obligation would be suitable to ensure carbon pricing obligation equivalence. 13 (26%) respondents disagreed, and four (8%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Among those who disagreed, four respondents felt that this intervention should be reviewed and only remain in place for as long as the disparity remains. Three respondents felt that it would minimise decarbonisation effort due to lesser emissions coverage.

There were 61 respondents to question 7. 35 (57%) respondents agreed that expanding the scope of the UK ETS to include 50% emissions coverage on UK-EEA routes could lead to better decarbonisation outcomes for the sector and be a suitable alternative approach to ensuring equivalence in carbon pricing obligations to that outlined in question 6. 20 (33%) respondents did not agree and six (10%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Among those who disagreed, eight respondents felt that international emissions should be addressed through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), while four respondents felt that the expansion of the UK ETS should apply to 50% of all international emissions, as opposed to UK-EEA voyages only.

There were 19 respondents to question 8 regarding alternative approaches. Seven stakeholders suggested alignment with the EU ETS (which includes 50% of international voyages), and four further respondents also supported expansion to 50% of all international emissions.

Furthermore, there were 46 respondents to question 9, which asked whether these two options would have differing impacts. 37 (80%) respondents answered yes, while four (9%) answered no, and five (11%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Nine respondents felt that coverage of UK-EEA voyages would lead to trade and cost impacts, but 16 respondents felt that this option would encourage decarbonisation and fulfil the polluter pays principle. Five respondents felt that this option could reduce carbon leakage. 11 respondents felt that the option of reducing the surrender obligation to 50% for Northern Ireland-Great Britain voyages aligns better with the view that international emissions should be addressed through the IMO.

Finally, there were 40 respondents who answered question 10 on additional consequences of the policy intervention to ensure equivalency. 27 (68%) respondents answered yes to this question, 11 (27%) answered no, and two (5% ) respondents did not indicate a clear yes or no. One respondent felt that there could be an Isle of Man discrepancy through this intervention .

The Authority Response

The UK ETS Authority has taken the decision to provide a 50% deduction in surrender obligation for voyages in either direction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This will ensure carbon pricing obligation equivalence on voyages between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.

This intervention will only remain in place for as long as the disparity remains. For example, if emissions from international voyages were to be captured by the UK ETS in future, the surrender deduction for voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain will no longer apply, and those voyages will be subject to a 100% surrender obligation.

We recognise that there was support for including emissions from UK-EEA voyages, with 59% of respondents agreeing with question 7. Including more emissions in the scope of the UK ETS has the potential to drive even greater emissions reductions. We are publishing a consultation on the expansion of the UK ETS to emissions from voyages between the UK and international destinations alongside this Authority Response, which we propose will apply from 2028. We would welcome stakeholder views on this expansion along with how this may encourage decarbonisation in the sector.

Threshold for the scheme

Summary of Proposals

In the consultation, we outlined that the Authority is minded to apply the UK ETS to ships of 5000GT and above performing maritime activities from 2026. We proposed to review this threshold by the end of 2028, which was discussed in more detail in Section B.

We asked whether a de minimis threshold would be required to avoid the UK ETS being burdensome for maritime operators with very low in-scope emissions. We also asked for views on the treatment of emissions under this threshold.

Questions

11. Should we consider a de minimis threshold for operators with very low emissions to avoid a compliance burden? (Y/N) If so, what should this de minimis threshold be? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

12. If you support a de minimis threshold, should a simplified process apply or should the requirements of the UK ETS not apply at all? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

44 respondents answered question 11. 31 (71%) respondents agreed that we should consider a de minimis threshold for operators with very low emissions. 12 (27%) respondents disagreed, and one (2%) respondent was unsure. Nine respondents felt that this would reduce administrative burden for operators with very low emissions. However, of those that did not agree, nine respondents cited the principle that all emitters should comply with the scheme.

In question 11, we asked for views on how a de minimis threshold should work. We did not receive many detailed responses. Some themes included applying a de minimis threshold to either total emissions or number of port calls. Some respondents mentioned that a de minimis threshold would reduce administrative burden but did not specify or quantify what this additional administrative burden would be.

36 respondents answered question 12. 26 (72%) respondents supportive of a de minimis threshold agreed that either a simplified process should apply, or that the UK ETS should not apply at all. Six (17%) respondents said they did not agree, and four (11%) did not indicate a clear yes or no.

The Authority Response

The Authority confirms that the scheme will apply to ships of 5000GT and above performing maritime activities in scope of the UK ETS from July 2026 .

The Authority also confirms that we will not apply a de minimis threshold from implementation in July 2026. We will keep this under review as part of the review of the threshold in 2028. Although there was stakeholder support for a de minimis threshold, there was no clear consensus on what this should look like. Additionally, evidencing being under the de minimis threshold could be as or more burdensome than the policy itself. The Authority has decided that to keep this under review will allow time to evaluate the scheme, including gathering data on the spread of emissions from across UK ETS maritime operators. This data, experience, and further policy work can then be used during the review to determine whether a de minimis threshold would be required in future.

The Authority also confirms that a simplified monitoring approach will be available for ships which, in a scheme year, perform voyages between ports of call in the UK only, and perform 300 or more such voyages. This will simplify compliance for ships conducting a high number of predictable or repeat voyages.

Exemptions

Summary of Proposals

We responded in the interim Authority Response that we intend to exclude some activities from the UK ETS. Primarily, this is those activities which are performed by government such as military, customs, police, coastguard, emergency/medical and government research. We also stated that the activities of the General Lighthouse Authorities would be exempt. We provide some further detail on these exemptions in the Authority Response below.

In the consultation the Authority set out that, in general, it intends to avoid exemptions from the scheme, in order to protect the integrity of the UK ETS. However, it recognised that this may be warranted in a small number of situations. We therefore proposed to exempt ferries servicing Scottish islands from the UK ETS. We also asked whether an exemption should apply to isolated peninsular communities, and whether these services with an exemption should be required to comply with MRV requirements under the UK ETS. Finally, we pledged to review any eventual exemption in future, with the proposed 2028 review on the threshold being the first opportunity to do so.

We also asked whether there should be any further exemptions from the scheme, other than those listed above.

Questions

15. Do you have any views on the exemption of government non-commercial maritime activity, or the activity covered by this term? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

16. Do you think an exemption is necessary for specific ferry services serving island communities in Scotland? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

17. Do you think an exemption is necessary for specific ferry services serving peninsular communities in Scotland? (Y/N) If so, what would be a suitable definition of remote peninsular communities? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

18. If these services are exempted, do you think they should be subject to UK ETS MRV regulations? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

19. Do you have any further comments to make on an exemption for ferry services serving island and/or peninsula communities in Scotland?

20. Do you consider that there are any further subsectors which might be unduly impacted by the policy and require exemption? (Y/N) Please explain your answer, including on whether UK ETS MRV regulations should apply, and provide evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

We responded to question 15 in the interim Authority Response issued in July 2025. Some further details on this are outlined in the Authority Response below.

On question 16 regarding an exemption for ferry services serving island communities in Scotland, we received 44 responses, with 21 (48%) respondents agreeing and 20 (45%) respondents disagreeing. Three (7%) respondents did not indicate a clear yes or no. For those disagreeing with the proposed exemption, the main reason stated was that ferries were suitable early adopters of decarbonisation technology (six responses). Those who agreed with the proposed exemption chiefly stated reliance on the mainland (five responses) and ticket price impacts (six responses) as their main concern. We also received six responses from those agreeing with the exemption stating that this should be extended to other UK islands.

Question 17 asked if an exemption is necessary for ferries servicing remote Scottish peninsular communities. We received 34 responses to this question, with 13 (38%) respondents agreeing and 20 (59%) respondents disagreeing. One respondent did not indicate a clear yes or no. For those disagreeing with the proposed exemption, again the main reason stated was that ferries were suitable early adopters of decarbonisation technology (two responses). Those who agreed with extending the exemption to peninsulas mainly stated reliance on the mainland (four responses) as their reasoning.

The varied ways in which question 18 was interpreted by consultees meant that it was not clear whether some stakeholders had responded yes or no to whether an exemption should apply in the first place or to whether MRV should still apply if this is the case. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately present yes/no data for this question. However, from the qualitative responses we saw that the majority of respondents to this question agreed that MRV requirements would be sensible regardless of whether an exemption applies. Four respondents suggested that this would be a useful continuity with the EU MRV regulation.

Question 19 asked for any further comments in relation to an exemption for ferries servicing Scottish islands and peninsulas. The main themes which we received feedback on were that this exemption should be extended to other UK islands to ensure fairness across the UK (six responses). Some consultees noted the importance of island ferry services (four responses). Some stakeholders were also concerned about impacts on freight services (three responses) and suggested the scope of the exemption should be revisited if the threshold were reduced in future (three responses).

On question 20 regarding whether any other subsectors may be unduly impacted and require exemption, we received 43 responses, with 29 (67%) respondents that agreed and 13 (30%) respondents that disagreed. One respondent did not indicate a clear yes or no. The main theme to emerge from this question was potential impacts on the fishing industry if included in scope of the UK ETS, with nine (21%) respondents to this question calling for an exemption for fishing.

Rationales given for this included lack of decarbonisation options for fishing ships (four responses) and continuity with the EU ETS where fishing is exempt (six responses). Another key reason in the responses that called for a fishing exemption was the comparison to other, higher emitting forms of food production; some stakeholders asserted that fishing is one of the lowest emitting forms of protein production (six responses). It is worth noting that respondents did note that the impacts on fishing would be greater should the threshold be lowered in future (four responses).

Some stakeholders mentioned undue impacts on dredging (seven responses), particularly given the competition between land and sea in this industry. Although it was also highlighted that these impacts would be more of a risk if the threshold were lowered in future (three responses).

In response to this question, some stakeholders also reiterated their views on extending the exemption for Scottish island ferries to other UK islands (six responses). Finally, we received seven responses concerning offshore ships. We have included details of our treatment of offshore ships under the UK ETS on page 5 of this response.

The Authority Response

The UK ETS Authority responded to question 15 in the interim Authority Response issued in July 2025 . In addition to the exclusions laid out in this interim response, we can also confirm activities performed for the exclusive purpose of search and rescue, firefighting, and providing humanitarian aid will be exempt from the UK ETS.

The UK ETS Authority can confirm that we will provide an exemption for ferries serving Scotland’s islands and peninsulas. There are over 90 inhabited island and peninsula communities in Scotland that rely on ferry services, each with distinct geographic contexts and with populations ranging from fewer than 10 to just over 21,000 inhabitants. This decision recognises the unique and pressing challenges faced by these communities, which are reliant on ferries for access to essential goods, healthcare, education, and employment. Any disruption or additional burden placed upon these ferry services risks undermining the social and economic viability of island and peninsula communities. Such impacts can contribute to further population decline and reduced resilience in areas already facing demographic and geographic challenges. This is in addition to the legal duties to consider island populations under the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018.

This exemption will be reviewed again as part of the 2028 review of the scheme threshold, and the Scottish Government remain committed to the decarbonisation of Scotland’s ferry fleet playing a full part in helping achieve wider net zero targets. Planned decarbonisation activity for Scottish Government’s ferries - as well as the rest of the Scottish Transport sector - will be set out in the forthcoming Scottish Government Climate Change Plan and was included in the Islands Connectivity Plan’s Strategic Approach , and Vessels & Ports Plan – both published by the Scottish Government earlier this year. We will not be extending this exemption to other UK islands at this time. Any potential impacts on other UK islands will be considered in any future review.

Ferries over 5000GT serving Scotland’s islands and peninsulas have previously been required to comply with UK MRV regulation. The application of this exemption from the UK ETS means the ferries will not undertake MRV under the UK ETS. Despite this, it is the Authority’s intention, in line with stakeholder feedback, that these ferry services would still make efforts to monitor their emissions. We are working with Transport Scotland on the best way to achieve this objective and will update operators in due course on a decision.

The Authority can confirm that fish-catching and fish-processing ships will not be included in the UK ETS from implementation in July 2026. This is in light of stakeholder feedback, particularly relating to maintaining continuity for the fishing sector given that fishing ships are not captured by the EU ETS. Following the approach taken to the exemption of ferry services to Scotland’s islands and peninsula communities, this exemption will be subject to review as part of the 2028 review of the scheme threshold. This review point will consider the wider socio-economic impacts of inclusion and the differing capabilities of sectors to decarbonise.

We will continue to monitor the impacts on all maritime subsectors and decisions on exemptions would be revisited as part of the review of the scheme threshold in 2028.

Adjusting the cap for maritime

Summary of Proposals

In the consultation, we outlined an approach for the cap adjustment to account for the addition of maritime to the UK ETS. We stated that, for the remainder of Phase I of the UK ETS (2021-2030), we intended to adjust the UK ETS cap informed by emissions in scope per the most up-to-date decarbonisation pathway consistent with the delivery of climate targets . For the maritime sector, this was at that time from the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (CBDP).

We also stated that, if an updated maritime decarbonisation strategy were to be produced ahead of the Authority Response, we would seek to adjust instead per its more recent emissions pathway.

We provided indicative figures for the proposed cap adjustment approach, as in Table 1. The figures are based on the trajectory from the CBDP, which was the most recently published sectoral decarbonisation pathway at the time of the consultation, and which involved limited abatement in the 2020s, with significant emissions savings beginning in the early 2030s.

Following the publication of the consultation, the UK Government published its Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy in March 2025. This included an updated emissions pathway for the sector, and the analytical annex to the Strategy included an updated indicative UK ETS cap adjustment pathway, based on the updated emissions pathway.

We invited stakeholders to submit any views on this updated cap adjustment via email. Table 2 shows the proposed cap adjustment figures, based on the emissions pathway in the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.

Questions

21. Do you agree that the proposed approach, of adding allowances equivalent to emissions in scope per emissions trajectories aligned to the CBDP, is the most appropriate approach to adjusting the cap and to ensure the emissions reductions required to deliver climate targets? (Y/N). Please explain your response, including by proposing an alternative approach if appropriate.

22. Do you agree with the proposed approach to adjusting the cap to account for the inclusion in the scheme of emissions from the maritime sector? (Y/N). Please explain your response with reference to any alternative approaches or sources of evidence, or consideration of how to account for emissions from GB-NI and/or UK-EEA voyages.

23. Do you have views on whether allowances from cap adjustments in Phase I should all flow directly to auctions, or whether a proportion should flow to reserve pots? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

24. What would you expect to be the impact of the proposed approach to cap adjustment on participants in the sector and/or the wider UK ETS market? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

43 stakeholders responded to question 21 regarding the proposed general policy approach to adjusting the cap. Of those, 29 (67%) agreed with 12 (28%) disagreeing and two (5%) unsure. Of those who agreed with the proposals, 10 respondents referenced the importance of using the most up to date trajectory for the sector, or supported the adjustment being aligned to a net zero consistent trajectory. Despite supporting the approach, six responses also raised concerns about the potential for decarbonisation in the sector and the need for a robust package of policies to support maritime operators to reduce their emissions.

Of those that did not support the proposed approach, some considered the underpinning modelling of the CBDP inappropriate, meaning the trajectory was unsuitable, or did not consider it consistent with the 1.5 degree objective outlined in the Paris Agreement.

41 stakeholders responded to question 22, which asked whether the cap adjustment should reflect the emissions brought into scope upon expansion to the maritime sector. 29 (71%) responses agreed, 11 (27%) disagreed and one (2%) was unsure. Fewer stakeholders expanded on their response to this question, but some cautioned that any approach to cap adjustment should not disturb the supply-demand balance for the existing market (two responses). On accounting for emissions from GB-NI and/or UK-EEA voyages, two responses suggested basing this on historic emissions.

In response to question 23, on whether allowances should flow to auctions or to the reserve, we received 27 responses. Nine (38%) stakeholders supported all allowances being auctioned and two (8%) stakeholders wanted all allowances to flow to the reserve. Four (17%) responses advocated a mix, and four (17%) responses supported alignment with existing policy design.

The final question in this section asked about the impact of the proposed cap adjustment on maritime participants or the wider market. There were 25 responses to this question and respondents’ views on market impact varied. Six (29%) stakeholders felt that the proposed approach would have limited impact on the carbon price. Four (19%) stakeholders thought that the proposed approach risked limited decarbonisation. Two (10%) stakeholders had concerns over the impact of the proposed approach on market stability.

Following the publication of the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy and the invitation to submit views on its indicative cap adjustment trajectory, we received no stakeholder responses.

The Authority Response

The Authority will adjust the cap, by adding 9,323,546 allowances, in line with the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy’s net zero consistent trajectory for domestic maritime. We are doing this because this:

is consistent with the principle supported by respondents to question 21 that scope expansion should generally be accompanied by a corresponding adjustment to the cap

aligns with the UK’s Government’s Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy

reflects emissions from the sector in a transparent and predictable way

The Authority notes the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) recommendation to not adjust the cap when domestic maritime is added to the UK ETS. The CCC stated that the cap should not be adjusted due to excess allowances in the scheme and argued that the UK ETS price was low. The Authority values the CCC’s scrutiny and shares its view that an effective UK ETS is important to driving UK decarbonisation.

In response to the CCC’s advice on adjusting the cap to account for domestic maritime scope expansion, the Authority has comprehensively re-evaluated the existing UK ETS cap. This assessment was conducted in terms of consistency with the UK’s legislated carbon budgets and net zero targets, as well as alignment with long-term decarbonisation pathways and assumptions about the successful delivery of complementary policies across the traded sector. On the basis that the inclusion of domestic maritime emissions from 2026 represents a material change in the scope of the scheme, and hence an increase in the demand for allowances under the cap, the Authority has determined that an adjustment is necessary to preserve cap integrity and consistency with the wider objectives of the scheme. This cap adjustment will preserve market stability and ensure consistency with the policy intent of the UK ETS, promoting cost-effective decarbonisation within the covered sectors.

The cap adjustment takes into account the final scope of the scheme, as outlined in this consultation. This means that the cap adjustment accounts for in-scope emissions by ships of 5000GT and above, the surrender deduction between GB and NI and the exemptions, including those for ferries serving Scotland’s islands and peninsula communities, and for fishing. The final cap adjustment is as per Table 3 below.

Table 3: Final adjustment pathway based on the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy and taking into account the final scope of the scheme.

2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Total Final cap adjustment (millions of UKAs) 1.00 2.19 2.12 2.05 1.96 9.32

All allowances from this maritime cap adjustment will be added to auction volumes. As the maritime sector will not receive free allocation, any allowances added to reserve pots would not have been accessible to the sector. The level of the UK ETS’ flexible reserve, which can be used for market stability mechanisms, was confirmed in Chapter 1 of the Developing the UK ETS Authority Response.

For further information on the cap adjustment and impacts of this adjustment, please see the Impact Assessment.

Participating in the scheme

Guidance

Summary of Proposals

In the consultation, we stated that we intend to provide guidance to address sector-specific requirements and support participants to comply with their obligations under the UK ETS. We asked consultees to provide any information on which elements of the scheme it would be most helpful for the Authority to provide guidance on.

Questions

34. On which aspects of the policy proposals should we produce guidance, and to what timescale? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

We received 33 responses to question 34. Key themes arising from this question included that guidance needed to be provided in advance of the scheme starting (20 responses) and that early and comprehensive communication was required (two responses). On the topic of what specific guidance should be produced, 10 stakeholders called for us to mirror the approach that the European Commission have taken to EU ETS guidance. Some stakeholders were more specific with their responses, calling for guidance on MRV (10 responses), How to Comply guidance (seven responses) and guidance on the digital system (four responses).

The Authority Response

We will ensure that guidance is available to assist maritime operators in their participation in the UK ETS. Each of the regulators will issue guidance and communications about how to comply. This will be broadly in line with that produced for operators of installations and aircraft operators.

The UK ETS Authority will also update the Participating in the UK ETS guidance on gov.uk and clearly signpost updates to more detailed guidance. In addition, we will provide additional information and guidance on complying with the UK ETS as part of our stakeholder engagement following the publication of this document.

Impacts of the scheme

Decarbonisation impacts

Summary of Proposals

The Authority outlined that the UK ETS is designed on the polluter pays principle, and prices the ‘carbon externality’ that greenhouse gas emissions represent. Expanding the scheme to new sectors should lead to positive decarbonisation outcomes for those sectors. We anticipate that the expansion of the UK ETS will help to address the issue that the cost of maritime fuels does not currently reflect the environmental cost of emissions from these fuels, strengthening the incentive for zero or near-zero GHG emission fuels and technologies. In the very short-term, we also expect that the UK ETS will help to incentivise operational efficiencies during voyages, such as slow-steaming. The signal sent by the UK ETS cap will also allow operators to plan on a longer time horizon and will therefore help to incentivise the use of currently emerging technologies such as battery-powered ships or hydrogen and hydrogen-derived engines.

The consultation outlined that the UK ETS will not operate in isolation; there will be a requirement for other policies to overcome various other barriers to decarbonisation in the sector. This will include measures to drive the uptake of future fuels and energy sources, increased energy efficiency and promoting innovation, research and development, and the key role of port-side infrastructure in enabling the decarbonisation of ships.

Questions

35. Does the section above capture all relevant short and long term decarbonisation impacts of the UK ETS? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

36. How else could the UK ETS support decarbonisation in the sector? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

37. Do you consider that the application of the UK ETS will have any further environmental impacts, positive or negative? (Y/N) If negative, are there any mitigations that could be taken? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

35 stakeholders responded to question 35 regarding whether the consultation captured all relevant decarbonisation impacts of the scheme. Nine (26%) responses agreed that all impacts were captured, 24 (69%) responses disagreed and two (5% ) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Where stakeholders expanded on their response, key themes included that there must be investment to ensure that alternative fuels are available (seven stakeholders) and that there must be support for the provision of shore power (seven stakeholders). Six responses referenced that the technology to decarbonise the maritime sector is nascent.

For question 36, we received 46 responses to answer how the UK ETS could further support decarbonisation in the sector. A key theme in these responses, mentioned by 27 stakeholders, was that the sector should have access to the revenue raised by the UK ETS to support the decarbonisation of the sector. 30 respondents called for more support for innovation which will support the sector in its decarbonisation, and 28 respondents referenced the need to support alternative fuels. Support for shore power provision was also mentioned by 17 stakeholders in response to this question.

There were 34 responses to question 37 on whether there are any further environmental impacts of the expansion of the UK ETS to maritime. 29 (85%) responses considered that there were further environmental impacts, three (9%) responses disagreed and two (6%) responses did not indicate a clear yes or no. Of those that thought there were further environmental impacts, 18 thought these would be positive environmental impacts, and 19 thought these would be negative impacts. Stakeholders who said these would be positive environmental impacts referenced that the policy would drive decarbonisation, support innovation in the sector and drive better air quality. Of those that felt there would be further negative environmental impacts, a key theme was concern that UK ETS expansion to maritime would disincentivise short-sea domestic shipping and incentivise road journeys, with the latter being more carbon intensive. Carbon leakage was another theme, which is covered more in the section below.

The Authority Response

The UK ETS Authority continues to see UK ETS expansion to maritime as a key part of the decarbonisation pathway for the maritime sector. Since this consultation was published, the UK Government has published its Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy. The Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy sets out the pathway to decarbonise the domestic maritime sector, providing certainty and clarity for the sector. UK ETS expansion to maritime was one of the five ambitious policy measures announced in the Strategy as a key driver of cost-effective decarbonisation.

We consider that the UK ETS expansion to domestic maritime will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the sector. By placing a price on emissions from the sector, the UK ETS expansion to maritime will address the key market failure which is that domestic maritime fuel prices do not reflect the social costs of their greenhouse gas emissions. This carbon price signal will incentivise operators to invest in cleaner technologies and practices where it is most cost-effective, given abatement options across all sectors in the scheme.

The UK ETS expansion to maritime could also help to mitigate other market barriers to decarbonisation. The UK ETS provides a long-term, credible carbon price signal to the sector, allowing operators to plan their investment, reduce uncertainty and make the financial case for investment in decarbonisation, acting alongside international action taken at the IMO. The scheme’s design also helps to overcome other market barriers, such as split incentives and coordination failures, by aligning incentives across the sector and encouraging parallel action.

In addition to the direct decarbonisation benefits, the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime is expected to deliver further positive environmental impacts. Specifically, abatement actions taken in response to the UK ETS are projected to reduce emissions of key air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and particulate matter, thereby supporting improvements in air quality.

Furthermore, the UK ETS also acts as a safeguard mechanism within the wider policy landscape. This means that, should other decarbonisation policies underperform, the cap ensures that overall emissions reductions are still achieved.

The above provides a brief summary of the expected decarbonisation impacts of the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime, as well as any wider environmental impacts. Further detail on the decarbonisation impacts of this policy can be found in the Impact Assessment published alongside this Authority Response.

We do recognise that there were calls from stakeholders to have access to the revenue raised by the UK ETS expansion to maritime to support the decarbonisation of the sector. The UK ETS revenue is not directly returned to any of the sectors which are currently covered by the UK ETS. However, UK ETS revenues already support key government priorities, including decarbonisation. There is also funding available for the sector to support their decarbonisation. One such example is the UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions (UK SHORE) programme in the Department for Transport which has allocated £448million to support clean maritime research and development from 2026 to 2030. This builds on £240m already delivered through UK SHORE between 2022 and 2026.

Potential distributional impacts and carbon leakage risk

Summary of Proposals

In the consultation, we stated that we are committed to ensuring that this policy does not unduly impact certain sections of society or sub-sectors disproportionately. We provided information on our assessment of the potential carbon leakage risks, which we deemed to be relatively low, given the similarity of our proposals to those taken forward by the EU as many EU countries are our nearest neighbours. We also outlined that we did not consider modal shift to other transport types to be a high risk but asked for evidence from consultees on the level of risk of carbon leakage and modal shift to other transport types from applying the UK ETS to maritime.

Questions

38. Do you consider that application of the UK ETS will lead to any adverse impacts for any particular communities or regions, or sub-sectors of the maritime economy. (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

39. Do you consider that application of the UK ETS will lead to any carbon leakage or modal shift to other transport types? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

43 stakeholders responded to question 38 regarding whether the expansion of the UK ETS to maritime would have any adverse impacts on communities, regions or sub-sectors. 35 (82% ) responses agreed there would be adverse impacts, seven (16%) responses disagreed and one (2%) was unsure. Where stakeholders expanded on their response, key themes included impact on island communities (9 responses) and the impact on the fishing sector (seven responses). Four stakeholders also referenced the impact on Northern Ireland and five stakeholders suggested that there would be an impact on consumers.

For question 39, we received 45 responses on whether the application of the UK ETS would lead to carbon leakage or modal shift. 34 (76%) stakeholders responded that this would happen, nine (20%) stakeholders did not consider this to be a risk and two (4%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Again, a key theme here was moving goods from maritime to road or rail transport and leading to modal shift (20 responses each). Seven stakeholders referenced increased costs for short-sea shipping, which would make it less attractive and other stakeholders referenced a risk of harming UK competitiveness (seven responses).

The Authority Response

The UK ETS Authority recognises the feedback provided regarding the distributional impacts of the policy. We recognise that some stakeholders remain concerned about the impacts of the policy on some parts of the UK, and the risk of modal shift from the application of the UK ETS to domestic maritime.

In terms of competitive disadvantage, evidence suggests that the risk of this is relatively low. This is based on the high level of alignment with the EU ETS, the high degree of overlap between UK and EU domestic maritime activity for UK operators and the action taken to ensure there is no disparity in carbon pricing across the Irish Sea.

We recognise that there is also a potential for carbon leakage and internal carbon displacement through the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime. Evidence suggests these risks are limited under current market and policy conditions. In particular, modal shift away from domestic maritime to other transport modes is considered unlikely, given the limited availability of substitutes and the small share of waterborne freight in the UK. In addition to this, the assessment of carbon leakage risks supports the case for expanding the UK ETS to domestic maritime. The evidence indicates that the potential for emissions displacement through route changes or transhipment is limited under current market and policy conditions. These findings suggest that the expansion is unlikely to undermine the environmental integrity or competitiveness of the UK domestic maritime sector.

We do understand from the stakeholder feedback that competitive disadvantage, modal shift and carbon leakage are key industry concerns. We will therefore keep these impacts under review following the implementation of the scheme.

In terms of the impact on regions, we recognise that some stakeholders were concerned about the impact on island communities outside of Scotland. As outlined in the Exemptions section, we consider that there is a high bar for any exemptions from the UK ETS and are exempting Scotland’s islands and peninsula communities on the basis of the unique and pressing challenges they face. We will keep the impacts of the scheme under review following the implementation of the scheme.

The above provides a brief summary of the expected distributional impacts of the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime. Further detail on the distributional impacts of this policy can be found in the Impact Assessment published alongside this Authority Response. Per Scottish legislative requirements, an Islands Community Impact Assessment (assessing the impact on Scottish islands of the inclusion of maritime in the UK ETS) will be published alongside the relevant secondary legislation to implement this policy.

Equality considerations

Summary of Proposals

We outlined our legal requirements under the public sector equality duty (PSED) which requires public authorities to consider how policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act 2010. We asked whether the application of the UK ETS to the maritime sector could lead to any impacts for groups with protected characteristics.

Questions

40. Do you consider that the application of the UK ETS to the maritime sector will lead to any impacts for any groups with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010? And do you consider any elements of the UK ETS expansion to the maritime sector could be designed to achieve the objectives set out under s149 of the Equality Act 2010? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

There were 13 responses to this question. Of these responses, 10 (71%) stakeholders suggested that they did not consider that there would be any impact on groups with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. Three (21%) responses referenced the impact on island communities and in particular the protected characteristics of age and disability, based on being more likely to require mainland connectivity for healthcare appointments. One (8% ) response called for continued monitoring of any impacts and mitigation should they been identified.

The Authority Response

The UK ETS Authority does not consider that there are undue impacts on any groups with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. The policy primarily affects maritime operators, based both in the UK and internationally, and therefore directly impacts businesses rather than specific groups or individuals. As such, we do not consider the equality duty has direct relevance to the policy function. However, there are some potential downstream effects on consumers, resulting from operator business decisions. We gave due consideration to this with the equality duty in mind. We do not have any evidence to suggest this would be applied in a way that discriminates against individuals based on protected characteristics. We are committing to continual monitoring of the policy to ensure there are no unintended consequences, including on groups protected under the Equality Act 2010.

Section B: Potential further expansion of the UK ETS to additional maritime emissions

Future review of the threshold for the scheme

Summary of Proposals

In the consultation, we proposed to review the threshold for the scheme by the end of 2028, to coincide with the 2028 whole system review of the operations of the UK ETS. This review would consider how the scheme is working for ships at 5000GT and above, the practicalities of undertaking MRV for ships between 400GT and 5000GT, as well as allowing us to better understand the impacts of lowering the threshold on operators and certain sub-sectors. We asked for views on this proposed review, as well as information on what a suitable lower threshold could be and the impact this may have on decarbonisation.

Questions

41. Do you agree that a lower threshold could support the maritime sector to decarbonise? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

42. Do you agree that if we were to lower the threshold, it should be to 400GT? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

43. Is it practical for ships between 400GT and 5000GT to undertake monitoring, reporting and verification requirements? (Y/N) Should there be a simplified monitoring regime should the threshold be lowered? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

44. Would any inland waterways or leisure craft be captured by a 400GT threshold? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing data where possible.

45. When would be an appropriate date for lowering the threshold if we were to lower it in the future? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

46. What will be the impacts of lowering the threshold? Would any sub-sectors be disproportionately impacted? Please explain your response giving evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

51 respondents answered question 41. 33 (65%) respondents agreed that a lower threshold could support the maritime sector to decarbonise, 12 (23%) respondents disagreed and six (12%) respondents did not indicate a clear yes or no. Five respondents went on to say that it would encourage the adoption of low carbon technologies, and eight respondents felt that it would capture more emissions. However, nine respondents mentioned that the necessary technology was not in place and that lack of infrastructure could cause a barrier. Four respondents also flagged it should ensure there is no double charging with other international schemes.

41 respondents answered question 42, with 21 (51%) respondents agreeing that if we were to lower the threshold it should be to 400GT. 17 (42%) respondents disagreed and three (7%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. 10 respondents went on to say they felt this aligned with EU MRV and six respondents said this was also a threshold used internationally. However, four respondents felt that it could lead to increased admin burden for ships below 5000GT and eight respondents felt that it could affect certain sub-sectors at a lower threshold.

44 respondents answered question 43. 32 (73%) respondents felt that it was practical for ships between 400GT-5000GT to undertake monitoring and reporting and verification requirements, while 11 (25%) respondents did not agree and one (2%) respondent was unsure. Seven respondents pointed to these ships already being included in EU MRV for certain ship types and three respondents felt this would incentivise these ships to decarbonise. However, 12 respondents felt that simplified reporting would be required for these ships, with three respondents stating that ships under 1000GT specifically would struggle to comply with MRV.

There were 18 respondents to question 44 on whether any inland waterways or leisure craft would be captured by a 400GT threshold. 10 (56%) respondents felt they would be captured, while four (22%) respondents disagreed and four (22%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. Six respondents noted that large yachts could be captured. Three respondents felt that a fair approach should be taken regardless of reporting area. However, three respondents did note that potentially another mechanism, like that of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) scheme, could be applied instead.

40 respondents answered question 45 regarding an appropriate future date for lowering the threshold. Nine respondents felt we should align with the EU, whilst five respondents felt we should align with the IMO. Five respondents felt this should be in place once more decarbonisation options are available and two respondents suggested an MRV-only period initially. 12 respondents gave specific dates ranging from 2027-2031.

Finally, 34 respondents answered question 46 on whether there would be any impacts of lowering the threshold. Six respondents felt that this would create costs which would not be possible to “pass on” to consumers and six respondents also stated that alternative fuels and technologies were currently not available. Four respondents felt that this would affect island communities. Four respondents also felt that any potential misalignment with the EU could put UK ships at a disadvantage.

The Authority Response

We will review the scheme in 2028 to consider lowering the threshold to 400GT for in-scope ships in the future.

We have heard from stakeholders that there were concerns around the potential for double charging of emissions through international schemes if the threshold were lowered in the future and the practicalities for ships under 5000GT to undertake MRV. We also recognise the stakeholder interest in a simplified reporting process. We are aware that there could be varying impacts on certain sub-sectors at a lower threshold. Finally, we recognise that stakeholders consider it important to ensure that lowering of the threshold is implemented to align with international schemes and also with consideration to the availability of decarbonisation options.

We will therefore take these considerations into account as part of the review. We will notify stakeholders of the outcome of that review after 2028 and outline next steps.

Coverage of international voyages

Summary of Proposals

We outlined in the previous consultation that the primary route to addressing international emissions remains multilateral action taken at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). For that reason, we confirmed that we were not considering expanding in-scope emissions for all international voyages beyond potentially that of voyages between the UK and EEA for 2026. However, should multilateral action through the IMO be delayed or prove insufficient in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, we asked consultees for information on how potential future inclusion of international emissions could work, if this was something we chose to take forward in future.

Questions

In the event that the conditions highlighted above at the IMO were realised;

47. Should the UK ETS be expanded to include emissions from all international voyages starting or ending in the UK in future? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

48. If you agree with the above, do you think 50% of emissions from voyages by in-scope ships making an international voyage which starts or ends in the UK from overseas should be covered? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

49. If you support the inclusion of international voyages, do you have a view on when this should be implemented? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Summary of Responses

57 respondents answered question 47. 34 (60%) respondents agreed that the UK ETS should be expanded to include emissions from all international voyages starting or ending in the UK in future. 20 (35%) respondents disagreed and three (5%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. 29 respondents noted that this would ensure EU alignment, and 10 respondents noted it would avoid carbon leakage or potential loopholes. 16 respondents felt that this would incentivise decarbonisation, and seven respondents felt it would demonstrate climate ambition. 19 respondents noted the possible crossover with the IMO measure, with 14 explicitly stating that we should avoid double counting of emissions.

There were 41 respondents to question 48. 29 (71%) respondents agreed that 50% of emissions from international voyages should be covered by the UK ETS. 11 (27%) respondents disagreed and one (2%) did not indicate a clear yes or no. As with question 47, 24 respondents noted that this aligned with the EU, with five respondents noting that this alignment would avoid carbon leakage.

Finally, 41 respondents answered question 49 on timing for the inclusion of international voyages. 17 respondents noted that we should implement as early as possible. Reasons for this included EU alignment and early implementation avoiding potential carbon leakage; incentivising decarbonisation and demonstrating climate ambition. Seven respondents felt we should consider the outcome of the IMO global measure before considering expanding to beyond domestic emissions.

The Authority Response

The Authority welcomes the feedback received on the inclusion of relevant greenhouse gas emissions from international voyages. Since then there have been significant changes in the wider policy sphere, and in particular internationally. In October 2025, adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework (NZF) was delayed at the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee. The UK was disappointed in this outcome and will continue to work with others to progress development of the IMO Net Zero Framework so that we can reach a position of consensus in the future. In our previous consultation, we committed to exploring how potential future inclusion of international emissions could work, should multilateral action through the IMO be delayed, or prove insufficient in reducing GHG emissions from international shipping.

Alongside this, in May 2025 the UK and EU agreed to work towards linking the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) and EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) at the UK-EU Summit. In the interim Authority Response published in July 2025, we set out that we intend to expand the UK ETS to include emissions from international maritime voyages, building on the Common Understanding established at the summit which stated that both domestic and international maritime would be in scope of a linked scheme.

Given these events, the UK ETS Authority intends for relevant greenhouse gas emissions from international voyages to be included within the UK ETS at a later date. We are issuing a consultation alongside the publication of this Authority Response to seek stakeholder views on this expansion, and how we intend to expand to relevant greenhouse gas emissions from international voyages, which we propose will be from 2028.

We recognise stakeholders have concerns about additional administrative burden for operators and we are keen to minimise this. In doing so, we aim to create effective and coherent measures that deliver investor certainty and tangible progress to decarbonise the maritime sector.

the IMO NZF or EU ETS) affect the impacts of the proposed UK ETS expansion to international maritime voyages?","Introduction

The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) came into operation on 1 January 2021. The scheme is a key part of our approach to addressing climate change, setting a limit on emissions from the sectors covered and ensuring an appropriate price is applied to them. The scheme is jointly run by the UK ETS Authority (or ‘the Authority’), comprised of the UK Government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs for Northern Ireland.

In July 2023, following a consultation, the Authority confirmed its intention to expand the scope of the UK ETS to include emissions from domestic maritime from 2026 . This was followed by a further consultation in November 2024 on the technical details of implementation, as well as potential future expansion to additional maritime emissions.

The Authority confirmed some of the technical aspects of the scheme in an interim Authority Response . This included the intention to expand the UK ETS to include emissions from international voyages. We set out further, full details of the expansion of the domestic scheme in the main Authority Response to the previous consultation, published alongside this document.

International maritime voyage emissions: context

In the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Scope Expansion: Maritime consultation, published in November 2024, we consulted on technical implementation details for how to expand the existing UK ETS scheme to include emissions from maritime. While the majority of the consultation focused on implementing the expansion of the scheme to domestic emissions, we also considered how a proportion of emissions from international voyages could be brought into this scheme in future.

In March 2025, the UK Government published the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy . This set out the pathway to a clean maritime future, required to deliver against the UK’s legally binding carbon budgets, providing certainty and clarity for the sector. The strategy focused on five key policies, one of which was placing a price on emissions from the maritime sector, such as through the UK ETS.

Since then there have been significant changes in the wider policy sphere, and in particular internationally. In October 2025, adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework was delayed at the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee. The UK was disappointed in this outcome and will continue to work with others to progress development of the IMO Net Zero Framework so that we can reach a position of consensus in the future. In our previous consultation, we committed to exploring how potential future inclusion of international emissions could work, should multilateral action through the IMO be delayed, or prove insufficient in reducing GHG emissions from international shipping.

Alongside this, in May 2025 the UK and EU agreed to work towards linking the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) and EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) at the UK-EU Summit. In the interim Authority Response published in July 2025, we set out that we intend to expand the UK ETS to include emissions from international maritime voyages, building on the Common Understanding established at the summit which stated that both domestic and international maritime would be in scope of a linked scheme.

Given these events, this consultation sets out policy proposals on the expansion of UK ETS to include emissions for international maritime voyages.

Purpose of this consultation

As part of the November 2024 consultation, we included questions on the potential future inclusion of emissions from international maritime voyages. The majority of respondents were in favour and argued that this would ensure EU alignment, avoid carbon leakage and potential loopholes, incentivise decarbonisation, and demonstrate climate ambition. However, there were some concerns raised, including that the UK should wait to align with any measure agreed at the (then upcoming) April 2025 IMO Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session.

This consultation builds on the November 2024 consultation and outlines specific proposals for how we intend to expand the UK ETS to include emissions from international maritime voyages in line with the Common Understanding of May 2025 and the delay to adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework.

Respondents need only reply to the questions that interest them or that they have views on. There is no requirement nor expectation to respond to every question in this consultation.

Summary of Proposals

Expansion to International Maritime Voyages Proposal

The UK ETS Authority is consulting on including emissions from international maritime voyages starting or ending in the UK. We propose that this expansion should take place from 2028. We also intend that international voyages are only subject to the UK ETS carbon price for 50% of their emissions, in line with the current EU ETS scope.

We propose that the expansion to international voyages would apply to ships which will already be in scope of the UK ETS because of their domestic voyages or emissions in ports in the UK and would cover the same greenhouse gases. These have been set out in the interim and main Authority Response to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Scope Expansion: Maritime consultation.

Scope of the Proposal

We propose that an international voyage in scope of these proposals would be a voyage in either direction between a UK port and a port outside of the UK. We also propose that emissions from voyages to and from Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories are to be captured under these proposals. As outlined in previous consultations and in the main Authority Response, we consider that there should be a high bar for any exemptions from the UK ETS. We are keen to gather stakeholder views on this approach through the consultation, including evidence of the impacts on these communities.

In practice, we propose that participants would monitor and report 100% of their greenhouse gas emissions on a voyage between a UK port and a port outside of the UK. However, operators would only be required to surrender allowances to cover 50% of their emissions. In addition to this, participants would be required to surrender allowances for 100% of their emissions while in port in the UK, as already confirmed in the interim Authority Response, published in July 2025.

The UK is committed to free and open trade, our domestic and international climate change commitments, and the needs of industry and consumers. Upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the legal framework for all activities in the ocean and seas underpins all aspects of the UK’s ocean policy. Therefore, we will ensure that any measures taken forward are in compliance with our international obligations, including our rights and obligations under UNCLOS, our commitments under the World Trade Organisation and trade agreements, and climate treaties including the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.

Based on estimates from the DfT’s maritime emissions model, in 2019, the UK’s share of international maritime voyage emissions was approximately 7.5MtCO2e on a tank-to-wake basis. Of these emissions, it is estimated approximately 6.9MtCO2e (92%) were produced by ships over 5000GT and would be brought into scope of the UK ETS, subject to any exemptions. Given all in-port emissions including those from ships on international voyages are included within the scope of domestic maritime scheme, all emissions brought into scope under this expansion would be emissions produced during voyages.

For ships over 5000GT, it is estimated that approximately 3.5MtCO2e were emitted on voyages between the UK and the EEA, and 3.4MtCO2e on voyages between the UK and the Rest of the World . Container ships (1.74MtCO2e), ro-pax ferries (0.96MtCO2e), and oil tankers (0.88MtCO2e) were the vessel types estimated to make the largest contribution to the UK’s share of international maritime voyage emissions.

Whilst a vote on adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) has been delayed, the UK will continue to work with others to progress its development, and adoption. Once adopted it is expected to cover the emissions from ships 5000GT and above that performed any international voyages in a given year. This includes domestic emissions from vessels that performed a mix of domestic (UK-UK port voyages) and international (UK-international port voyages). We will review the coverage of maritime emissions in UK ETS following adoption of the NZF.

Implications for GB-NI Routes

We have previously consulted on two options to overcome the disparity in carbon pricing obligations on routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, due to differing emissions coverage by the EU ETS and UK ETS. The main Authority Response outlines that to ensure carbon pricing equivalence on these routes, the UK ETS Authority will provide a 50% surrender deduction for voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, from implementation in July 2026.

The main Authority Response stated that this measure will only remain in place for as long as the disparity remains. This means the 50% surrender deduction for routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain will no longer apply from the point at which international voyages are brought into the UK ETS, which is proposed to be 2028. This will mean that a 100% surrender obligation will apply for voyages between Northern Ireland and Great Britain after this point.

Implications for the scope of the scheme

As set out in the main Authority Response, we are going to provide further information for offshore ships in guidance and legislation. For the purposes of this consultation, we propose that a surrender obligation will also apply to offshore ships for 50% of their greenhouse gas emissions from international voyages.

Through this consultation, the UK ETS Authority is interested to understand whether the scope of the scheme, as outlined in the main Authority Response, would need to be amended if proceeding with the expansion to include emissions from international voyages. For example, we acknowledge the EU ETS ice class vessel policy which allows such ships to surrender 5% fewer allowances until 31 December 2030. At this stage, we are not intending to introduce a similar reduction in surrender allowance for the UK ETS. However, we are interested in gathering views on whether some adjustments need to be made for ice class ships, or for any other ship types in an international context.

Implications for regulatory provisions

Finally, we would also be interested to understand whether any of the regulatory provisions set out in the main Authority Response would need to change in response to proposals to extend the UK ETS to include emissions from international voyages. For example, in the main Authority Response, we set out that we will remove the requirement for a Document of Compliance for the domestic expansion. This is because compliance with the UK ETS will be managed by the UK ETS regulators via the Manage your Emissions Trading Scheme (METS) system and the UK Emissions Trading Registry.

Through this consultation, we would be keen to understand whether that approach would need to change if expanding the UK ETS to include emissions for international journeys. We are also aware that other regional schemes, such as the EU ETS, contain further powers for enforcement including powers of expulsion and port bans. We are keen to understand whether stakeholders consider such powers would be beneficial in the enforcement of the scheme. We would also welcome any other views on further suggested regulatory changes.

Questions

1. Do you agree with our proposal to include 50% of emissions from international voyages within the UK ETS from 1 January 2028? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

2. Do you think that the emissions from voyages to and from Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories should be included in the scope of the scheme? (Y/N) Will it lead to any gaming, avoidance or adverse impacts if they were exempted? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

3. Do you agree that offshore ships should be included in the scope of the expanded scheme? (Y/N) Will it lead to any gaming, avoidance or adverse impacts? Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

4. Do you agree with the intention to not provide a 5% reduction in allowance surrender for ice class vessels? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

5. Does the scope of the scheme as outlined in the main Authority Response need to be further amended in light of proposals to include international voyages? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

6. Do the regulatory provisions as outlined in the main Authority Response need to change in light of proposals to include international voyages? For example, does the requirement for a Document of Compliance need to be reinstated, or further regulatory powers such as port bans or expulsion need to be added? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Cap adjustment

In the main Authority Response, we confirmed that we will adjust the cap to account for the expansion of the ETS to domestic maritime. The number of allowances that will be added is in line with the UK Government’s Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy and its net zero consistent trajectory for domestic maritime.

This reflected our proposal in the consultation and is consistent with the principle supported by stakeholders in the previous consultation that scope expansion should generally be accompanied by a corresponding adjustment to the cap.

As outlined in the main response, the Authority noted the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) recommendation to not adjust the cap when domestic maritime is added to the UK ETS. However, following the CCC’s advice, the Authority reevaluated the current UK ETS cap trajectory to test its net zero consistency and found there was no material change in the underlying assumptions that informed the original net zero consistent cap trajectory. As such, the Authority believed there was limited justification for reopening the cap position agreed as part of the Developing the UK ETS consultation response.

The Authority proposes following a similar approach for expanding the UK ETS to include emissions from international voyages. We are therefore minded to adjust the cap using the latest net zero-consistent trajectory for emissions from international voyages, as set out in the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy . This will ensure that the overall UK ETS cap remains net zero consistent and continues to support the delivery of the UK’s climate targets.

The Authority has decided to extend the UK ETS into a Phase II from 2031 onwards, and we will seek to consult on a specific Phase II cap trajectory as soon as possible. Any Phase II cap trajectory will need to align with cross-economy decarbonisation plans across all four nations. The Authority believes the cap adjustment will preserve scheme credibility and ensure consistency with the policy intent of the emissions trading scheme, promoting cost-effective decarbonisation.

The figures presented for emissions coverage under a 50% international voyage scope expansion are indicative only and do not reflect a finalised policy position. They are based on modelling from the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy (MDS) published in early 2025 and are subject to change as policy and modelling evolve. These estimates are intended to provide a sense of scale for potential cap adjustments in Phase I of the scheme (which runs to the end of the scheme year beginning 1 January 2030), under the existing legislated UK ETS cap. Future updates to modelling may result in revised figures, and any final policy decisions will be informed by further analysis and consultation.

Questions

7. Do you agree with our proposal to adjust the cap using the net zero consistent trajectory as set out in the more up to date published trajectory at the point of the Authority Response to this consultation? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

Future Review

The IMO Net Zero Framework (NZF) once adopted will help to incentivise ships to transition to cleaner fuels, with revenues kickstarting the sector’s transition to green fuels and technologies, and promoting a just and equitable transition in developing countries, in particular Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.

Whilst the UK will work with others to progress the development and adoption of the NZF, the recent delay to adoption means that there is a need for immediate action to be taken to drive forward global maritime decarbonisation efforts.

We recognise stakeholders have concerns about additional administrative burden for operators and we are keen to minimise this. In doing so, we aim to create effective and coherent measures that deliver investor certainty and tangible progress to decarbonise the maritime sector.

The EU has committed to review the approach to the EU ETS for maritime, following adoption of the NZF . This includes legislative proposals to examine the need to apply the allocation of allowances and surrender requirements to more than fifty percent (50%) of the emissions from ships performing international voyages, and is due to be issued within 18 months of the NZF adoption.

Following adoption of the IMO NZF we will review the interaction of the UK ETS and the IMO NZF, and will explore the options for managing any future interactions, including reviewing any future changes to the EU ETS.

Questions

8. What measures should the UK Government undertake to ensure that both the UK ETS and the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, following adoption, can effectively support the decarbonisation of the UK maritime sector? Please provide supporting evidence for your views, including costs and benefits.

Impacts

The inclusion of 50% of emissions from international voyages is expected to be a significant driver for decarbonisation. It will ensure that 100% of emissions are covered on voyages between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), from the combination of the UK ETS and EU ETS. The additional 50% of emissions coverage on other international routes will support the decarbonisation of these routes. Impacts associated with this policy will be analysed as part of the Impact Assessment (IA) to be published alongside the Authority Response to this consultation.

Potential impacts of UK ETS expansion to international maritime voyages

The Impact Assessment accompanying the main Authority Response on the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime sets out the evidence on the expected impacts of domestic expansion. Benefits include greenhouse gas emissions savings and air quality benefits in the maritime sector, whilst costs include costs to maritime operators of investing in abatement technologies, administrative costs to operators of complying with the scheme, and the cost of buying UK ETS allowances. The proposed expansion of the scheme to UK international maritime voyages is expected to deliver similar impacts on greenhouse gas emissions savings and air quality benefits. However, the precise extent of this is uncertain, in part due to interactions between the UK ETS and EU ETS, and interactions between these schemes and the IMO NZF, which will both be subject to review following adoption of the IMO NZF to account for these interactions.

As the expansion to domestic maritime emissions includes all emissions produced in port domestically, regardless of the voyage, the proposed expansion to international maritime voyages would not bring any new maritime operators into scope. In addition, many operators will also be subject to EU ETS and IMO Data Collection System (DCS) requirements. Therefore, additional administrative costs from expansion to international maritime voyages are expected to be minimal. However, operators conducting both domestic and international voyages will see a greater proportion of their emissions covered by the UK ETS, which may increase their overall abatement and allowance purchasing costs.

Early evidence from the EU ETS expansion to maritime shows that there is limited evidence of route changes to avoid ETS coverage, however, there is some evidence of ships making additional ports of call in the UK to avoid paying full coverage on intra-European journeys . By expanding the UK ETS to cover 50% of international voyage emissions, this would remove the incentive for vessel operators to undertake additional ports of call in the UK, therefore reducing the risk of gaming and carbon leakage, though this could result in lower UK port activity.

Other evidence from the same EU report has shown that the additional costs imposed by the EU ETS on the transportation of goods via maritime are expected to be low, however, maritime operators have begun to implement surcharges to cover and pass-through these costs. The extent to which ETS costs are passed through to the final costs of goods is uncertain, but is expected to be minimal based on existing evidence, which is set out in the Impact Assessment for domestic maritime expansion. Further evidence on the potential impact of the expansion of the ETS to domestic maritime is explored in the Impact Assessment. This evidence is broadly expected to also apply for the expansion to international maritime voyages. However, there may be some impacts that are of greater relevance to UK - international maritime voyage expansion, for example, impacts on international trade, and risks of modal shift from maritime to modes of transport not covered by the UK ETS.

Questions

9. Do you agree with our understanding of the impacts of including international voyages in the UK ETS? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

10. Do you think that the proposed expansion to international maritime voyages could lead to any adverse impacts? (Y/N) This could include, but is not limited to, impacts on prices and availability of goods for consumers, impacts on the competitiveness of the UK maritime sector, impacts on supply chains, shift to other transport modes, or trade impacts. Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible.

11. Do you think we need to take any action against gaming, transhipment, or evasion if the UK ETS extends to cover emissions from international maritime voyages? (Y/N) Please explain your response, providing evidence where possible

12. Would changes to the global carbon pricing landscape (e.g. the IMO NZF or EU ETS) affect the impacts of the proposed UK ETS expansion to international maritime voyages? If so, how?

Welsh language impacts

The Welsh language is a strategic priority for the Welsh Government. Its Welsh Language Strategy, Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers, has two overarching targets: to reach a million Welsh speakers and to double the percentage of us that use Welsh every day by 2050.

The strategy is delivered across Welsh Government, spanning various policy areas such as housing, the economy, agriculture and education. As such, it is important that we assess the potential effects of proposed policy solutions on the Welsh language and the delivery of our Welsh Language Strategy. We would like your views on how any proposed changes in relation to expanding the scope of the ETS to include international maritime voyages could support our efforts to increase the number of people who speak and use Welsh, avoid any negative impacts, and ensure that we support the delivery of the Welsh Language Strategy.

Question

13. What, in your opinion, would be the likely effects of increasing the scope of the UK ETS to include international maritime voyages on the Welsh language? We are particularly interested in any likely effects on opportunities to use the Welsh language and on not treating the Welsh language less favourably than English.

a. Do you think that there are opportunities to promote any positive effects?

b. Do you think that there are opportunities to mitigate any adverse effects?

14. In your opinion, could increasing the scope of the UK ETS to include international maritime voyages be formulated or changed so as to:

a. have positive effects or more positive effects on using the Welsh language and on not treating the Welsh language less favourably than English; or

b. mitigate any negative effects on using the Welsh language and on not treating the Welsh language less favourably than English?

Next steps

While the country earns medium ratings for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy, and energy use, its climate policy performance remains low, experts say.

The low climate policy rating is driven by Greece’s deep dependence on fossil gas, including LNG imports, new regasification units, and a high share of gas in electricity generation. The government’s approval of new offshore oil and gas concessions and its October 2025 refusal to endorse the International Maritime Organization’s net-zero strategy have further contributed to the poor assessment. These actions place Greece at odds with the European Union’s climate stance.

Despite reductions in coal use, with lignite accounting for just 5.7% of power generation in 2024 and a phase-out planned by 2026, the increased reliance on gas has offset some of these gains. Experts note that the absence of a gas phase-out plan and plans for new gas plants undermine Greece’s ability to meet EU climate targets and its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP).

Renewable energy deployment, however, is a bright spot. Renewables now supply over half of Greece’s electricity, supported by higher NECP targets. Incentives for electric vehicles, including free parking and the introduction of electric buses in Athens, also receive positive marks. Subsidized building renovations, although limited in scale, further reflect progress in certain sectors.

Experts highlight significant gaps in transport, tourism, and industry. Road transport emissions are projected to rise, rail network expansion remains slow following the 2023 deadly train accident, and wildfire protection measures are insufficient. The devastating 2025 wildfire season released millions of tons of CO₂ while destroying critical carbon sinks.

Greece’s tentative support for a 90% EU emissions reduction target, conditional on economic feasibility, shows some alignment with international efforts, including participation in the Global Methane Pledge and the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East Climate Initiative.

Perhaps reflecting historical sensitivities on nuclear power, those approaching ABB to explore the options invariably seek non-disclosure agreements, says Virtasalo.
The agreement builds on the terms of a 2024 MoU between the two companies which targets developing SMR technology to support Sweden’s clean energy requirements.
The legal position on nuclear maritime was the subject of a separate article from ABB6 earlier this year, although shipping’s global regulatory landscape on emission reduction remains uncertain.
There is therefore plenty of distance left to cover in the nuclear maritime marathon, he acknowledges.","There are growing indications that shipping can add nuclear propulsion to its options for achieving net zero emissions. Recently technologists, national governments and maritime regulators have increasingly highlighted its fast-emerging potential.

Nuclear-powered ships have an extensive history in naval and icebreaker applications. However, it has been the advent of 4th generation Small Modular Reactors (SMR) which has opened the case for the use of nuclear technology also in commercial shipping. Class societies Lloyd’s Register1, ABS2 and RINA3 have already voiced their support for the nuclear option. Previous ABB articles4 have also highlighted ship concept projects in the public domain. Joining the pack, in September, Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) launched an SMR-powered LNG carrier5 concept, in work with ABS and the Liberia flag. According to the developers, its 100 MWt molten salt reactor would power a ship without refueling through-life.

Intense work has been going on behind the scenes through 2025 to ensure that nuclear propulsion can become a realistic option for commercial shipping

In one indication of market sentiment, nuclear propulsion featured as a headline topic at several London International Shipping Week events in September, and was a frequent talking point for financiers, owners, consultants and insurers at other fuel-focused gatherings.

A quieter revolution

Intense work has also been going on behind the scenes through 2025 to ensure that nuclear propulsion can become a realistic option for commercial shipping, says Markus Virtasalo, Solution Manager, Electric Solutions, ABB’s Marine & Ports division.

Virtasalo is working closely with Samuli Hänninen, Segment Manager, Icebreaking ships, and others on harnessing ABB’s expertise in power distribution, control, automation and system integration to convert nuclear reactors’ thermal energy to electricity and propulsion.

Perhaps reflecting historical sensitivities on nuclear power, those approaching ABB to explore the options invariably seek non-disclosure agreements, says Virtasalo. However, he adds: “Interest is coming from every angle – from owners, class, yards, financiers and others. We have been empowered to make an early start on nuclear ship system and propulsion design, which puts us in a strong position to accommodate any surprises for what will be a marathon – not a sprint.”

Patience will be critical because design schedules are linked to SMR developers' roadmaps for developing reactors of various sizes and types, he explains. Concept design work for nuclear-powered ships also involves collaboration with more stakeholders and more documentation than is typically required for conventional vessels without nuclear systems.

“But since the prize is a reliable source of ship power that generates zero emissions even at high vessel speeds, independent of any external decarbonization device or fuel supply chain issue, this is certainly a marathon worth running. It should also be noted that 4th generation nuclear is not only a decarbonization solution, but irrespective of that, it also opens the door to new advanced merchant ship designs with performance that has been previously unachievable.”

Decisive collaboration

In September, ABB signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swedish nuclear energy company Blykalla to support and accelerate the deployment of small modular lead-cooled reactors to the maritime industry. The agreement builds on the terms of a 2024 MoU between the two companies which targets developing SMR technology to support Sweden’s clean energy requirements.

Blykalla’s Swedish Advanced Lead Reactor (SEALER) is a highly compact, passively safe reactor with inherent safety features ensuring stability even without external control. SEALER is also one of three reactors identified in the Nuclear Propulsion for Merchant Ships I (NuProShip I) project, which aims to adapt a 4th generation SMR to the requirements of maritime vessels – in particular, larger ships.

Working with ABB’s Marine and Ports division will offer Blykalla “a unique opportunity to lead the way in maritime nuclear propulsion – a solution uniquely positioned to meet the sector’s demand for clean energy”, said Jacob Stedman, CEO at Blykalla, at the time of the MoU. “Realizing this vision will require an ecosystem of committed partners, and this collaboration is a critical building block.”

Pre-dating the recent Blykalla announcement, ABB’s work on maritime nuclear power has already included concepts for several different vessel types.

We are looking at everything from icebreakers, containerships and tankers, LNG carriers and yachts – and more.

“We are maturing our thinking, while working with other stakeholders,” says Virtasalo. “The work itself is confidential, but as a general example, we are considering high-power electric propulsion, up to and beyond the limits conventional combustion engines place on propulsion power for ultra-large containerships. Our thinking includes one or two SMRs per ship, depending on the desired output.”

Internal work involves clarifying the upper limits and discussing the implications for control technology and automation, says Virtasalo.

Nuclear intervention

Stamina for the long game will also be needed to align with the timeline of regulators as they reframe maritime legislation to accommodate nuclear-powered ship propulsion.

The legal position on nuclear maritime was the subject of a separate article from ABB6 earlier this year, although shipping’s global regulatory landscape on emission reduction remains uncertain. The long-awaited decision on the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s Net-Zero Framework has been postponed by one year, leaving questions open about next steps. The proposed measure would have required shipping to pay for its emissions at a global scale, while at the same time incentivising alternative fuels via the proposed Net-Zero Fund.

In the absence of a clear global framework, there are ongoing doubts about the readiness and availability of biofuels, methanol, ammonia, batteries and fuel cells to achieve net-zero goals by replacing heavy fuel oil (HFO) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as marine fuels.

In June 2025, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC110) agreed to begin updating legacy regulations governing nuclear-powered ships, tasking the Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC) to start work on a framework to bring nuclear propulsion into the mix to achieve net-zero emissions by around 2050.

In July, the IMO gave NGO status to the Nuclear Energy Maritime Organization (NEMO), whose members include shipowners, shipyards, classification societies, insurers, legal companies and port authorities. ABB is a member of the NEMO ‘task force’ which has been invited to develop formal proposals to bring to IMO for consideration, which Hänninen once again puts in the context of the ‘marathon’ analogy.

Patience will be critical because design schedules are linked to SMR developers' roadmaps for developing reactors of various sizes and types.

Reviewing rules written for 3rd generation Pressurized Water Reactor technology and evaluating which parts to keep, which to update and which will need to be reinvented for 4th generation SMR technology will take time. Pilot projects may need to anticipate overarching global regulation, so that pioneering ship owners can make the running in dedicated ‘green corridors’ that work within bilateral agreements.

Working with nuclear

""If ABB’s knowledge and experience of working with maritime regulations will be key to the success of the ABB-Blykalla partnership, so will the broad scope of its expertise in maritime technology,"" says Samuli Hänninen.

“They are the reactor specialists, while we offer expertise in naval architecture and marine engineering, and insights into what our customers are seeking, to bring the kind of certainty Blykalla can build on to accelerate its development work in this application.”

“From a naval architect’s perspective, interfacing a nuclear reactor with versatile ‘steam-electric’ power plant and integrating it with electric motor driven shaft lines or Azipod® propulsion involves familiar thought processes, and practical knowledge of the flexibility of steam-electric power as a suitable solution across diverse vessel types”, Hänninen points out. “Currently, it is possible to work on generic system solutions, while reactor-specific interfaces can be handled later.”

As well as zero emission power, SMRs will enable other innovations in ship design: the reactor could run the ship without refueling and carrying any additional fuel on board, freeing up space for more cargo, for example, or support faster speeds and so disrupt the market with new transport logistics, Hänninen says.

Pioneering ship owners may make the running in dedicated ‘green corridors’ that work within bilateral agreements.

“We have a clear view on the way steam plant will work, but the interface with the reactor is a key area of focus for our collaboration,” adds Virtasalo. “Of course, we are looking together at issues relating to SMR weights and dimensions, dynamic tolerances, the shielding needed and how installation would integrate into normal shipbuilding practice.”

Detailed work will also include developing the economic case for any new controls that will be needed to ‘marinize’ the SMR. It is a legacy of earlier developments in nuclear ship propulsion that key marine tests remain rooted in analog circuitry and, while there is no technical reason to impede digitalization, Virtasalo explains, this economic case has also yet to be investigated.

There is therefore plenty of distance left to cover in the nuclear maritime marathon, he acknowledges. However, with Blykalla foreseeing its first SMR “reaching criticality” by the early 2030s, the ambitions are also clear.

“We have moved on from the general discussions with class and regulators on the potential of nuclear – to guidelines from class, and working with owners on several ship concept cases, working with different designers, shipyards and other stakeholders,” comments Hänninen. “We are looking at everything from icebreakers, containerships and tankers, LNG carriers and yachts – and more.”

Greek tug supply vessel Aigaion Pelagos’ crew and seafarers on a Bangladesh Coast Guard tugboat and a Japanese Coast Guard vessel were commended for their actions responding to maritime fires.

Captain Flouris Dimitrios and the crew of Aigaion Pelagos were awarded a certificate of commendation for their quick response and salvage of tanker Sounion which was struck by three uncrewed aerial devices and lost engine power in the Red Sea in an August 2024 Houthi attack.

The 2006-built tanker was sailing under the Greek flag and carrying about 150,000 tonnes of heavy crude oil and nearly 3,000 tonnes of bunkers when it was repeatedly hit in Houthi attacks on 21 August 2024. Crew on Sounion were rescued, but the tanker was left burning and drifting for weeks.

Aigaion Pelagos carried out an extensive salvage operation, boarding the abandoned vessel in extreme heat and hazardous conditions, extinguishing the fires and ensuring the cargo was stable.

IMO said the actions of the Aigaion Pelagos captain and crew were ’crucial in preventing an environmental disaster’.

At the time of the incident, the EU naval command in the region said ""The salvage operation of [Sounion] is essential in order to avert a potential environmental disaster in the region. To achieve this, several public and private actors are working together. EUNAVFOR Aspides assets have been actively involved in this complex endeavour, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation.""

The US-based, non-profit Arab Gulf States Institute (AGSI) labelled Houthis as ’ecocriminals’ based on their tactics of attacking, burning and sinking commercial vessels. In a March 2025 analysis, the AGSI said ""The Houthi assaults on shipping traffic are deliberate acts of marine pollution, weaponising oil tankers and bulk carriers to advance their political and military agenda.""

The report cited numerous examples of Houthi attacks that have endangered what the group described as the fragile but abundant ecosystem of the Red Sea.

""Home to about 1,200 fish species and over 350 types of coral, the region’s coral reefs are one of the world’s richest marine ecosystems and most resilient environments to climate change. Additionally, the Red Sea’s high marine biodiversity generates multimillion-dollar revenue streams for the tourism and fishing industries of littoral countries,"" the AGSI said.

The AGSI looked at the Houthi attacks on Greek oil tanker Sounion, which burned for more than four weeks before the Houthis allowed EU naval operation Aspides to launch a salvage operation to tow the vessel to safe waters.

Secretary-General of the IMO, Mr Arsenio Dominguez,

Excellencies,

Distinguished Delegates,

Navigating a Shared Maritime Future

1. Our oceans are the lifeline of international trade. They connect nations, and drive economic opportunities and development. With global trade rising by an estimated US$300 billion within just the first half of this year, the importance of maritime transport will remain as the key enabler of our economies in the years ahead.

2. Yet, our maritime future faces strong currents. Shifting geopolitical dynamics, emerging threats of climate change and the relentless advancement of technology will disrupt maritime trade.

3. To overcome these challenges, Singapore will continue to stand behind the leadership of the IMO and collaborate with all IMO Member States via three key approaches.

4. First, we must uphold the centrality of the IMO in promoting safe, secure and sustainable international shipping. In our increasingly fragmented global environment, we must defend the multilateral, rules-based order and work with one another to further the goals and objectives of the IMO.

5. Second, we need to embrace new technologies that enhance efficiency and future-proof our industry against emerging risks. Technologies such as smart shipping, autonomous vessels, sustainable technologies and artificial intelligence will transform maritime operations. The IMO’s leadership will be pivotal in ensuring these advancements are adopted responsibly – such as by strengthening cybersecurity, governance, upskilling of the workforce and promoting equitable access to technology. The IMO’s plan to adopt a Strategy on Maritime Digitalisation by 2027 is an example of how the Organization ensures that it stays relevant in the face of rapid technological advancements. Singapore will also continue to partner Member States to harness innovation to achieve the IMO’s goal of reducing maritime emissions, and to build a resilient and sustainable maritime industry.

6. Third, the transition to a more efficient and sustainable maritime future must be inclusive. Issues such as digitalisation, decarbonisation, workforce reskilling and supply chain resilience cannot be addressed by a single State alone. We need to work closely to forge partnerships that create economies of scale and promote the adoption of common standards, for the benefit of all. This includes the IMO Net Zero Framework, for which we hope that all Member States can work closely to achieve consensus expeditiously. Singapore remains committed to providing capacity building and training opportunities for fellow IMO Member States, to develop the next generation of the maritime workforce. I am happy to share that the Singapore – IMO Third Country Training Programme (TCTP) has trained more than 2400 maritime professionals from over 100 States to date.

7. To conclude, Singapore remains steadfast in our commitment to work with the IMO and fellow Member States to secure the future of maritime. Collaboration has always been the cornerstone of our shared success. Singapore will continue to contribute actively and effectively to IMO’s work to strengthen the resilience and efficiency of global shipping. Together, we can chart a course towards a maritime future that is safe, secure, sustainable and inclusive, bringing prosperity to all.",http://www.mot.gov.sg/MOT/assets/images/MOT_Logo_200x200.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 09:56:56.413499

Evidence supporting transitional pathways must be presented to IMO early enough to influence and shape a global solution,” said Wilkins.
“Validating the transitional pathways with real-world data and analysis should provide regulators with the confidence to incorporate these pathways into the global framework and provide the certainty and confidence in the regulatory process that the industry requires.”","INTERTANKO’s Deputy Director, Environment Emma Scheiris said: “This decision is a testament to the Members’ continued commitment and alignment on driving decarbonisation forward, notwithstanding the different pathways used to achieve their emission reduction goals.”

Managing Director, Tim Wilkins (pictured) added: “INTERTANKO has been consistent in its approach to achieving a global solution through the IMO to meet the 2023 IMO GHG reduction targets, while respecting the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle. The Association has also been clear that to achieve these targets, the full spectrum of transitional pathways must be supported by the regulatory framework, ranging from energy-saving devices and wind-assisted propulsion to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuels, and net-zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.”

Members voiced their support for INTERTANKO to continue its active role in contributing to the IMO’s draft guidelines and working collaboratively with all stakeholders to validate the transitional pathways. The validity of these pathways has already been assessed by many INTERTANKO Member companies, with evidence emerging that they can form the basis for meeting the reduction targets beyond 2040 and up to 2050. The consolidated data and information support the environmental and business case for using transitional pathways to meet the IMO’s GHG reduction targets. This should form the basis of discussions on the current trajectories and the agreement of a simple and practical legislative framework.

It is important now to gather evidence on the various measures available to reduce GHG emissions from ships. INTERTANKO will form a working group of Member companies to validate these transitional pathways with practical, real-world experience. Recognising that any information gathered must be supplemented with data on the use and supply of certain measures from outside the Association’s membership, the group has been tasked to collaborate with experts and interested parties.

“Success hinges on timing. Evidence supporting transitional pathways must be presented to IMO early enough to influence and shape a global solution,” said Wilkins. “Validating the transitional pathways with real-world data and analysis should provide regulators with the confidence to incorporate these pathways into the global framework and provide the certainty and confidence in the regulatory process that the industry requires.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/677d25916da11d07add7c910/677e42da317bf233c28d75a0/69258296680cec72db87dbba/1764066019426/INTERTANKO+MD+Tim+Wilkins.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-25 05:56:08.090662

Referring to Bangladesh's candidacy for the IMO Council for the 2026-27 term, the Shipping Adviser called on representatives of 175 member countries to vote in favor of Bangladesh.

He highlighted Bangladesh's consistent achievements in ship recycling, shipbuilding, and various maritime trade sectors, as well as the recognition of world-class maritime training.

He also mentioned that Bangladesh has already initiated the provision of ten annual scholarships for seafarers from island nations and least developed countries to enhance their skills and promote cooperation.

The adviser further stated that if re-elected to the IMO Council, Bangladesh will work to ensure fair access to technology and financing for developing maritime nations, promote professional training and capacity building in the seafarer and maritime sectors.

It would also support climate-resilient, low-carbon shipping, and lead the development of an inclusive IMO where all member states, large and small, have equal opportunities, he added.

Throughout the session, through various programs, discussions, and networking events, Bangladesh showcased its candidacy and positive role in global maritime affairs.

During the session, the Shipping Adviser held separate bilateral meetings with Pakistan's Minister of Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar and Belize's Minister of Public Utilities, Energy and LogisticsMaritime Affairs, Michelle Chebat.

In the meeting with Pakistan, discussions focused on expanding maritime trade between Chattogram and Karachi ports, enhancing cooperation between Bangladesh Shipping Corporation and Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, among other key issues.

The Adviser invited Pakistan's Maritime Minister to visit Bangladesh, and in turn received an invitation to visit Pakistan. Both sides emphasized strengthening cooperation in the maritime sector.

In the meeting with Belize, detailed discussions were held on ship recycling, maritime trade, and human resource development.

The Adviser highlighted opportunities for marine cadets from Caribbean and small island states to receive open scholarships at Chattogram Marine Academy. Belize's Minister expressed gratitude for this opportunity and interest in future cooperation.

Speaking at Maritime World, a conference held at the Marriott Hotel, in St Julian’s, he described the IMO’s recent move as making him feel unsettled.

“I have to admit that what happened a few weeks ago at the IMO left me a little disconcerted,” he told a packed conference room. “I hope we don’t waste a year when it comes to the Net-Zero Framework.”

The minister was a keynote speaker at the event, which brought together major players from the global maritime industry to discuss the sector’s future, including decarbonisation efforts.

Bonett called on attendees to adopt a global mindset when tackling maritime emissions and warned against a fragmented approach.

“Regional and protective measures may look good in the short term but, ultimately, could damage world trade in the future,” he said. “Imagine a world where we could have six or seven or 10 different emission trading schemes around the world. That would be a disaster.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is a proposed regulatory package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its 2023 GHG Strategy. It includes two major instruments: a global fuel standard and a worldwide GHG emissions pricing mechanism.

The framework was first approved during the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session in April. However, during the most recent extraordinary session of the MEPC in October, progress stalled. The meeting ended with an agreement to adjourn discussions until October 2026.

“If we really want to decarbonise, we have to commit ourselves as an industry and governments and policymakers to make sure we deliver on our decarbonisation promise,” Bonett said.

Prime Minister Robert Abela also addressed the conference via video message. He underlined Malta’s maritime heritage and highlighted the island’s prominence as a shipping hub.

“Today, Malta is the leading flag registry in Europe and the number one yachting registry in the world,” he said.

By the end of the first quarter of 2025, over 10,000 vessels were registered under the Maltese flag, placing Malta sixth globally.

Environment Minister Miriam Dalli, who also spoke at the event, stressed that international collaboration is essential.

Logistics is the foundation of many industries, and its decarbonization is essential for achieving carbon neutrality across society. However, shipping is considered a hard-to-abate sector, with significant technical and institutional challenges in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In November 2023, the NYK Group announced the NDS, setting ambitious targets: a 45% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (compared to FY2021), and net-zero emissions for Scope 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. We are steadily moving forward with initiatives designed to achieve these goals.

Key Highlights of Progress Report 2025

・Accelerated improvement in the accuracy and scope of Scope 3 emissions* accounting

・Enhanced technical verification for the use of biofuels

・Initiation of pilot procurement of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits**

・Ongoing advocacy activity*** for the establishment of fair and impartial international rules

・Demonstrating leadership in developing international standards for GHG emission intensity of transportation****

Once a week, bunker intelligence platform ENGINE will publish a snapshot of LNG bunker prices in the world’s two biggest bunkering hubs. The following is the latest snapshot:

Rotterdam’s LNG bunker price has slipped as premiums declined, while Singapore’s has climbed, widening its price premium over Rotterdam.

Weekly changes in LNG bunker prices:

Rotterdam down by $18/mt to $666/mt

Singapore up by $18/mt at $692/mt

Rotterdam

Rotterdam’s LNG bunker price has dropped by $18/mt over the past week to $666/mt, largely because LNG bunker premiums fell 9%, slipping from about $131/mt to $120/mt.

The front-month Dutch TTF Natural Gas contract, a key European benchmark, also dipped by 1%, adding to the downward pressure.

“The US-brokered peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is still easing concerns of tightness in the market. Russia still contributes about 10% of the European Union’s gas needs. This weighed on sentiment in the European gas market,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ Bank.

“Reports of peace talks between Russia and the US weighed on (European LNG) prices,” analysts at ING Bank noted.

“TTF prices continued their downward trend… amid the continued ramp-up of LNG supplies, primarily from the United States,” Greg Molnár, gas analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA), added.

Singapore

Singapore’s LNG bunker price has climbed sharply over the past week, rising by $18/mt to $692/mt. This pushes the port’s previous $10/mt premium over Rotterdam to a wider $26/mt.

Prices in Singapore generally track the NYMEX Japan/Korea Marker (JKM), whose front-month contract increased by $0.34/MMBtu to $11.47/MMBtu ($596/mt).

“North Asia LNG prices in the spot market jumped to a two-month high, aided by a surge in spot freight rates,” according to ANZ Bank’s Daniel Hynes.

After a September dip, LNG sales rebounded by 25% in October in Singapore, with average daily volumes rising by roughly 400 mt to 2,000 mt. Total LNG sales from January to October reached nearly 462,000 mt, up from 388,000 mt in the same period last year.

Benny Hilstroem, Vice President of Market Development at Swiss marine power company WinGD, in an article published on Thursday (20 November), highlighted that LNG remains a strong, credible transition pathway, especially as the industry navigates uncertainty around global carbon pricing and clean-fuel incentives:

With or without the IMO Net Zero Framework, LNG remains a viable transition pathway towards decarbonisation and, with X-DF technology, ultra-low air pollution.

Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fuelled and X-DF-M methanol-fuelled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030—an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time we have amassed more than 8 million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG benefits

Take methane slip as an example. In less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimising the X-DF platform mean operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.

Stena Line CEO Niclas Mårtensson, said: “The naming of Stena Futura is a proud moment for Stena Line and Belfast Harbour.","Driving maritime transformation towards IMO 2050 and the adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework (NZF) demands a multifaceted approach: Requiring a strong, unified leadership to overcome political fragmentation, pragmatic and incremental solutions, and robust collaboration across the industry, agreed panellists at a recent conference.

Constantinos Capetanakis, IBIA Chair and Bunker Director at Star Bulk, was moderating ‘Session one: Leadership Discussion – Driving Maritime Transformation’ at the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 in Hong Kong on Tuesday (18 November) when the following panellists share their observations:

Caroline Yang, CEO, Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd, Past Chair, SSA; Former Vice Chair, ICS

Yang underscored the urgent need for strong, unified leadership in the global maritime sector.

She highlighted the current paradox of leadership, where some regions experience a breakdown of authority while others contend with overly strong, singular leaders – as seen in the failure by the MEPC extraordinary session in October 2025 to approve the IMO NZF.

“Today, we need strong, unified leadership—often a team rather than a single person,” she highlighted.

“The global maritime sector must come together, reflect on issues raised about the net-zero framework, and use platforms like the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) to find solutions.

“While democracy is valued, a strong leader with a heart for their country is crucial for implementing long-term plans, as democracy and decarbonisation can sometimes be at odds.”

For the maritime industry, this translates into a demand for a robust team of leaders to navigate the complexities of decarbonisation.

Yang emphasised that the industry’s consensus on a net-zero framework, despite its imperfections, was a crucial step towards establishing a single set of global rules, preferable to fragmentation.

“The industry supported the net-zero framework because one set of global rules is preferable to fragmentation,” Yang explained.

“While not perfect, it was the best option. The way adoption was blocked through calculated, ‘brute force’ tactics was shocking.

“However, the delay provides 12 months to address valid points raised, such as fund management concerns. Like-minded industry and government players must regroup, rethink, and redress these issues.”

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD)

Professor Loo, meanwhile, noted the maritime sector can navigate the uncertainties and steer towards a sustainable future by bridging scientific rigor with commercial realities, fostering innovative financing, and embracing data-driven decisions.

She gave a preview on the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) which secured total commitments of up to USD 35 million; FEET is the world’s first vessel retrofit fund to use a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, directly linking repayments to verified fuel and regulatory savings.

“The banks we work with understand the challenge, but risks remain due to uncertainty. Our ‘pay-as-you-save’ model pegs loan repayments to actual bunker fuel savings, helping spread risk and reward.

“The energy transition is inherently risky; the key is to use ideas like blended finance and diversified portfolios to collectively minimise and share risk.”

Moving forward, Professor Loo advocated for an incremental approach to decarbonisation, likening it to “eating an elephant, one bite at a time”.

“Incremental progress is vital. Energy efficiency is crucial for both current and future marine fuels,” she stated.

“Carbon capture is an important retrofit option for the two-thirds of the current fleet that will likely never use future fuels and would otherwise become stranded assets. It’s akin to installing a chemical factory on a ship, but it offers an option for vessels on unscheduled routes because we believe CO2 can be offloaded in a manner not too different from “deslopping”.

“There won’t be a single solution; choices depend on vessel, age, and routes.”

The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, proposed a global carbon tax on the shipping industry.
Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming.
It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act.

Last month, the United Nations attempted to pass the first ever global carbon tax. It won’t be the last.

This would have increased the cost of energy, food, and fuel around the world. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, proposed a global carbon tax on the shipping industry. This agency would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable nations.” I wonder if this is how the U.N. seeks to make up for lost USAID revenue.

This tax is especially egregious because it was a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, would have increased global shipping costs by over ten percent.

It’s also yet another example of liberal Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the climate policies of other countries and enrich themselves in the process.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act. Sin or crime?

As a vote over this global carbon tax approached last month, President Trump himself took to Truth Social, calling the proposal a ""global green new scam tax on shipping."" His administration released a statement, warning that the U.S. was considering additional tariffs, visa restrictions, additional port fees, and sanctions on officials from countries that voted for this climate tax. They also encouraged other nations to abandon the deal.

The campaign succeeded. Last month, at the tail end of negotiations, Saudi Arabia abruptly called for a vote to adjourn the IMO meeting for one year without making a decision on the net-zero framework. The proposed delay was voted on immediately and passed with 57 countries in favor and 49 against. (Twenty-one countries abstained from the vote.)

Em Fenton, a senior director at Opportunity Green, a U.K.-based radical environmentalist group said ""The outcome in October is a devastating blow for climate multilateralism."" Good.

I assume that the General Conference and ADCOM—who tend to side with the United Nations on global warming/climate change alarmism—are similarly disappointed.

Good.

While the global shipping industry faces steep challenges in cutting emissions, Patrick Kettschau, managing director of Everllence China, points to China's integrated supply chain — from shipyards to alternative fuel production — as a critical solution.

""While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,"" he said.

""This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.""

As the world's largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

""These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,"" he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China's energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create ""near-zero carbon ""shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year's United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

""With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,"" he said.

""We are committed to helping achieve the nation's dual carbon goals and accelerate the global shipping industry's green transition, contributing lasting momentum to the world's shift toward a low-carbon energy and industrial system.""",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202511/25/692508a3a310d68600f2e436.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 20:57:12.692203

Turbochargers are constantly evolving. The latest-generation TCRs are made from more advanced materials that enable them to be more efficient and reliable, while also being more powerful and lighter. With lower cost of running in mind, the new materials mean less maintenance and a longer working life.

As Everllence’s ETB model illustrates, turbochargers are specifically designed to match every engine, in this case for EcoEGR applications in which the blower runs continuously in Tier III and Tier II Eco mode. Introduced some six years ago, EcoEGR has since been widely deployed in marine engines in the interests of lower emissions.

The ETB range was designed from the outset to marry up with the EGR system, a breakthrough in engine tuning. Under EGR, fuel consumption and NOx emissions are reduced in large turbocharged diesel engines so that the performance of the engine and blower are re-optimised. Typically, the blower runs continuously in both Tier III and Tier II Eco mode. Real-world tests show a 5% improvement in charging efficiency, a 10% increase in specific airflow and, especially impressive, a 25% gain in charging pressure.

“The TCF blower reduces emissions”

These increases in performance are achieved in a much more compact design than previous turbocharger series. Weight is down by roughly 40% and overall size by 30%.

Radial blower

Everllence’s TCF radial blower, optimised for maximum flow, is designed to function at part load. As tests have proved, a TCF retrofit and engine modification package improved fuel consumption in the relevant operating range by 4.5%. The TCF blower also reduces emissions to help meet regulations such as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI). The modular construction of the TCF makes for easy installation. In two-stage applications the TCF series works as the low-pressure turbocharger, a configuration that helps reduce the size or number of blowers required in ways that cut costs.

And as demand for retrofits grows, the TCFs are designed for quick and easy replacement because of the modular construction and standard connection dimensions. The range is also known for easy maintenance and extended periods between overhauls.

Heritage

Everllence’s latest designs build on a long heritage. Its first turbochargers were installed some 80 years ago and quickly built up a loyal following for their reliability. Today, they run on 65,000 engines in what amounts to a giant real-world laboratory that underpins a constant improvement.

The TCP range, for instance, is a product of that mindset, enabling output increases of about 20% that operators can exploit in their own way. Everllence explained: “That translates to increased power at a similar cost, or a smaller engine, or fewer cylinders for the same output.”

The numbers tell the story. Current one-stage blowers typically deliver pressure ratios of well above 5.0, while the TCPs achieve stable operating points as high as 6.7. These figures result from a complete reworking of the aerodynamic stages on the compressor and turbine sides. In other numbers, overall efficiency levels are improved by about 70%, dynamic behaviour in the form of the rotor moment of inertia is down by 25%, and specific engine costs by 20%. Maximum permissible temperature is 650-750C. And in the interests of ease of installation, the TCPs are plug-and-play because the flange connections are the same as existing turbochargers. The range is suitable for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol, as well as conventional fuels.

Blowers are some of the hardest-working items in the engineroom and even the most robust turbochargers can suffer failures. Everllence offers its PrimeServ 24/7 year-round troubleshooting service. Technicians are always available to deal with questions from the engineroom and get the blowers back up and working. In the worst case, OEM spare parts are only 24-hours away. Everllence prides itself on rapid deliveries and that is useful when downtime costs US$22,000 a day and often much more. With strategically placed hubs around the world, PrimeServ’s technicians can adjust on the spot if a ship misses a routine maintenance stop because of a changed route.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/TCF_turbocharger_on_left_MAN_ESwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-24 16:56:45.420514

The event highlighted how the IMO’s adoption of the Net Zero Framework, originally scheduled, has been postponed once again, leaving the private and commercial sectors without the regulatory push needed for fleet decarbonization.

The delay, announced on October 17 following a direct intervention by then-President Trump, has raised questions about what went wrong, what lessons can be learned, and how the superyacht industry can proactively prepare for an uncertain regulatory landscape.

The panel was moderated by Lorenzo Pollicardo, Technical and Environmental Director at SYBAss, with experts including Julian Amith (Cayman Island Shipping Registry), Simone Brucker (Sanlorenzo R&D), Engel Jan De Boer (Lloyd Register), and Robert Van Tol (Water Revolution Foundation).

Ocean Assist: A New Tool for the Industry

At the center of the discussion was the Ocean Assist program, promoted by the Water Revolution Foundation, aimed at converting voluntary industry actions into certified, measurable investments for ocean conservation. Vienna Eleuteri, Vice President of the Foundation, explained that Ocean Assist turns donations and offsets into units generated by tangible projects, including blue carbon restoration, marine biodiversity recovery, and coastal community regeneration. Transparency is ensured through independent verification according to ISO 14064 part 3 standards, avoiding greenwashing and guaranteeing measurable outcomes.

Georgina Van Henniet, Head of Sustainability at Burgess, emphasized the practical value of the program for daily fleet operations: beyond reducing environmental impact, it prepares crews and operators for future regulatory requirements, translating emission reductions into certified, actionable results.

Challenges and Opportunities: From Regulation to Daily Practice

A major topic was the relationship between international regulation and voluntary industry initiatives. Fiorenzo Spadoni (RINA) highlighted how ISO certification provides credibility and rigor, distinguishing solid programs from marketing claims. The panel also discussed technological and operational limitations, such as using alternative fuels like methanol in various vessel constructions and the need for crew training, emphasizing that innovations must be implemented safely and with the right infrastructure.

Georgina Van Henniet noted that practical adoption is still in its early stages: the global fleet comprises around 6,000 yachts over 30 meters, with 170 new units delivered annually. Managing emissions requires a gradual but systemic approach, starting with measurable portions of the fleet and assets while anticipating future IMO regulations.

Robert Van Tol compared fiscal tools with offset programs like Ocean Assist, showing how voluntary participation today can prepare owners and operators for stricter future regulations, optimizing both cost and impact.

Current Status and Outlook

The delay in adopting the Net Zero Framework represents a strategic opportunity for the superyacht industry: the unregulated fleet can develop and implement sustainable practices in advance, potentially influencing future IMO guidelines for small ships and yachts. The forum’s key message was clear: immediate action, transparency, and collaboration among operators, foundations, and certification bodies are essential to building a sustainable, future-ready sector.

In conclusion, even in the absence of immediate obligations, the industry has a clear path: adopt tools like Ocean Assist, anticipate regulatory requirements, and create a measurable positive impact on the oceans, turning the challenge of decarbonization into an opportunity for leadership and innovation in the superyacht sector.

At a glance COP 30 in Belém showcased both progress and shortcomings in global climate action.","Framed around the theme of implementation, the conference focused less on setting new aspirations and more on translating ambition into concrete action. However, many observers described it as a “COP of truth,” highlighting the deep divisions and deviations from shared climate goals that became evident.

Critics argue that while COP 30 made strides in funding and measurement, it fell short on mitigation ambition, with UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, saying:

I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide

In any case, At COP30, 195 Parties adopted the Belém Package, approving 29 decisions on topics like just transition, adaptation finance, trade, gender, and technology.

Main take‑aways from COP 30, reflecting both its progress and its persistent tensions, include:

Global mutirão

The main formal decision of COP30 issued a historic call for humanity to unite in a global mutirão (collective efforts) against climate change, marking a new chapter for the climate regime.

As we leave Belém, this moment must not be remembered as the end of a conference, but as the beginning of a decade of turning the game

… said COP30 President, André Corrêa do Lago, adding that “the spirit we built here does not end with the gavel; it continues in every government meeting, every boardroom and trade union, every classroom, laboratory, forest community, large city, and coastal town.”

Adaptation finance: tripling support by 2035

The approved decisions in the Belém Package include a commitment to triple adaptation finance by 2035, emphasizing the need for developed countries to significantly boost climate finance for developing nations.

Parties also concluded the Baku Adaptation Roadmap (launched during COP 29), which approves and establishes the work for 2026-2028, until the next Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. This initiative supports vulnerable countries by promoting innovative financing and technical aid for National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Measuring adaptation: indicators and monitoring

COP 30 also saw the adoption of 59 global indicators designed to track progress under the Global Goal on Adaptation. These indicators span areas like water, food security, public health, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

In addition, the conference launched a Global Implementation Accelerator aimed at helping countries deliver on their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and their national adaptation plans.

Just transition mechanism

COP 30 established a Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) to facilitate fairness as economies shift to a greener model. The mechanism is intended to provide technical assistance, capacity-building, knowledge sharing, and other support to countries and communities vulnerable to the social and economic risks of decarbonization.

Fossil fuel roadmap: a major controversy

At COP30, many countries pushed for a binding global roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, but strong opposition from major oil-producing nations prevented any mandatory language from being included in the final negotiated text.

In response, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago announced two voluntary roadmaps outside the formal UN process: one outlining a “just, orderly and equitable” transition away from fossil fuels, and another aimed at halting and reversing deforestation. Because these initiatives were launched by the COP Presidency rather than negotiated and adopted by all Parties, they carry political rather than legal weight.

Many observers saw this as a diluted outcome, signaling how deep divisions remain on fossil fuel phase-out.

Tropical forests forever facility

In a major win for forest conservation, COP 30 launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF). This denotes a blended-finance investment fund aimed at channeling public and private finance to reward tropical forest protection.

Institutional and gender equality dimensions

COP 30 reaffirmed the importance of gender-responsive climate action, supporting a strengthened Gender Action Plan to ensure that women and girls are central in adaptation and resilience efforts.

Also, there was a renewed push for institutional cooperation: capacity‑building, technology transfer, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms were reaffirmed as key levers for global climate progress.

Maritime developments at COP 30

Shipping and maritime transport received particular attention at COP 30, especially regarding black carbon, decarbonization, and the role of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

IMO leadership & vision

IMO leadership played a visible role at COP 30. The IMO Secretary-General used the platform to advocate for a green future for shipping, emphasizing the urgency of shifting toward zero-carbon fuels, modern technologies, and comprehensive regulation.

I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization. Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own

… the Sec-Gen highlighted.

At the same time, IMO’s Director of Marine Environment acknowledged a “setback” related to progress on the Net Zero Forum but insisted the IMO would continue pushing forward. He argued that the setback should not derail ambition and that the long-term vision for green shipping remains intact.

Shipping decarbonization ambitions

Various stakeholders, including NGOs and industry actors, called for accelerated action on shipping decarbonization. Their calls included demands for stricter policies, stronger incentives for alternative fuels, and more support for vulnerable countries.

For instance, Danish Shipping announced they will strengthen their climate ambitions, pledging to intensify efforts to reduce emissions, possibly by investing in greener fuels and improving energy efficiency.

Integration into global action

A Task Force on Oceans was unveiled during a high-level ministerial meeting at COP30. Led by Brazil and France, the initiative integrates oceans into a global mechanism that accelerates the adoption of marine solutions in national climate plans.

It also builds on the work of the Blue Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Challenge, which encourages countries to set ocean protection targets when updating their NDCs.

Other significant COP 30 maritime decarbonization milestones include:

Maersk announced plans to operate 41 methanol-enabled vessels by 2027.

Los Angeles–Long Beach–Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor achieved first milestones with 100% electrification in 3 ports, deployment of the first green methanol container ship, and Port of Shanghai bunkering 47,000 tonnes of green methanol.

C40 Cities, supported by the IFC and IAPH, launched a new Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative targeting USD 1 billion in green maritime infrastructure investment within three years, focusing on Global South ports.

Port of Açu (Brazil) and Port of Antwerp-Bruges (Belgium) announced a green shipping corridor between Brazil and Europe.

Marine Biodiversity & Ocean Health Toolkit launched as a practical resource for the maritime value chain, helping shipping reduce biodiversity impacts, improve operational performance, and support a resilient ocean economy.

Climate risk assessment pilot in an African port, with over 30 ports signing the Call to Action to mainstream resilience in business operations. This represents one of the fastest and broadest commitments by the port industry to integrate climate adaptation into core strategies.

Furthermore, nine countries agreed to slash black carbon emissions, a potent short-lived climate pollutant emitted by ships (among other sources).

At a glance

COP 30 in Belém showcased both progress and shortcomings in global climate action. The summit advanced adaptation finance, institutional tools, and tracking systems.

However, it fell short on a binding fossil fuel phase-out and strong mitigation pledges, disappointing many observers and raising questions about sustained momentum.

In the maritime sector, COP 30 enhanced shipping commitments, with the IMO showing active leadership.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior.
“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated.
About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","Following the closing of the COP30 climate summit this weekend, the Clean Arctic Alliance criticised the lack of action on fossil fuels, and failure to harness potential quick victories from cutting black carbon and other short-lived climate forcers.

“COP30 promised so much - it’s disappointing that it delivered so little”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “There was a clear lack of urgency amongst governments, in the face of the climate crisis, with a complete dearth of official COP30 attention to easy wins on short-lived climate forcers - like black carbon.”

“However, with less than a fortnight to go for governments to submit a plan for cutting a plan for cutting black carbon emissions from shipping in the Arctic, International Maritime Organization member states - led by Arctic governments - must now respond to the high-level announcement made by several governments - including Canada - at COP30 on sectoral action to tackle black carbon emissions from commercial and residential energy and transport sources”, added Prior.

“These countries clearly recognise the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic”, said Prior.

“Addressing black carbon offers a unique opportunity to advance climate change mitigation, build climate resilience, improve air quality, safeguard public health, and deliver

sustainable development co-benefits”, said the statement by Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Uganda.

Governments need to urgently act ahead of the December 5th deadline for proposals on polar fuels, ahead of a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13) in February 2026 in London that will set rules on what fuels can be used in the immediate future by shipping in the Arctic.

Momentum towards these polar fuels is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers recently recommended that Nordic governments work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention. Now, during COP30, governments have again recognised the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic.

“As this announcement from COP30 shows, the world is starting to take urgent action on black carbon emissions - we need Arctic governments to take action ahead of the IMO’s December 5th deadline, in order to dramatically reduce black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “By making cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being dramatically affected by climate change, Arctic governments - and other IMO member states - have a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue”.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior. “The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated. The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th - and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states, including Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark/Greenland, on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting. Switching to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — will rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Clean_Arctic_Alliance_COP30.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:19.722393

Clean Seas to tackle ocean plastic

Our oceans underpin global trade and face mounting plastic challenges

Oceans carry around 90% of global trade and provide livelihoods for more than 2 million seafarers worldwide. Yet they face unprecedented pressure, with 14 million tonnes of plastic entering and damaging marine ecosystems every year.

While the maritime sector contributes only a small fraction of this pollution, even isolated cargo losses or poor waste handling on board or quayside can have serious consequences which could be prevented, especially with plastic pellets, films and light packaging. By advancing best practices, innovation, and collaboration across the value chain, the industry can play a pivotal role in reducing plastic leakage and protecting the very waters it relies on.

A pivotal moment for maritime sustainability

MACS builds on the IMO’s established Plastic Marine Litter Action Plan and responds to the growing global sentiment for coordinated, industry-wide action on plastic pollution.

As scrutiny around environmental and community impact intensifies, MACS creates a unified front for maritime players to reduce plastic use, share best practices, and inspire change across adjacent sectors with even larger plastic footprints.

Collective action for measurable impact

MACS builds on SCS’ track record of tackling plastic pollution at its source. Operating in some of the world’s most polluted coastal regions, SCS develops holistic certified recovery projects that not only recover ocean plastic but also deliver fair employment and community impact on the ground.

The Association brings maritime leaders together to tackle two core objectives of ocean plastic recovery at scale and waste reduction across the maritime value chain, with the initial focus for 2026 on three key areas:

Sustainable procurement and material use;

Vessel waste measurement and reduction;

And improved portside waste reception.

These efforts align directly with the IMO’s 2030 Action Plan. It also marks a key milestone in SCS’ mission to recover 100,000,000 kilograms of plastic and improve 200,000 lives by 2030, proving how targeted collaboration can drive systemic change and inspire far-reaching environmental progress.

“Seven Clean Seas has always believed in collective action as the most powerful lever for change,” said Tom Peacock-Nazil, Founder & Chairman of MACS. “With MACS, we’re providing the maritime industry with the tools it needs to make measurable progress against plastic pollution. Not in isolation, but together.”

Driving systemic change through collaboration

Founding members Berge Bulk, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), X-Press Feeders, and Britoil Offshore Services represent a cross-section of the global maritime sector, from bulk carriers and ship management to offshore operations. Their participation reflects a shared commitment to operational excellence, environmental leadership, and data transparency.

“At Berge Bulk, the oceans are at the heart of our business, so we have always felt an obligation to protect them and a responsibility to keep them clean,” said Michael Blanding, Head of Sustainability & Communications. “Our long-standing work with SCS has already delivered tangible results, and through MACS, we’re proud to help lead a united industry response that can achieve change at scale.”

Francis Goh, Chief Operating Officer of X-Press Feeders, added, “As a global shipping company, we recognise the responsibility we have to safeguard the oceans that sustain global trade. Our collaboration with SCS goes back several years and joining MACS is a natural extension of our sustainability journey which goes beyond reducing emissions to also address the waste and plastic challenges facing our shared environment. Together with our peers, we can make practical, lasting improvements across the maritime ecosystem.”

“Our work begins and ends with the sea, and with that comes a responsibility to protect it,” said Florent Kirchhoff, Chief Executive Officer of Britoil Offshore Services. “Through this partnership with MACS, Britoil aims to advance responsible operations through collaboration, reflecting our shared care for the oceans and the ingenuity that drives us to find solutions for a better future.”

Elena Pantazidou, HR Director & Board Member of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, commented, “At Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, we believe that safeguarding our oceans is not just a responsibility but a commitment to future generations. Joining forces as a founding member of the Maritime Association for Clean Seas reflects our dedication to driving sustainable practices across the maritime industry.”

MACS welcomes members who wish to play an active role in shaping a cleaner, more sustainable future for the maritime industry and the oceans that sustain it.

Studies estimate the sector produces around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, putting it on par with a mid-sized industrial economy.
In , the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a revised greenhouse gas strategy that calls for net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, with ambitious checkpoints in 2030 and 2040.

But Zafar believes that, for now, the biggest gains still lie in disciplined engineering and operations onboard today’s tankers.","International shipping, which moves more than four-fifths of world trade, is under growing pressure to clean up its climate footprint. Studies estimate the sector produces around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, putting it on par with a mid-sized industrial economy.

In , the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a revised greenhouse gas strategy that calls for net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, with ambitious checkpoints in 2030 and 2040. For tanker fleets trading to and from ports in Pakistan and the wider region, these policies are no longer distant discussions in conference rooms – they are beginning to influence everyday engineering decisions on board.

Among the engineers dealing with these changes at sea is Marine Chief Engineer Zafar Ali, a Pakistani maritime specialist with more than 15 years’ experience on crude oil, product and chemical tankers, currently sailing with a major international ship management company. From drydock projects in Dubai, China and Bahrain to routine voyages, he has seen how environmental rules now sit alongside safety and cost in every major technical choice.

“A few years ago climate felt like a policy topic far away from the engine room,” Zafar says. “Now every big job on a ship comes with three questions: is it safe, is it economical and what does it do to our emissions?”

The regulatory push covers everything from fuel quality to how ships are maintained. The IMO’s

response 2023 strategy is being translated into detailed measures such as stricter carbon-intensity targets, mandatory energy-efficiency plans and the building blocks of a global carbon-pricing regime for shipping. Older tankers that burn more fuel per tonne-mile face increasing pressure to upgrade or risk higher compliance costs.

In Zafar’s experience, the most visible changes on tankers involve the systems that sit around the main engine. Ballast Water Management rules require ships to install and run approved ballast water treatment systems (BWTS) to stop harmful species moving between ports, while exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) help ships meet sulphur limits and cut local air pollution. But he says the real impact comes from how reliably these systems operate.

On one tanker undergoing scheduled repairs in drydock, his team conducted a full overhaul of the existing ballast water system, replacing the original reagent-type TRO (Total Residual Oxidant) sensors with more reliable direct halogen TRO sensors. This upgrade, along with a simplified control layout, improved the system's integration with the ship's automation system, reducing alarms and downtime during port calls. The clearer procedures and better integration enabled the crew to operate the system more efficiently, achieving stable disinfection performance and predictable compliance. Another project focused on fine-tuning of electronic engine settings and tightening up fuel-performance monitoring, leading to noticeable fuel savings over the following trading year.

For Pakistan, these technical details link directly to national climate ambitions. Research suggests that ships serving Pakistani trade routes emit a substantial volume of greenhouse gases each year, contributing to the country’s broader transport-sector emissions. As Pakistan pursues cleaner transport and coastal environments, vessels calling at Karachi, Port Qasim and Gwadar are expected to demonstrate both environmental compliance and operational reliability.

Zafar’s day-to-day role reflects that mix of priorities. He plans drydock work so that conventional maintenance – hull cleaning, machinery overhaul, safety upgrades – is paired with targeted energy-efficiency measures, such as optimising propeller and hull condition, improving boiler settings or adjusting auxiliary power management. He also emphasises data: simple trend charts of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, he says, often reveal issues before they become expensive problems.

“You can’t treat decarbonisation as a one-off retrofit and tick it off the list,” Zafar says. “The ships, the crew and the shore office all have to treat energy performance as something they manage every day, just like safety.”

Looking ahead, global shipyards are building more dual-fuel vessels capable of running on alternatives such as LNG and methanol, while proposals for a global carbon levy on shipping create additional incentives for low-emission operations. But Zafar believes that, for now, the biggest gains still lie in disciplined engineering and operations onboard today’s tankers.

“New fuels and new designs will arrive in time,” he says. “If we look after the basics – good maintenance, careful energy management and well-trained crews – then when the cleaner technology comes, our ships will be ready to use it responsibly.”",https://www.thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/large/2025-11-24/global-green-rules-reshape-tanker-engineering-says-marine-chief-engineer-zafar-ali-1763983200-9462.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 08:56:08.926351

LNG and biofuel bunker sales at Rotterdam, the world's second-largest marine refueling hub, have been on an upward trend in recent years, with the port authority kickstarting its pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050. The port reported 2.45 million metric tons of marine fuel sales during July-September, of which alternatives to conventional, oil-based fuels accounted for 13.2%, the highest among major bunker ports. Deliveries of biofuels, composed mainly of biodiesel-fuel oil blends, reached 201,319 mt, and fossil LNG amounted to 121,614 mt. ""For the next few years, we will have LNG there together with new green fuels for quite some time,"" Simons said in a recent interview. ""We have set out to increase the volume of biofuels and to come up with bunkering facilities for new fuels, to work on imports and exports and bunkering strategies for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol."" The continued efforts to decarbonize Rotterdam's bunker mix came despite International Maritime Organization member states voting in mid-October to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by a year, Platts reported earlier. The proposed regulation, backed by the Netherlands and nearly all other EU states, was designed to promote the uptake of low-carbon fuels by placing a cost on maritime greenhouse gas emissions from 2028. ""The postponement of the adoption of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework is a major setback,"" Simons said. ""The absence of a global level playing field, long term perspective and limited demand for sustainable transportation make it difficult to scale and remain competitive."" Brussels has extended its Emissions Trading System to cover shipping from 2024, while introducing FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy's greenhouse gas intensity in January, pushing up total refueling expenses for ships in EU-related trades. October's average delivered bunker costs for B30 with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in Rotterdam were $841.70/mt for ships sailing to a non-EU port, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator. Costs for B24 were $728.46/mt in Singapore, the world's largest bunker port, for ships on voyages to an EU port. DEVELOPMENTS AT ROTTERDAM Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks. At the Gate terminal, a new LNG storage tank of 180,000 cu m and additional regasification capacity of 4 bank cubic meters per year is due to be operational by the second half of 2026. Bunker supplier Peninsula will add eight tanks with a total capacity of 80,000 cu m to its biofuel storage and blending facilities in Chane Terminal next January, bringing its total capacity to 110,000 cu m. Rotterdam currently handles 2 million mt/year of methanol and 400,000 mt/year of ammonia, predominantly made from fossil fuels, but those would lay the foundation for the transition to sustainable methanol and ammonia bunkering, according to Simons. The port has been piloting methanol bunkering projects. In April, Trammo completed a ship-to-ship transfer of 800 cu m of ammonia at OCI's terminal in preparation for future ammonia bunkering. In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier. ""We are also preparing for bunkering of liquid hydrogen for short-sea shipping,"" Simons said. ""We are focused on having the infrastructure for new bunker fuels."" However, the executive stressed that the marine energy transition would depend on the supply-demand fundamentals for green fuels, whose prices are higher than conventional fuels due to limited production. ""Real growth in the uptake of sustainable fuels depends on clear, consistent, and global regulation,"" Simons said. ""The Net-Zero Framework provides a crucial step forward — so we hope next year the NZF will be adopted."" SHORESIDE POWER Simons said Rotterdam has 10 berths for ocean-going ships installed with shoreside power charging network and 100 cabinets for inland shipping, with plans for further expansion. Based on EU regulations, container and passenger ships must be connected to charging facilities by 2030 at the main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network, including Rotterdam. The ports, in turn, are required to develop the infrastructure to meet 90% of ship operators' demand. While inland ships can be fully electrified due to limited space for on-board battery systems, large, ocean-going ships could be designed or retrofitted to run on power at berth and turn off their auxiliary engines during ""cold-ironing,"" leading to lower marine fuel use and CO2 emissions as well as less air pollution.

Let’s also consider that approximately 38% of global maritime trade volume is currently dedicated to oil and gas transport (UNCTAD, 2024).","In an exclusive interview with Lukas Leppert, Transport Policy Officer at NABU, and Dr. Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance, we explore the vision behind a newly launched organization designed to bring clarity and alignment to maritime decarbonization pathways.

The organization – MARBEM (Maritime Beyond Methane) – advocates for a ‘beyond methane’ mindset, arguing that this approach will enable the maritime sector to transition toward long-term solutions capable of achieving net-zero emissions. While significant regulatory intervention is still lacking, the experts emphasize that pursuing a methane-free future would help create a resilient, future-proof maritime industry. They also outline their plans to strengthen the integrity of global decarbonization efforts.

SAFETY4SEA: What was the main motivation behind launching Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM), and what gap does it fill in current maritime decarbonization efforts?

The motivation for Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM) is to provide clarity and alignment around maritime decarbonization pathways. The current landscape is dominated by regulatory uncertainty and fragmented policies, enabling pseudo solutions – such as methane-based fuels – to gain market share, without regulators fully accounting for the long-term political, financial, economic, health and social risks. MARBEM fills this gap by providing independent, evidence-based analyses and expert insights to help decision-makers assess material risks, understand transition pathways, and establish 1.5 °C-aligned regulatory and environmental objectives.

S4S: What are your top priorities for the next five years?

Over the next five years, a central priority is to inform regulatory clarity and strengthen accountability for methane emissions within the IMO’s mid-term strategy and within regional regulatory frameworks, such as FuelEU. We want to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks that:

Adopt measured, evidence-based LNG emission factors from well-to-wake to ensure alignment with real-world performance data.

Account for methane’s full climate and societal impacts in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines, including its short-term warming potential (GWP20), as well as associated leakage, environmental, and health externalities.

Prevent market distortion by avoiding incentives or crediting mechanisms that reward LNG as a transitional fuel despite its climate risks.

Expand control measures to address all methane emission sources onboard ships, covering main and auxiliary engines, and also fugitive and process-related emissions.

Encourage economic measures that enable a Just and Equitable Transition and uphold the polluter-pays principle.

If we can strengthen the integrity of decarbonization efforts, we can move the sector tangibly towards true net-zero emissions. In our work to reduce the impact of emissions of super-pollutants from shipping in the Arctic, we want to urgently reduce black carbon emissions by moving to cleaner fuels but in doing so avoid moving from oil-based fuels to gas-based fuels i.e. LNG which would simply result in reducing emissions of one super-pollutant (black carbon) but increasing emissions of another (methane).

S4S: How does MARBEM define “beyond methane” — and what fuels or technologies does the initiative consider truly future-ready?

“Beyond methane” reflects a transition toward long-term solutions that are capable of achieving net-zero emissions. To achieve this, fuels and technologies must be climate-aligned, regulation-ready, and capable of delivering genuine decarbonization outcomes across their full life cycle. Methane is a super-pollutant, with a global warming potential 82.5 times that of CO₂ over 20 years and 29.8 times over 100 years. Its atmospheric concentration has more than doubled in the past two centuries, contributing an estimated 20–30% of observed global warming. In maritime transport, methane-based fuels – including fossil, bio, and e-LNG – remain the primary source of methane emissions, with these rising 180% between 2016 and 2023 from LNG-fuelled ships.

S4S: The maritime sector already hosts numerous decarbonization alliances — what distinguishes MARBEM’s approach or methodology from others?

Our work connects the micro-level analysis of methane-based fuels with the macro-level context of global decarbonization policy and finance. We focus on bridging the gap between high-level climate ambitions and practical decision-making by translating complex technical and academic research into actionable items for policymakers, financiers, and industry leaders. Unlike many initiatives that adopt a neutral approach, MARBEM provides clarity by identifying both what is and what is not a viable long-term solution. Understanding pseudo-solutions and “non-solutions” is essential to effective risk management — it enables decision-makers to avoid investments and policies that may increase exposure to stranded assets, regulatory misalignment, or reputational risk. Our evidence-based approach emphasizes data, measurability, and regulatory relevance and scenarios to support the sector to align investment and policy choices with scientifically grounded, net-zero pathways.

S4S: What are the most promising zero-emission fuel pathways MARBEM sees emerging as alternatives to LNG and other methane-based fuels?

From a precautionary and energy-centric perspective—rather than a narrow, fuel-centric one—wind propulsion and electrification technologies stand out as the most promising zero-emission and low-cost energy pathways for shipping. By delivering propulsive energy directly to the vessel, wind propulsion removes the climate, environmental, and social externalities associated with fuel life cycles, including extraction, production, and distribution. Energy efficiency is an underutilized tool with great potential to reduce emissions while cutting operational costs. This recent World Bank publication demonstrates that improving energy efficiency can reduce global shipping’s GHG emissions by up to roughly 40% by 2030 – surpassing the IMO’s current interim targets – while also cutting the overall cost of the transition, with annual savings of up to $220 billion. Let’s also consider that approximately 38% of global maritime trade volume is currently dedicated to oil and gas transport (UNCTAD, 2024). As the world is making the transition toward a zero-emissions future, we have a unique opportunity to rethink trade structures, volumes and cargoes at a systems level. Global trade will remain necessary but sourcing goods more locally and restructuring regionally can help to create a sector that is able to operate within planetary boundaries.

S4S: With the IMO’s delay in adopting the Net-Zero Framework, how do you see MARBEM contributing to a stronger and more inclusive outcome over the next year?

This one-year delay opens an opportunity for greater clarity, alignment, and integrity in the end result. Over the next year, we will focus on developing independent analyses, case studies and reports to increase political awareness of the myriad of risks associated with methane-based fuels in the shipping sector. Providing this data will allow member states to come to an informed decision while also ensuring the adopted framework achieves tangible GHG reductions and delivers on its goals. We need to focus on evidence and transparency, with specific emphasis on real-world data that accurately accounts for methane’s climate impacts and market realities. By translating complex technical and policy insights into clear, actionable analyses, we aim to support member states with their role in strengthening the framework.

S4S: What innovations in ship design, retrofitting, and fuel infrastructure would you like to see in the coming years?

For progress to be meaningful, ship design, retrofitting, and fuel infrastructure improvements must be guided by a systems-level approach—one that integrates climate, biodiversity, pollution prevention, and a just and equitable transition. We have seen how addressing shipping impacts in silos has led to fragmented and sometimes counterproductive responses to policies. For instance, measures aimed at reducing air pollution delivered the required reductions in SOx pollution but allowed shipping companies to circumvent the intended solutions – moving to cleaner fuels – and resulted in increasing ocean pollution with the use of scrubbers. A similar risk is created with onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS) since it will prolong use of fossil fuels instead of steering investments towards sustainable long-term solutions.Innovation has to be comprehensive. Its objective should be to simultaneously reduce greenhouse gases—including methane—while mitigating underwater noise, vessel strikes, air and water pollution, and effluent discharge. Advancements in energy efficiency, propulsion systems, and materials can deliver co-benefits across environmental and operational dimensions.

S4S: What policy or regulatory changes are most urgently needed to prevent a long-term “methane lock-in” in the shipping industry?

What is urgently needed now is clarity, consistency, and implementation. The IMO’s inclusion of methane emissions in its mid-term measures was critical, but short-term actions must now reflect the long-term decarbonization trajectory. According to the IPCC, global methane emissions must fall by one-third by 2030 and by nearly half by 2050 to maintain a 1.5°C pathway, an outlook that underscores there is a limited role for methane-based fuels in a zero-emissions future. In our opinion, the most pressing regulatory gap lies in ensuring that life-cycle assessment methodologies and emission factors accurately reflect real-world fuel performance and externalities – including methane leakage, short-term warming potential (GWP20), and the social, environmental, and health impacts. Without fully accounting for these factors, methane-based fuels will continue to be misrepresented as low-carbon solutions, with their perceived cost advantage reinforced by short-term industry cost-optimization. This puts the sector at risk of investing in assets and infrastructure that may become prematurely obsolete. Short-term market choices, like methane fuels, do not align with long-term climate, regulatory and market projections – and that’s why advancing data, integrity, transparency, and accountability in LCA guidelines and emissions accounting is so important right now.

S4S: In your view, what would a truly methane-free maritime industry look like by 2050?

A maritime industry that would operate with clear life-cycle accountability and with the environmental, social, health and economic costs of energy and infrastructure fully considered. The sector would be guided by evidence-based regulations while investment frameworks would contemplate more than short-term cost optimization. Methane-free shipping would also reflect a just and equitable transition, one that safeguards human health, biodiversity, water, and food systems, and upholds the land and resource rights of Indigenous and rural communities affected by fuel production and supply chains. Ultimately, a methane-free future for maritime transport would represent a future-proof industry: one that has reduced systemic risk, strengthened policy and financial coherence, and redefined competitiveness through transparency, accountability, and real climate integrity.

S4S: What message would you share with shipowners, ports, and governments that remain hesitant to move beyond LNG investments?

LNG is a risky bet that is likely to end in economic penalties and, eventually, stranded assets. The apparent cost advantage of LNG reflects a short-term optimization strategy that is hyped up by the oil and gas industry, even though LNG does not have a durable climate or market position. The LNG market already faces structural and policy headwinds that are starting to impact confidence in LNG and reshape investment patterns. LNG-fuelled newbuilds will likely continue to rise despite mounting evidence suggesting that not all contracts will be fulfilled, and that a pivot toward electrification and other non-methane solutions is already underway. Shipowners must consider the very real possibility of being locked into assets that will require expensive retrofits or early decommissioning, with research estimating £113–185 billion in potential stranded asset losses across LNG-capable fleets. Clear regulatory intervention continues to be the gap, but that too is slowly starting to emerge. It’s time for shipowners, ports and governments to reduce risks and make responsible business and regulatory decisions by moving away from the methane-pathway trap.

MARBEM highlights that any regulatory framework aiming to achieve net-zero emissions must include three core policy instruments:

· A carbon-intensity measure that drives performance improvements;

· A global fuel standard that ensures credible, science-based differentiation among fuels; and

· A GHG pricing system that internalizes external costs and steers investment toward scalable low- or zero-carbon options such as wind, while prioritizing the funding of decarbonization efforts and investments in the global south, small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs).

These must be guided by life-cycle (well-to-wake) assessment principles, ensuring decisions reflect full-system impacts rather than isolated emissions metrics.
