The report finds that while ships are becoming more fuel-efficient, rising economic activity, longer trade routes, and structural fleet trends continue to offset these gains. Shipping represented roughly 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2024—placing it on par with some G7 economies.

Container and Bulk Carriers Drive the Sector’s Footprint

Container ships and bulk carriers account for nearly half of global maritime CO₂ emissions. Over the five-year period, container ship emissions rose 14.7% while bulk carrier emissions increased 10.6%. The OECD attributes the spike largely to increased global trade volumes and higher transport intensity—tonne-miles growing faster than GDP.

Fleet characteristics also play a role. Vessels aged 20 years and older now number nearly 80,000 globally, up from about 70,000 in 2019, extending reliance on older, fossil-fueled hulls. Meanwhile, mega-containerships over 10,000 TEU now represent about 42% of the world’s container capacity. While these larger vessels offer better per-tonne fuel performance, they also lock in long-lived fossil infrastructure.

Efficiency Is Improving, but It’s Not Enough

The analysis uses a decomposition method to identify major forces influencing emissions. Fuel intensity—the fuel required per unit of nominal capacity—showed the strongest downward effect, indicating that ships are operating more efficiently due to slow steaming, operational improvements, and compliance with IMO’s Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). These regulatory shifts, however, have not significantly altered the sector’s fuel mix, which remains dominated by oil-based fuels despite growth in LNG and early adoption of methanol-ready designs.

Distance-driven emissions turned positive in the latter part of the period. Geopolitical disruptions—including Red Sea rerouting, Panama Canal constraints from drought, and altered trade flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—pushed vessels onto longer routes. This added millions of tonne-miles to global shipping activity and reduced the emissions benefits gained through efficiency.

Capacity utilization trends vary by region. Globally, underutilization has increased emissions by leaving more tonnage in operation than needed. In the OECD fleet, utilization improved slightly, exerting a modest downward effect.

Implications for Policy and the Maritime Transition

The OECD’s findings underscore the scale of the challenge facing the maritime sector as it works toward the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition and interim 2030 and 2040 reduction targets. Efficiency gains alone continue to be overtaken by market-driven factors—particularly the growth of global trade and rerouted maritime corridors.

Regulations entering force after 2024 will exert stronger pressure. The EU Emissions Trading System now applies to large ships entering European ports, and FuelEU Maritime will begin limiting the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels. These measures are expected to push operators toward low-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, or advanced biofuels—pathways that E+E Leader reporting has shown carry both potential and sustainability risks.

For companies with maritime-linked supply chains, the report highlights rising exposure to carbon costs and route volatility. Many firms are already reevaluating procurement strategies, assessing the carbon intensity of shipping partners, and tracking whether carriers invest in alternative-fuel vessels.

The OECD’s analysis ultimately reinforces a key trend across the global transport sector: operational efficiency is improving, but structural patterns in trade, fleet composition, and fuel availability are determining emissions outcomes. Without accelerated investment in low-carbon fuels and technologies, maritime emissions are likely to remain on an upward trajectory despite regulatory tightening.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251211-121247-b98-Ships%20and%20communication%20network%20concept.%20maritime%20traffic..jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:56:54.818319

The company aims to provide the global shipping industry with a new green, intelligent and sustainable development path. CATL expects that battery-electric ships will soon be active not only on rivers, lakes and harbours, but on the oceans.

Su Yiyi, Head of CATL’s Marine Division, stated at Marintec China: “CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes and coastal waters and is now evolving towards deep-sea applications. In the near future – possibly within the next three years – we will see fully electric ships on the open sea.”

Ships with a fragmented supplier system

According to CATL, the shipping industry currently faces a fundamental challenge: propulsion, energy supply and maintenance of a ship are typically managed by different partners, leading to coordination issues and unclear responsibilities. Additionally, battery-electric ships face high acquisition costs, a lack of energy infrastructure, range anxiety, complex water conditions and inconsistent technical standards.

These factors represent a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of zero-emission shipping. Moreover, technologies from road transport cannot simply be transferred to ships, as their development must account for extremely demanding conditions such as high humidity, salt spray, long operating hours and high power requirements.

CATL’s new complete solution for battery-electric ships

This is where CATL’s integrated “Ship-Shore-Cloud” solution comes into play. According to the company, it is a bespoke complete solution for the shipping industry, featuring seamless integration from onboard energy systems to landside charging and battery-swapping networks, and cloud-based intelligent management. This approach aims to eliminate the traditional weaknesses of the industry’s fragmented multi-supplier structures.

Onboard, the system integrates batteries, propulsion and intelligent navigation systems to ensure safe and stable operation. On land, a network of charging and battery-swapping stations, along with the “ship-battery separation” model, is designed to significantly reduce energy and cost risks.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems. One example is the excursion ship Yujian 77, which operates in Xiamen Bay and has already been featured by us. CATL is also proud of the Changjiang Sanxia 1, the world’s largest fully electric inland passenger ship, and the Qinggang Tug 1, China’s first hybrid tugboat. Additionally, with the Jining 6006, CATL has demonstrated that battery swapping for cargo ships is feasible.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios.","The shipping industry's ongoing battle with container losses at sea reveals a complex web of environmental consequences and supply chain vulnerabilities that extend far beyond the initial moment cargo goes overboard.

Each year, thousands of containers slip into the ocean, transforming single shipping incidents into chronic pollution sources that persist for decades while simultaneously disrupting global trade networks.

The mechanics behind these losses combine natural forces with human and technical failures. Rough seas, high waves and strong winds create the immediate physical threat, particularly when containers are improperly stacked or inadequately lashed. Human factors including fatigue, poor communication and complacency during loading operations compound these risks, while mechanical issues such as valve failures or uneven weight distribution further exacerbate the problem.

Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC) says: ""Even one container lost is one too many.”

Decades of marine plastic pollution

A February 1997 incident involving the Tokio Express, operating under Evergreen Marine's service at the time, demonstrates how a single container loss can become a long-term environmental liability. Hit by a large wave off the coast of Cornwall, the vessel lost 62 containers overboard, including one loaded with millions of Lego pieces.

The lost cargo has washed up for decades on beaches in Southwest England, making it one of the best-known examples of traceable marine plastic pollution. Many of the Lego pieces were ocean-themed items such as flippers and octopuses, providing marine scientists with valuable long-term data on plastic persistence and drift patterns.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents. Beachcombers and researchers still document finds of these distinctive pieces, creating an ongoing record of marine debris movement.

The longevity of these plastic items in the marine environment highlights the persistent nature of polymer-based materials. This single container loss has generated decades of environmental impact and scientific observation.

Perishable cargo environmental footprint

Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.

On 15 November 2025, a vessel transporting bananas for major importers and retailers lost several containers in the English Channel, leading to large numbers of loose bananas, broken boxes and associated packaging washing up along parts of the UK coast.

While the fruit itself biodegrades, the long-term environmental burden comes from non-biodegradable elements such as plastic wrap, strapping, pallets, insulation and cooler foams that persist in marine environments. These materials fragment into microplastics over time, entering the food chain.

The visual impact of perishable cargo losses often generates significant public attention and media coverage. However, the less visible packaging materials create the more enduring pollution problem.

Refrigerated containers also contain coolants and insulation materials that can release harmful substances when compromised. The environmental footprint of these losses extends well beyond the organic cargo itself.

Industrial materials contaminating coastlines

Beyond consumer goods and perishables, industrial materials constitute some of the most severe marine pollution incidents.

The X-Press Pearl incident off Sri Lanka in 2021 released 70 to 75 billion plastic pellets, known as ""nurdles"", now considered one of the largest marine plastic spills in history. The ship was operated by X-Press Feeders and carried cargo for multiple chemical and polymer producers.

These tiny plastic pellets, the raw material for plastic manufacturing, spread rapidly across vast ocean areas and coastlines. Their small size makes recovery virtually impossible, and they persist indefinitely in marine ecosystems.

Other notable cases include consumer goods such as trainers, motorbikes, televisions, whisky and IKEA products arriving on beaches after container losses on major Asia-Europe and transpacific routes. Biobeads and industrial polymers have contaminated shorelines in the UK and elsewhere, creating pollution challenges that differ markedly from organic cargo losses.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios. Each material type requires different clean-up approaches and presents unique environmental risks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/67d4c168c5d3f1fe3d45b35a36f722bd:d38a7b3e0c2c0929be02941b3ebacd31/gettyimages-1032544878.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:56:52.432224

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect.
Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.
The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.
This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.","A lot is expected of global trade nowadays when it comes to sustainability. That said, heavy freight is still widely regarded as a hard-to-abate sector.

Air and sea shipping are the main culprits here. While lorries are able to carry just a fraction of the loads of planes and boats, there are readily available electric alternatives to old school, fossil fuel-powered road vehicles.

Progress is well underway though, whether that's the development of sustainable aviation fuel or the kinds of biofuel or hydrogen that boats are experimenting with.

Regulations are being written to reflect and encourage this gradual transition too. When it comes to ships specifically, a new piece of research by the International Maritime Organization has sought to examine just how effective legislation is at the moment when it comes to nautical sustainability.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the IMO's study is full of data that could prove crucial for how supply chain professionals understand the day-to-day impact of global fuel rules.

The report, which is titled SO₂ and NOₓ emissions from ships in North‑East Atlantic waters, sets out to measure sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) directly, using aircraft and onshore sensors to sample exhaust plumes from 2019 to 2022.

This approach offers a more precise picture of emissions for a sector that operates largely beyond easy observation.

What kind of impact is tighter regulation having on shipping?

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect. Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.

By 2021, this had dropped to roughly 0.31%, and further declined to 0.25% by 2022.

Researchers concluded that “a nearly 10-fold decrease in the mean aFSC demonstrates the strong impact the International Maritime Organization regulation change in 2020 had on sulphur emissions from ships.”

The findings underline a smooth transition toward lower-sulphur fuels across the sector.

The study also gauged nitrogen oxide emissions, finding that the NOₓ/CO₂ ratio was significantly lower in ports than at sea, probably because ships rely on smaller auxiliary engines when docked – an operational factor with implications for port logistics and emission tracking.

How are companies complying with sustainable shipping restrictions?

The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.

In 2019, before the new restrictions, eight of the 19 ships sampled surpassed the 3.5% sulphur threshold then in force.

By contrast, during 2021–2022, only five of the 78 ships tested were non‑compliant under the tougher 0.5% cap. This high level of compliance demonstrates the regulation’s effectiveness, although a small proportion of breaches remains.

Failure to comply still poses risks for supply chain stakeholders, ranging from shipment delays to reputational repercussions.

Collecting this evidence required complex operations, including flying an aircraft at altitudes as low as 30 metres to capture and analyse 130 ship exhaust plumes.

The finer details of the study

Within special environmental zones like the European Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA), stretching across the English Channel, the limits are even stricter. Average sulphur content in these waters was measured at around 0.04%, well below the 0.1% ceiling.

Direct measurements enabled scientists to flag non‑compliant ships that computer models might miss. For example, one container vessel exceeded sulphur limits on the open sea but switched to cleaner fuel closer to shore within SECA boundaries.

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a0d4400bb489589df7433fda5bd66a6c:0d118856c8132941191580789cbe12e2/graphics-for-work-2025-12-10t172834-228.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:04.742795

The new group plans to work with President Trump’s Administration and Congress to establish strong policies that accelerate the use of American-made energy and biofuels in the global maritime sector – thereby establishing U.S. dominance in the future of international maritime shipping.

Adding biofuels such as ethanol, biomethane, bio-LNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel, among others, to the existing maritime fuel portfolio can fill opportunity gaps and help shippers meet both their economic and environmental goals.

Maritime fuel policies and international frameworks are developing rapidly. Incentivizing the increased use of biofuels creates an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made energy produced from feedstocks grown in the United States like corn, sorghum, and soybeans, as well as the organic byproducts and farm waste from several domestic industries. The maritime sector represents a new opportunity to strongly position American farmers and fuel producers to lead in a developing market, leveraging existing infrastructure and encouraging new investments in energy and maritime sectors while enhancing the economic resilience of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

ABMI will advocate for policies that expand market access for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers in maritime applications, and the advancement of technologies that deploy these advanced fuels, planning to work with the Trump Administration and Congress to establish the U.S. as a global leader in maritime fuels policy.

“Every day, America generates organic waste that should be turned into clean, domestic energy. U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies. The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of RFA and ABMI co-chair, said: “The maritime sector represents an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from crops grown across America’s heartland. U.S. ethanol is one of the lowest-cost alternative maritime fuels available at scale and represents an incredibly competitive option for the shipping industry worldwide.”

Thoughtfully crafted international frameworks and national policies can drive demand for U.S. agricultural and waste-derived fuels and therefore support American farmers, biofuel producers, and the rural communities that produce them.

This mandate has triggered the most significant technological and financial upheaval the sector has ever faced. This article explores the core challenge—the decarbonization dilemma—focusing on the complex regulatory landscape (CII, ETS) and the intense, multi-fuel race to find viable, scalable, and safe ""green fuels."" We analyze the leading contenders—ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen—highlighting their pros, cons, and the colossal infrastructure investment required to power the future of global shipping.

The Green Fuel Race: Solving the Decarbonization Dilemma

The biggest hurdle is the ""decarbonization dilemma"": the need to commit billions to a specific fuel pathway without a guaranteed global supply or regulatory consensus. Currently, three contenders dominate the discussion:

1. Green Methanol 🟢

Pros: A well-understood liquid fuel that can be handled using near-conventional bunkering infrastructure. It offers a clear, immediate pathway for transitioning internal combustion engines.

Cons: Lower energy density than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), meaning larger tanks are required, reducing cargo space. While it burns cleanly, it is highly toxic and its production must be verified as ""green"" (from biomass or renewable hydrogen) to meet climate goals.

2. Green Ammonia ( 🔵

Pros: Expected to be highly scalable and cost-effective as a carrier for hydrogen. It is considered a zero-carbon fuel at the point of combustion (no $\text{CO}_2$ emissions).

Cons: **Highly toxic** and corrosive, requiring extensive new safety protocols and material changes for engines and tanks. Its combustion can produce nitrous oxides ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), a potent GHG, posing a serious environmental and technical challenge.

3. Green Hydrogen ⚪

Pros: A true zero-emission fuel (water is the only byproduct). Can be used in fuel cells, offering extremely high efficiency for smaller, shorter-distance vessels.

Cons: Requires cryogenic storage and has an extremely low energy density by volume, demanding massive tank sizes. The infrastructure for production, storage, and bunkering is virtually non-existent for deep-sea shipping.

Beyond the Tank: Technology and Operational Efficiency

Decarbonization involves more than just swapping fuels. Immediate and complementary steps are being taken to reduce energy demand and bridge the gap until green fuels are universally available.

Energy Saving Devices (ESDs): Technology such as propeller boss cap fins, air lubrication systems, and optimized hull coatings that physically reduce drag and improve hydrodynamic performance.

Wind-Assisted Propulsion (WAPs): The re-emergence of wind power using modern rotor sails or wing sails to supplement engine power, significantly reducing fuel consumption on long voyages.

Digital Optimization: Using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and advanced software for dynamic route optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time performance monitoring to minimize fuel burn.

Conclusion: The Cost of Transition and the Path Forward

The journey to net-zero is characterized by immense capital expenditure: billions must be spent on new vessels, engine retrofits, and global bunkering infrastructure. This investment carries a ""first mover"" risk, but also offers a first-mover advantage in charter markets demanding green shipping solutions.

The industry consensus is moving toward a **multi-fuel future**, where different vessel types and trade routes will adopt the most suitable green fuel. Success hinges on unprecedented collaboration between energy producers, technology providers, regulators, and financiers to ensure safety, scalability, and ultimately, a viable, sustainable future for global trade.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.
So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?
Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings.
COSCO SHIPPING Holdings does have some risks, we noticed we think you should know about.","What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings ( ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for COSCO SHIPPING Holdings, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.11 = CN¥43b ÷ (CN¥500b - CN¥130b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 5.4% generated by the Shipping industry.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?

Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 11%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 106%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.

The Key Takeaway

A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 416% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Under the theme “Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean,” the conference emphasized the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14), which targets life below water through a three-pronged Nice Ocean Action Plan.

The three main priorities of the conference included:

Completing multilateral processes related to the ocean.

Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable ocean initiatives.

Strengthening and disseminating marine science knowledge to improve policy-making.

A pivotal aspect of the UNOC was progress on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty, adopted in 2023. This treaty is an international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) aimed at conserving and sustainably utilizing marine biodiversity in international waters. Key components of the treaty involve establishing marine protected areas (MPAs), mandating environmental impact assessments for high-seas activities, regulating access to marine genetic resources, and providing capacity-building support to developing nations. The treaty aligns with global biodiversity goals, pushing for the protection of 30% of marine and coastal areas by 2030.

Despite 160 countries signing the BBNJ Treaty, only 56 have ratified it, with a requirement of 60 ratifications needed to initiate a 120-day countdown for it to become legally binding. Both India and the United States have not yet ratified it, with India in the process of doing so, and the U.S. still evaluating its position.

The conference acknowledged significant hurdles in advancing the BBNJ Treaty. Disputes over how to share benefits from marine genetic resources, lack of consensus on regulating extraction activities, and warnings about potential risks to ocean ecosystems and biodiversity are major challenges.

Several notable achievements were recorded at UNOC, including:

Financial Commitments: The European Commission pledged over €1 billion, with Germany, New Zealand, and other nations making substantial contributions towards ocean conservation and governance.

Expansion of Marine Protected Areas: French Polynesia committed to creating the world’s largest marine protected area, while Spain planned five new MPAs to protect a significant portion of its marine territory.

Global Coalitions and Initiatives: The conference saw the establishment of the High Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean to address noise pollution and the One Ocean Finance process, which aims to secure funding from blue economy sectors.

In conclusion, the UNOC 2025 made headway in ocean protection through financial pledges, treaty advocacy, and the formation of coalitions, laying the groundwork for stronger governance of international waters and promoting sustainable practices in line with global biodiversity goals.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-10 19:56:08.306689

Benefits of autonomous ships Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety.
The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.
By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.
This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.","Autonomous vessels are set to revolutionize the shipping industry, whereby they will gradually and eventually transform global maritime trade through advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technologies and remote operations. As traditional shipping faces ever-growing challenges - from aging fleets to rising safety concerns to ever-increasing environmental rules and regulations - autonomous ships offer a compelling solution that promises increased efficiency and safety whilst simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and operational costs.

Whereas fully unmanned ships remain on the horizon, 2025 marks a pivotal milestone as semi-autonomous ships enter practical commercial service, leveraging remote control centres and advanced AI-driven navigation to optimise routs, enhance situational awareness and mitigate human error. Supported by regulatory frameworks and rapid technological advancements, autonomous shipping is set to become a cornerstone of the maritime industry, ushering in a new era where intelligent machines and human oversight work cohesively to redefine how goods move across our oceans.

The IMO's involvement

For the past few years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already been laying the groundwork for the eventual widespread introduction of autonomous ships into the shipping industry. The aim of the IMO is to regulate new and advancing technologies through its framework, whereby they seek to balance the benefits from said technologies against concerns of security and safety, the impact on the environment and on the facilitation of international trade, the potential costs to the shipping industry and their impact on personnel, both onboard and on shore. IMO wants to ensure the framework regulating Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) keeps up the rapidly evolving technological developments.

Following the completion of the IMO's scoping exercise on MASS back in 2021, the main goal of which was to assess which existing IMO instruments could apply to ships of varying degrees of automation, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), through its 109th session, agreed to a revised roadmap for the development of an official MASS Code.

The scoping exercise covered four degrees of autonomy regarding MASS, these being:

1. Ships with automated processes and decision support systems. Seafarers are still present onboard to operate and control the ship's systems and functions. Certain operations may be automated and at times unsupervised, with seafarers onboard ready to take control in case of malfunctions or errors.

2. Remote-controlled ships with seafarers on board. The ship is controlled and operated from another location whereby seafarers are available onboard to take and operate the ship's systems and functions.

3. Remote-controlled ships without seafarers onboard. The ship is controlled from another location without the presence of the human element onboard.

4. Fully autonomous ships. The operating system of these ships would be able to make decisions and determine specific actions by itself.

The outcome of this scoping exercise highlighted a number of critical issues which were present across several of the IMO's instruments, whereby these involved the creation of MASS terminology and definitions, including an internationally agreed definition of MASS and clarification on the definitions of ""master"", ""crew"" and ""responsible person"", particularly in Degrees Three (remote-controlled ships) and Four (fully autonomous ships) as described earlier.

Other key issues identified included the need to address the functional and operational requirements of the remote-control station/centre and the possible designation of a remote operator as seafarer. Further potential gaps that were identified related to manual operations and alarms on the bridge, provisions related to actions by personnel such as firefighting, cargo stowage and securing, maintenance, search and rescue, watchkeeping and information required to be kept onboard for safe operation of the ship.

At the following session, at MSC 110, the abovementioned roadmap was fine-tuned and the committee agreed on the following milestones:

MSC 111 (scheduled for May 2026) will aim to finalise and adopt the non-mandatory MASS Code;

MSC 112 (scheduled for December 2026) will seek to develop a framework for the Experience-Building Phase (EBP) of MASS;

The IMO plans to kickstart development of the mandatory MASS Code in 2028, based on the non-mandatory MASS Code and results from the EBP;

By 1st July 2030 at the latest, the goal is to have widespread adoption of the mandatory MASS Code, whilst its entry into force is scheduled for 1st January 2032, at the earliest.

It is important to keep in mind that the non-mandatory MASS will merely act as a supplement to The International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and that its entry into force will not automatically relax any of the requirements as laid out under the latter. Exemptions from the requirements of SOLAS must be agreed upon by the flag State during the approval process of the non-mandatory MASS Code.

Key issues that are yet to be addressed are the roles and responsibilities of both the master and the remote operator, general questions surrounding liability and the onboard carriage of certificates. The IMO determined that its internal committees are to discuss these issues at future meetings before taking an official position on the way forward, seeing as this will affect the global shipping industry.

Benefits of autonomous ships

Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety. One of the biggest achievements would be mitigation of human error, seeing as it is the cause behind 96% of all maritime incidents. The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.

Moreover, autonomous vessels optimize route planning and engine performance, ensuring improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs. The reduction, and eventual elimination of onboard crew requirements not only cuts costs of labour but also allows ships to be designed with more cargo space, further enhancing economic viability.

On the environmental front, autonomous ships contribute to cleaner maritime operations by minimizing fuel consumption through optimized navigation and the integration of alternative, low-emission fuels. These vessels are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems that swiftly detect and mitigate environmental risks such as oil spills or leaks. By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Autonomous ships, by virtue of their advanced automation and optimized operation, are estimated to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aligning with European Union's (EU) stringent emission reduction targets, one of these being the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS).

EU ETS, which operates on a cap-and-trade principle, enables shipping companies buy and sell allowances for their emissions, meaning that autonomous vessels could benefit from lower allowance costs due to their cleaner operations. This creates an incentive for shipping operators to adopt MASS technologies, as the reduced emissions directly translate into fewer allowances needed and thus, lower compliance costs and aligning with the market-driven push towards a globally greener shipping sector.

Furthermore, the EU's ongoing integration of carbon removal technologies highlights a broader policy environment where innovations like MASS can contribute significantly to achieving ambitious net-zero goals while benefiting from and contributing to a sustainable, market-based climate policy system.

The pitfalls of autonomy

Autonomous ships, whilst offering revolutionary benefits, come with significant challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and reliable integration into the maritime industry. One of the foremost concerns is cybersecurity. These vessels, being heavily dependent on digital communication and automated control systems, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks.

Such breaches could disrupt navigation, impair situational awareness or even hijack control of the ship, potentially leading to collisions, environmental disasters or theft of cargo. Given the complexity of integrating operational technology with information technology systems, the security framework for autonomous ships requires robust design, continuous monitoring, and real-time anomaly detection to effectively mitigate these risks.

Operationally, autonomous vessels face technical and regulatory pitfalls. The reliability of AI in interpreting complex and unpredictable maritime environments remains a challenge, especially under adverse weather or congested port conditions. Additionally, the legal landscape has yet to fully catch up, with ambiguities surrounding insurance coverage and compliance with international maritime conventions.

The human element also plays a major role as the transition to autonomous operations confronts resistance from seafarers concerned about job security and highlights the need for new training paradigms for remote operators and shore-based personnel. Lastly, the high upfront investment costs and the infrastructural changes required to accommodate autonomous ships add layers of financial and logistical complexity that may slow widespread adoption. Overall, these challenges call for a cautious, phased implementation strategy coupled with ongoing technological innovation and international regulatory cooperation.

Conclusion

The rise of autonomous vessels represents a transformative leap for the shipping industry, bringing with it promises to enhance safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability whilst simultaneously reshaping fundamental operational standards and principles. Central to this evolution is the proactive role of the IMO in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to MASS.

With the IMO's ongoing efforts culminating in the forthcoming MASS Code, regulations are being crafted to address critical aspects such as navigation autonomy, safety management, liability and crew responsibilities both in remote and in fully autonomous operations. This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.

One of the IMO's principal goals is the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by about 2050, in tandem with interim goals for reducing the carbon footprint in shipping.

Malaysia prioritises the adoption of low-carbon technology and fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, and hydrogen, in order to accomplish fleet carbon reductions.

We seek to decrease our maritime carbon footprint by incentivising shipowners to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient designs and alternative propulsion systems, consequently complying with the IMO's Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator requirements.

As a key player in Southeast Asia's trade routes, Malaysia has the potential to leverage this role to align national policies with IMO objectives, therefore assuring sustainability, safety, and competitiveness in an evolving global shipping environment.

The upcoming Malaysia Maritime Masterplan 2026–2040, scheduled for launch next year, will serve as a framework for changing the nation's marine industry into a resilient, sustainable, and competitive structure.

From an academic perspective, the 2026–2040 framework represents our most concerted effort to synchronise maritime governance, infrastructure modernisation, and blue economy development.

It builds upon lessons learnt from the Malaysia Shipping Master Plan 2017–2022 (MSMP), which strengthened fleet competitiveness, promoted regulatory transparency, and cultivated maritime human capital.

While the MSMP achieved significant progress, challenges remained in ship financing, port integration, innovation adoption, and workforce sustainability, all of which are being addressed under the new masterplan.

The Maritime Masterplan integrates climate action and low-carbon initiatives into domestic shipping operations.

This not only aligns with IMO's environmental guidelines but also establishes Malaysia as a leader in sustainable shipping within Asean, attracting environmentally-aware multinational carriers and decreasing operational costs via enhanced efficiency.

Maritime safety is also among the fundamental objectives of the masterplan, with continuous initiatives aimed at accident prevention, piracy and robbery suppression, and the welfare of seafarers.

In order to stay competitive, Malaysia's plans emphasise digitalisation and trade facilitation to preserve its competitive advantage.

The masterplan emphasises human capital development, targeting the specialised training of maritime professionals in digital competencies, maritime cybersecurity, and sustainable operations, targeting the global deficit of proficient seafarers.

By cultivating a skilled workforce, Malaysia guarantees that its shipping industry stays adaptable in the face of technology challenges, like autonomous boats and AI-driven operations.

Malaysia's dedication to the Women in Maritime initiative is equally vital, aligning with the IMO's enduring goal of enhancing female representation within the industry.

We seek to develop a more diverse, innovative, and future-ready maritime workforce by enhancing educational opportunities, advancing leadership programmes and enacting gender-inclusive policies at work.

The masterplan advocates for the blue economy, utilising marine resources to foster sustainable development in sectors like aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and tourism.

This comprehensive strategy fulfils IMO objectives and bolsters Malaysia's competitiveness by attracting foreign direct investment, generating employment, and augmenting its participation in global trade volumes.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.

This comprehensive 15-year strategy outlines a framework for addressing issues such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, and technology advancements, while leveraging opportunities in global commerce.

The S&P 500 gained 0.31%, continuing the divergence between broader markets and LNG shipping stocks. Trading volume hit a record high, signalling strong investor engagement at this crucial technical level.

New Fortress Energy led gains with a 29% surge, while Korea Line Corporation jumped 14% on very high volume, breaking out of its summer sideways range. On the downside, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation fell 5.3% to support levels. Natural gas prices continue to diverge: Asian JKM declined to $10.66/mmBtu—near the threshold that attracts smaller buyers—while Henry Hub surpassed $5/mmBtu. Despite fundamentals remaining robust, with Atlantic spot rates at $130,000/day, most companies now stand on the cusp of change, testing support levels that will determine the sector’s next direction.

UPI & SPX

The UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 1.70 points (1.05%), closing at 160.72 points, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.31%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.

Broader View

UPI has reached its long-term support level, similar to the end of 2023, when growth in the final weeks of the year pushed the index into positive territory. We will discuss this topic in more detail in the Chart of the Week on our website.

The price of natural gas for Asia is declining slowly, while it is declining more rapidly for Europe. This is due to warmer weather. Interestingly, the price of US gas (Henry Hub) is rising and has surpassed $5 per mmBtu. The price of January deliveries to Asia dropped from $10.90/mmBtu to $10.66/mmBtu, which, according to Argus Media, is close to the threshold that attracts smaller Asian buyers. According to S&P Global Energy, the daily reference price for January deliveries to Western Europe (NWM), based on ex-ship (DES), is $8.787/mmBtu, representing a $0.45/mmBtu discount compared to the price at the TTF hub. Daily spot prices for LNG tankers remain at $130,000 for the Atlantic and $87,500 for the Pacific, according to Spark Commodities.

The declining price of gas will boost demand, but shipping company shares are dropping. One reason is the limited influence of spot rates on fleets mainly operating under long-term contracts.

The ratio of declining to rising companies from UPI was 12:9, with a median movement of -0.26%. Trading volume reached a record high.

Constituents

The declines were not significant, remaining below 2%, with many less than half a per cent. However, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation (SS: 600026) experienced the most severe loss, falling by 5.3%. The price reached a support level amid increased volume, and the coming weeks will determine the next direction.

The second company with a loss beginning with a two is NYK Line (TSE: 9101). Here, the loss was 2.4%. Despite this decline, the share price remains above support, although only just.

Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) and Exmar (BSE: EXM) recorded almost identical losses, differing by one hundredth of a per cent. These were 1.37% and 1.38%, respectively. Nevertheless, Awilco seems to be poised for more significant growth for the second week in a row, while Exmar is moving sideways.

In percentage terms, further changes are not significant, but one group demonstrates a broader trend. This primarily involves the ongoing movement towards support levels of individual companies. This applies to MISC (KLSE: 3816), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), “K” Line (TSE: 9107), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

Among the rising companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again led with a nearly 29% increase, while Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) rose by almost 14%. KLC broke out of its sideways trend on very high volume and nearly reached the highest prices within its sideways trading range since the summer.

Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rose nearly 5%, trying to sustain its growth trend after a correction.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) made another attempt to rebound from support, rising 4.17%. It has not yet broken through the range.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) increased for the second consecutive week, returning to its previously broken support level. The rise was 3.6%.

Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) made a cautious attempt at growth, rising above the primary resistance zone, which is a price level that has not been sustained. The increase was 2.1%.

Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) remains in the support area but records a 0.5% growth.

The overall impression of the individual companies is therefore not negative, but they are on the cusp of change. However, strong fundamentals do not justify a long-term break through support levels; quite the opposite.

Crystal Ball

The late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to its previous range, where it now trades. This area provides firm support. In the short term, we estimate a rise in volatility of UPI´s constituents.

Marina executive director Samuel Batalla affirmed their readiness to provide technical assistance to help ensure compliance with the STCW Convention. The Philippines offered to formalize the recognition of seafarers’ certificates under Regulation I/10 and issued a letter of assurance outlining the development of a tailored technical cooperation program.

The initiative aims to drive coordinated research, investment and deployment across industries with high emissions.

A Strategic Push for Hard-to-Abate Sectors

The roadmap focuses on sectors such as cement, power and steel—areas where emissions are difficult to reduce with conventional methods. By promoting CCUS, India aims to develop scalable solutions that can extract, utilise or store carbon dioxide generated from industrial and energy systems.

Government Funding and Institutional Support

Launched by the Principal Scientific Adviser Ajay Kumar Sood, the initiative will draw from the government’s ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development and Innovation funding pathways. This support is expected to accelerate breakthroughs and reduce technology-deployment timelines. Earlier this year, the government also announced five CCU testbeds in the cement sector to create a research cluster for industrial decarbonisation.

How CCUS Works and Global Debate

CCUS includes processes that separate CO₂, compress and transport it, and inject it into geological formations for permanent storage. Alternatively, captured CO₂ may be reused as feedstock for industrial products. While CCUS is widely viewed as essential for net-zero transitions, some experts warn it may prolong fossil fuel dependence and add greenhouse emissions if not deployed carefully.

India launched its first national CCUS R&D roadmap in 2025.

The initiative supports the 2070 net-zero emissions target.

₹1 lakh crore RDI funding will accelerate CCUS technologies.

Shipping is becoming more complex, and Anglo-Eastern is responding with it. 2025 brought significant uncertainty, with changing regulations and tariffs being the biggest topics. Anglo-Eastern reflagged certain vessels in response to tariffs, though always at the owner’s discretion.

The company manages more than 50 dual-fuel vessels of various fuels, with 87 under newbuilding and project management. Highlights include Windcat Rotterdam (IMO: 9995337), a next-generation offshore support vessel, as well as the first wind-assisted aframax, Brands Hatch (IMO: 1034199), and two ammonia-ready newcastlemaxes.

In 2025, Anglo-Eastern launched Sustainability and Performance Services, combining environmental compliance and performance services to help owners, charterers and operators. It boasts that its tools have saved a combined 225,000 tonnes of fuel, or $135m.

Anglo-Eastern set a 2030 target for 30% of its officers to be promoted to management before turning 30, to speed up certifications earlier in their careers.

02 / Tommy Olofsen, OSM Thome

Norway’s OSM Thome heads into 2026 under the new leadership of group managing director Tommy Olofsen, following the retirement in November 2025 of chief executive Finn Amund Norbye.

The 2023 mega-merger of OSM Maritime Group and Singapore’s Thome Ship Management created a giant with more than 1,000 ships under management, employing some 30,000 seafarers, from 20 offices around the world.

Asset manager Oaktree, which bought into OSM Maritime Group in 2018, sold its stake to JP Morgan Asset Management in August. OSM founder Bjørn Tore Larsen and Skagerak Holding, owned by the Eek Thorstensen family that founded Thome, continue to have “significant ownership stakes” in OSM Thome.

03 / René Kofod-Olsen, V.Group

René Kofod-Olsen takes issue with calling V.Group a mere technical manager, preferring “global shipping services company”. What matters is not the number of ships under management, he says, but “the quality that we are delivering on those ships”.

That said, with 900 ships in its fleet — and sizeable services and digital divisions expected to stand on their own two feet — V.Group is in a good position.

Kofod-Olsen says scale is increasingly important in his business as the industry gets more complex. Shipmanagers running 50 or fewer ships are fighting an uphill battle, he warned in November 2025.

V.Group is working with tanker company International Seaways to make ships more female-friendly. Kofod-Olsen said diversity was a “must-win battle for the entire industry”.

04 / Jesper Kristensen, Synergy Marine

Jesper Kristensen joined as Synergy’s group chief executive in March, after 34 years at Unifeeder, and succeeding long-time leader Rajesh Unni.

Company highlights over the past 12 months included a carbon capture refit on an LR1 tanker, one of the first in its class, and converting a 30-year-old liquefied natural gas carrier into a modern floating storage and regasification unit.

The company is expanding into managing methanol-fuelled containerships for an Asian shipowner and formed a joint venture with a Norwegian operator of geared bulkers.

A sea training institute in India will open in 2026 with capacity for 500 trainees a year. The group also expects more consolidation among mid-tier managers as compliance, digital and ESG requirements intensify.

05 / Sebastian von Hardenberg, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement

Hamburg-based BSM strengthened its expertise in the LNG segment, when its LNG specialty arm Pronav took on management of the FSRU Turquoise P (IMO: 9823883) in the Aegean Sea near Izmir, Turkey.

BSM took on the first methanol vessel, has 50 ships with LNG engines, and announced it will manage the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel.

It has six maritime training centres — the most recent opened in Ghana in August — as well as 10 shipmanagement centres and 28 crew service centres. The company employs 40,000 crew and 2,000 people on shore.

06 / Rajalingam Subramaniam, Fleet Management

Fleet Management is part of Hong Kong’s Caravel Group, led by commodity trading legend Harry Banga and his son Angad Banga.

2025 was its first year under managing director Rajalingam Subramaniam, who joined from Malaysian shipowner MISC in January.

It opened its first Athens office that month, and in March acquired the International Maritime Institute, a training centre in Noida, India. It is expanding in Japan and the Philippines, where it opened an enlarged crewing and training facility in the capital Manila.

The company has 620 ships under technical management (300 bulkers, 220 tankers and 100 containerships and PCTCS), with another 130 newbuildings in the pipeline.

07 / Mark O’Neil, Columbia

Columbia Group has expanded across its integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, and energy and offshore services platform in 2025.

The company got into the FuelEU Maritime pooling business through its EmissionsLink platform, hoping to capitalise on confusion over emissions rules — especially since the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework delay, which the company warned could lead to overlapping regional rules.

Columbia formed a JV in 2025 with Egypt’s Pan Marine Shipping Services, saying this will let it work more closely with local talent and institutions.

08 / Haakon Lenz, Wilhelmsen Ship Management

Norway’s Wilhelmsen Ship Management, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, is now under the leadership of Haakon Lenz, following the retirement of chief executive Carl Schou.

The company has come a long way since it was born out of the Hong Kong liner service Barber Blue Seas in 1975.

Lenz has said having just over 300 vessels is about where the company needs to be, if it is to make the most of efficiencies while keeping in touch with customers and seafarers.

The company hopes to convince owners of the benefits of third-party shipmanagement by helping deal with more complicated regulations.

09 / Guo Jinkui, Seacon Shipping Group

China’s Seacon Shipping has continued to grow steadily, with notable progress in crew-only management in 2025. The company attributes this to enhanced crew training, especially for LNG and car carriers.

The company has also got into the ship leasing business, acquiring 40% of CIMC Xinde Leasing, and establishing the first FuelEU compliance pool in China.

Seacon says it has also recently developed a “Seacon-AI” model to enhance its capability and efficiency. Approval from the China Classification Society has also been gained for its new shipmanagement software platform.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.","The global shipping industry is facing an escalating human-resources crisis as more seafarers leave life at sea for work ashore, according to reporting by Paul Bartlett, who noted during a COP30 side-event titled ‘The Global Seafarer Emergency’ that the trend now threatens the safe operation of the fleet carrying more than 80 per cent of world trade.

Growing dissatisfaction among crews reflects a familiar list of pressures, bullying, discrimination, excessive working hours, fatigue, little or no shore leave and limited connectivity with family and friends.

In many cases, contracts are extended for months, contributing to sustained physical and psychological strain.

At the webinar, Lloyd’s Register Chief Marketing Officer Philippa Charlton said shipping underpins global trade across containers, dry and liquid cargo, and gases.

She added that the sector’s shift to low- and zero-carbon fuels requires extensive new training in methanol, ammonia and hydrogen for both new recruits and existing seafarers.

Lloyd’s Register Foundation Chief Executive Ruth Boumphrey outlined the scale of the challenge.

Around 1.9 million seafarers currently work on 112,500 merchant ships worldwide, with half coming from the Asia-Pacific region, 33 per cent from Europe and 4 per cent from Africa, while women account for just 1.3 per cent of the global workforce.

She also noted that 64 per cent have not received any training on decarbonisation or new fuels over the past two years. By 2030, an estimated 450,000 will require specialist training, rising to 800,000 thereafter.

Recent data elsewhere reinforce the seriousness of the situation.

The International Chamber of Shipping estimates the global seafaring workforce at 1,892,720, while a Drewry forecast points to a shortage of senior officers reaching 10 per cent by 2030 due to fleet expansion, early retirements and limited new entry.

Surveys also show deteriorating conditions: one 2025 study found 42 per cent of seafarers plan to retire early, with many reporting delayed or incomplete wage payments.

Meanwhile, the ITF recorded a 30 per cent surge in abandonment cases in 2025, with more than 2,286 seafarers stranded on 222 vessels.

A report by the Global Maritime Forum warned that labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, threatening the resilience of global supply chains.

Capt Stylianos Dimouleas, founder of Almi Tankers and a former seafarer, highlighted the pressures crews face during geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts.

Welfare and wellbeing, he said, must form part of management systems, adding that digital connectivity “is a right, not a benefit”.

He also noted that leadership and management training for senior officers helps strengthen safety culture across fleets.

The implications extend far beyond the ships themselves, particularly for countries with large maritime clusters.

Cyprus, one of the world’s top three ship-management hubs, relies heavily on internationally sourced seafarers to operate the vessels under its management.

According to the Chambers Global Practice Guide, Cyprus is the largest third-party ship-management centre in Europe.

More than 200 shipping-related companies are active on the island, employing around 55,000 seafarers worldwide. Recent financial data show ship-management revenues in Cyprus reached €978 million in the first half of 2025, with crew-related costs accounting for 66 per cent of total expenses, emphasising the industry’s dependence on an increasingly strained global workforce.

For Cyprus, whose maritime priorities will feature prominently during its EU Council Presidency in 2026, the growing labour drain at sea intersects directly with the sector’s decarbonisation and safety objectives.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.

Taken together, the accelerating exodus from seafaring, the widening training gap and the rise in abandonment cases demonstrate a sector under significant stress at a critical moment.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:10.035187

Looking ahead The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver.","A key global decarbonization milestone for maritime shipping has been postponed. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted during its October meeting to defer, opens new tab by one year a decision on the much-anticipated Net-Zero Framework, opens new tab, an industry-wide regulatory regime intended to require binding greenhouse-gas (GHG) standards and a global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping.

The delay leaves the shipping sector in regulatory limbo even as companies, investors, and insurers press ahead with net-zero goals. It also raises fresh questions for legal, commercial, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) teams about how to keep decarbonization strategies on track while expectations for formal regulation remain unsettled.

What the framework would have done

Although formal adoption has been pushed back, the framework previously negotiated by IMO member states remains a useful roadmap. Under the terms agreed in April 2025, the package would have introduced a dual system combining a fuel-intensity standard and a market-based compliance mechanism.

Ships of 5,000 gross tons and above, representing roughly 85% of global shipping emissions, would have been required to limit the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per unit of energy. Vessels exceeding that threshold would either purchase Remedial Units (RUs) or pay a carbon fee, while ships outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units (SUs) that could be banked or traded. Earlier drafts pegged the fees at about $100 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent for lower-tier breaches and $380 per ton for more severe noncompliance.

Revenues from those charges were slated to flow into a new IMO Net-Zero Fund, projected to raise $11–12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030. The fund would finance alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficiency retrofits, and capacity building assistance for developing and small-island states.

The rule’s first compliance period was expected to begin around 2027 or 2028, giving the industry a limited window to adapt before obligations formally took effect.

Impacts of the delayed vote

The one-year postponement carries significant implications for maritime stakeholders, affecting investment timelines, compliance planning, and ESG accountability.

Alternative-fuel initiatives such as ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen bunkering depend on a predictable regulatory environment to attract capital and scale infrastructure. Without clear long-term rules in place, financing and deployment are likely to slow as investors reassess the commercial case for cleaner fuels.

For companies that had already begun preparing for the IMO framework, whether through carbon pricing models, fuel switch strategies, or contract revisions, the pause introduces uncertainty rather than relief. The underlying legal and operational architecture remains essential, but the absence of a firm regulatory anchor means planning must now account for a wider range of potential outcomes.

At the same time, ESG and litigation risks persist. Many carriers and logistics providers have set voluntary net-zero targets, and those commitments remain subject to investor scrutiny regardless of regulatory delays. If tangible progress lags behind public pledges, companies may face allegations of greenwashing or misrepresentation, particularly as disclosure standards tighten across jurisdictions.

The delay also increases the likelihood of regional fragmentation. In the absence of a single global standard, jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United Kingdom are advancing their own maritime carbon pricing systems, and others may follow. The resulting patchwork could complicate compliance for global operators and create uneven cost structures until an international framework is ultimately adopted.

What maritime stakeholders can do now

While the IMO finalizes its approach, maritime companies, financiers, and legal advisers can treat this interim period as a strategic window to strengthen compliance foundations, enhance operational resilience, and position themselves for long-term advantage in the event global rules do take effect. Stakeholders should focus in on the following areas.

Fuel strategy and contract readiness

Maritime companies should assess each vessel’s fuel intensity baseline, modeling alternative fuel scenarios and incorporating carbon compliance provisions into charterparties, ship management contracts, and fuel supply agreements. Clear terms on emissions liability, audit rights, and cost allocation will be critical as carbon performance becomes a defining commercial metric.

At the same time, early investment in low-carbon fuel partnerships (e.g., green ammonia, methanol, bio-LNG) and infrastructure projects can help operators manage future price volatility, mitigate regulatory risk, and secure a competitive advantage as the industry moves toward decarbonization.

Data monitoring and verification systems

Effective decarbonization requires rigor. Firms should consider deploying or upgrading emissions monitoring systems, fuel consumption analytics, voyage optimization software, and third-party verification protocols. Transparency will be a major target for investor and litigation scrutiny.

Disclosure, governance, and ESG alignment

Board-level oversight of climate strategy now overlaps directly with compliance risk. Legal teams should ensure that emissions and other ESG disclosures reflect credible transition pathways. Misstatements or overly optimistic timelines may expose firms to fiduciary duty or securities law claims.

Scenario planning and carbon price readiness

Even absent formal regulation, companies should stress-test multiple carbon price trajectories, fuel availability timelines, and compliance cost impacts. Legal counsel should prepare for a scenario in which IMO pricing reemerges in 2026 at higher levels than initially projected. Risk mitigation strategies may include hedging, alternative fuel leases, or early vessel retirement strategies.

Regional regimes and supply chain exposure

Firms should continue monitoring regional regimes and the demands of supply chain actors for low-carbon shipping services. Legal teams should evaluate risks of indirect exposure through charters with cargo owners, scope 3 disclosure obligations, and contractual carveouts for non-compliant vessels.

Transition opportunities and ESG takeaways

Although the framework delay is a setback for regulatory clarity, it does not change the decarbonization direction: The maritime shipping industry’s emissions matter, and ESG stakeholders are watching. Companies that continue advancing their transition plans now will be better positioned to meet investor expectations, secure financing, and shape the rules once they arrive.

Early movers stand to gain a distinct advantage by investing in alternative fuel access, low-carbon vessels, and fuel contract strategies that appeal to cargo owners and financiers. Proactively upgrading monitoring systems, contracts, and fuel arrangements can also reduce future stranded-asset risk and potential litigation exposure.

Additionally, demonstrating measurable progress through credible data, retrofits, and low-carbon commitments can help build stakeholder confidence, reinforce ESG credibility, and keep companies aligned with net-zero targets even before formal regulation takes effect.

Looking ahead

The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver. Stakeholders should treat this period not as a pause but as a preparation phase. The next IMO session (expected around October 2026) will likely revisit the framework. When that happens, the baseline for compliance may shift, meaning strategic readiness today will be key to risk mitigation in the future.

Legal, finance, and operations teams should synchronize efforts now on modeling scenarios, negotiating contracts, mapping fuel supply access, strengthening disclosure and governance, and ramping up efficiency programs.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:16.188289

The pace of decarbonisation is being held back by the growing share in world GDP of emerging markets – which are far more carbon intensive – and recently by a slowdown in improvements in global energy efficiency.

With world GDP expected to grow by more than 2.5% a year in the next few years, the pace of decarbonisation would need to roughly double from recent rates to ensure that global carbon emissions start to fall.

The carbon intensity of GDP can be decomposed into the energy intensity of GDP (energy consumption/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (CO2/energy consumption). Most of the fall in CO2/GDP since the 1960s is because of falling energy intensity, but CO2/energy has been falling more quickly since 2010.

However, energy/GDP hardly fell last year as energy consumption growth rose to 2.8%. This reflected extreme weather, rapid growth in energy-intensive data centres related to the AI boom and a rebound in energy consumption in Europe as energy prices fell from earlier highs.

The rising share of emerging markets in world GDP is also constraining the global pace of decarbonisation. Emerging markets now account for all the growth in CO2 emissions. Developed market emissions have been falling steadily since 2007 and are now back to where they were in 1970.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:22.305841
