In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.
Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.
Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.
Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.","EcoLog has taken an important step in the development of a liquid hydrogen import terminal in the Port of Amsterdam.

This week, the company signed an agreement in Tokyo with a group of technology partners that will supply equipment for both the future import terminal and the vessels that will transport the hydrogen.

The consortium partners,Ebara Corporation, Fukui Seisakusho, Kobe Steel, and TB Global Technologies, will provide equipment and technical solutions for EcoLog’s liquid hydrogen vessels as well as for the planned import terminal in Amsterdam.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.

It will be the first terminal of this scal worldwide. The terminal is expected to become operational around 2030 and, in its initial phase, will have an annual throughput capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and 1.8 million tonnes of liquid CO₂.

Liquid hydrogen can be transported efficiently and safely via pipelines, inland shipping, rail, and road.

Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.

Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.

Both maritime transport and terminal operations require highly specialized equipment.

EcoLog has therefore entered into a framework agreement with its partners to jointly develop and integrate this equipment into the vessels and the terminal. This includes, among other things:

Pumps for loading and unloading liquid hydrogen

Safety relief valves to reduce tank pressure in emergency situations

Heat exchangers to convert liquid hydrogen into gaseous form, enabling onward transport via pipelines after arrival

Marine loading arms for the safe loading and unloading of vessels

Based on the current planning, the company is working towards realization of the terminal in 2030.

The import of green hydrogen is essential for the development of the European hydrogen economy and for the decarbonization of industry.

Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.

The development of the terminal in the Port of Amsterdam aligns with this international cooperation and with the broader ambition to supply North-West Europe with green hydrogen.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EL2501-S01A-PH1-250616.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:57:09.692176

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today launched a new inquiry into fuel smuggling and money laundering reportedly orchestrated by Mexican drug cartels, by requesting information from 7 shipping companies about their operations and safeguards against illegal fuel trafficking.

“Drug cartels are reportedly siphoning billions of dollars’ worth of fuel to bolster their criminal empires, while they also bring drugs and violence into the United States. I want to be sure both shipping companies and the U.S. government are doing everything in their power to shut off this revenue stream. These letters are the first step in my effort to learn more about how these criminal networks operate, and where existing controls are failing,” Wyden said.

News reports this year indicate that drug cartels have diverted billions of dollars in diesel and other fuel shipments to avoid Mexican customs and operate an illegal fuel network in Mexico. Those proceeds strengthen drug cartels, which are major manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs into the United States, with responsibility for murders and brutal violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Trump has diverted law enforcement officials and resources away from ongoing investigations in order to round up immigrants with little regard for due process or prioritizing truly dangerous criminals.

Wyden requested information from TORM, Teekay, Scorpio Tankers, NORDEN, International Seaways, Frontline and CMB.Tech.

“Cracking down on this illicit industry is critical to blunt cartels’ ability to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, cocaine, and other deadly drugs in the United States, and the international shipping industry must play its part to end this lawless practice,” Wyden wrote in his letters to the shippers.

This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.
""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""
Integrating green corridors into strategy This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy.","Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell has established what it calls the first operational green corridor for shipping between Brazil and Europe.

The initiative uses a certified sustainable biofuel to power vessels along a 5,000-nautical-mile supply route, signalling a major step in decarbonising deep-sea logistics networks.

Odfjell is currently running between 12 and 15 voyages each year on this transatlantic corridor with each round trip taking approximately 40 days.

This is not a one-off trial, but a sustained operational change to its service on this route. Odfjell has committed to self-funding the initiative covering the higher cost of the greener fuel without relying on subsidies.

Harald Fotland, Odfjell's Chief Executive Officer, says ""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation.""

Securing the biofuel supply chain

The green corridor relies on a B24 sustainable biofuel blend which consists of 24% renewable biodiesel from waste sources and 76% very-low-sulphur oil. To ensure a consistent and reliable supply for its vessels, Odfjell has secured a long-term offtake agreement for this B24 blend sourced from Rio Grande Brazil. This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.

Collaboration is central to the project’s design. The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working with Odfjell to enhance efficiency and streamline port-stay processes for vessels on this route.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains. ""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The project builds upon a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to create a green transatlantic shipping route.

From an industry perspective, the initiative is seen as a vital move toward decarbonising global logistics. According to the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, shipping is responsible for about 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Knut Arild Hareide, CEO of the association, explains ""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050.""

Integrating green corridors into strategy

This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy. Odfjell has already achieved a carbon intensity reduction of more than 54% against its 2008 baseline, through a series of technical and operational improvements to its fleet.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says. The project aligns with the International Maritime Organization's 2030 targets and the European Union's Fit for 55 package.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime, noted that biofuels offer a pragmatic solution for the deep-sea shipping sector. ""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" Knut says.

The success of the supply chain will hinge on ongoing work with ports customers and fuel suppliers. Harald believes this will help to increase the availability of green fuels and maximise operational efficiency. Harald concludes: ""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start.""

Through these deployments, the two winning shipping lines, Hapag-Lloyd and NCL, are redefining what’s possible in this industry:

Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships, on a trans-oceanic lane.

NCL will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership, serving a northern European trade lane.

Both fuels will be made with low-carbon hydrogen produced with renewable energy and will deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis relative to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045. We are very grateful for the trust that all ZEMBA members have placed in our capabilities, and we remain fully committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a greener future for global shipping,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

“We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics,” said Bente Hetland, CEO of NCL. “With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels. We are truly grateful for the strong support from the business community as we work together to deliver efficient and forward-thinking transport solutions.”

Following ZEMBA’s novel inaugural tender in 2024, ZEMBA’s second procurement focused on kickstarting a new market for scalable, low-carbon hydrogen-derived e-fuels that will be essential to achieve an economically viable whole-of-sector maritime clean energy transition.

Just as global renewable energy costs have declined significantly in recent years as the market has matured, e-methanol and e-ammonia that are produced with clean energy offer great potential for economies of scale. With this announcement, ZEMBA’s first-mover members are demonstrating support for scalable, strategic, and holistic supply chain sustainability solutions that can enable them to meet long-term goals.

This latest announcement also reinforces the importance of credible, third-party verified, and transparent book and claim chain of custody systems to activate early voluntary corporate demand and create markets for new technology solutions.

For highly distributed global sectors like ocean transportation, these systems enable demand from buyers around the world to flow to first-mover suppliers that are ready for deployment, irrespective of geographic availability constraints that would otherwise render such commercial arrangements impossible.

Ofiniti, the company behind the FuelBoss digital delivery platform and BunkerFlow, recently said it has completed more than 24,000 digital bunker operations across its network this year.

In its Impact Report 2025, Ofiniti said 2025 was the year digitalisation and decarbonisation truly converged in bunkering.

“Alternative fuels are moving from pilot stage to scaled supply, biofuels, LNG, methanol, ammonia, but they bring complexity, documentation demands and safety requirements that manual processes cannot handle,” the company said.

“That is where Ofiniti quietly became infrastructure. Before electronic Bunker Delivery Notes were mandated in Singapore or widely discussed across the industry, we had already begun digitising operations in North-West Europe.

“What is now becoming a global expectation began as a practical response to operational friction, making documentation clearer, aligning stakeholders, and reducing manual burden.”

With Ofiniti’s capability to support LNG, methanol, biofuels and ammonia, the company said its suppliers delivered 500,000 metric tonnes (mt) of alternative marine fuels, equivalent to filling 200 Olympic pools, this year.

Ofiniti also said its first deliveries of 100% bio-LNG and B100 UCOME were also completed and documented digitally in 2025.

With alternative fuels, the company said the stack of documents grows with more comprehensive checklists and documentation of the lifecycle emission profile and FuelBoss can automate that process.

“It standardises the process, gives every stakeholder the same data, and creates the digital custody chain required to validate the sustainability of new fuels,” it added.

With that, Ofiniti has reduced paperwork by an average of 28 pages per LNG delivery.

Looking ahead, Tue Nielsen, CEO of Ofiniti, said: “The next phase of the energy transition is not only about new fuel molecules; it is about proof, integrity, safety, and interoperability.

“Ofiniti is positioned as the system that enables these flows, the unseen operating layer that lets the energy transition actually work at scale.”

Singapore-based maritime electrification startup Pyxis on Wednesday (17 December) said it has secured SGD 13 million (USD 10 million) in the first close of its SGD 18 million growth funding round.

The early close underscores rising investor conviction in Pyxis’ technology and commercial progress, reinforced by continued support from Singapore government agencies such as the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and SEEDS, which operates under SG Growth Capital, the investment platform of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore Pyxis’ fund raise comes at a time marked by an increased demand for electric vessels across Asia.

The region operates more than 70,000 coastal and in-port vessels while Singapore alone expects some 1,600 harbour crafts to transition to electric or low-carbon alternatives as part of the broader national goals.

Pyxis’ electric vessels and energy systems address this need directly – reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) by lowering both fuel and maintenance expenses, while significantly improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions.

Powered by Electra™, the company’s proprietary energy and vessel management platform, Pyxis enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and fleet-level optimisation, improved reliability and reduced downtime.

To date, the company has secured 17 orders for electric vessels across multiple customers in the region, including Singapore. Concurrently, Pyxis is developing a network of ultra-fast marine charging sites, with two charging locations deployed and additional sites planned in partnership with local stakeholders. An upcoming 300KW charger location will also be launched in Q1 2026. With these deployments, Pyxis is entering its strongest growth chapter since inception.

The financing round is backed by a strong coalition of climate-tech, venture capital, and maritime strategic investors, with follow-on commitments from Shift4Good, Motion Ventures, the world’s largest maritime tech fund, and SG Growth Capital, underscoring the sustained confidence of Pyxis’ long-term partners. It also includes participation from strategic backers including Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, one of the world’s largest shipping companies, through its corporate venture capital arm, MOL PLUS.

The raise was catalysed by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)’s Expression of Interest (EOI) for electric vessel financing, which was part of Singapore’s broader maritime decarbonisation and innovation efforts to build an electric harbour craft ecosystem that supports early adopters of new electric solutions.

In addition to equity financing, Pyxis has secured green debt financing from OCBC, strengthening its capacity to scale vessel deployment and infrastructure development. This financing, to be channelled toward vessel capital expenditure, will provide capital flexibility essential for accelerating commercial rollout.

“Investor conviction in this round sends an unmistakable message: maritime electrification is accelerating, and Pyxis is leading that transition,” said Tommy Phun, Founder and CEO of Pyxis.

“The strength of this first close, anchored by strategic follow-on investments, validates the scalability of our technology and our ambition to build Asia’s leading coastal electrification ecosystem.”

“Two years ago, Pyxis was a bold vision with a great team behind it. Today, that vision is moving fast across the water: 17 vessels secured, charging infrastructure rolling out, Electra™ evolving into a true operating system for electric fleets, and international expansion underway,” said Sebastien Guillard, Co-founder and Managing Partner of Shift4Good.

“Few companies execute with this clarity and pace. We’re proud to back Pyxis again and support their rise as the leader of Asia’s coastal electrification wave.”

“SEEDS is proud to continue backing Pyxis, a fast-growing company with a capable team and strong strategic partnerships, together with our co-investment partner Shift4Good. We look forward to seeing Pyxis advance its solutions and contribute to the maritime electrification landscape in the region,” said Tan Kaixin, General Manager of SEEDS.

The Norwegian chemical tanker operator is running 12 to 15 voyages annually along the route, each lasting around 40 days, using a B24 sustainable biofuel blend sourced from Rio Grande.

The initiative is entirely self-funded, with Odfjell covering the additional fuel costs without subsidies or external financial support.

""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation,"" says Harald Fotland, the company's CEO.

The B24 blend comprises 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% very-low-sulphur oil.

How the green corridor works

Odfjell has secured an offtake agreement for the B24 blend in Rio Grande to ensure long-term fuel availability.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are collaborating with Odfjell to improve efficiency and optimise port-stay processes along the corridor.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains.

""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

The company emphasised this represents a sustained operational commitment rather than a one-off demonstration project.

A well supported initiative

The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, welcomed the initiative as an important milestone.

""We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions,"" he says.

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The corridor builds on a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to establish a green transatlantic shipping route.

Knut Arild Hareide, who is CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, sees the launch as a highly encouraging step towards greener logistics.

""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050,"" Knut explains.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Odfjell's broader decarbonisation strategy

Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to a 2008 benchmark through various technical and operational measures.

The biofuel corridor represents an additional element in the company's decarbonisation approach.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says.

This enables us to accelerate the development of emission-free vessels in operation, whilst also ensuring ship operators and cargo owners staying ahead of increasingly strict emissions”, says Oestvik.

Zero-emission shipping

LH2 Shipping has been developing ship concepts for many years and is now stepping up its activities and is currently developing a wide range of zero-emission ship concepts. This creates both a market for LH₂ production and shows that zero-emission maritime transport is both possible and profitable in the long term. These projects are groundbreaking and will accelerate the transition to carbon-free maritime transport – without compromising good operations or safety, while the ships offer range at

sea.

Shortsea shipping has extended experience in the combination of fuel cells and batteries, where the two technologies are working together in hybrid systems where different routes and ship types provides different system combinations. Some routes can be operated 100% on batteries whereas hydrogen driven fuel cells are added where range and charging issues are dominant.

At the workshop, delegates discussed the overall trend of green methanol and Vietnam’s opportunities in the global value chain. The workshop marked an important step forward in efforts to promote the development of low-carbon fuels in Vietnam.

Green methanol trend in the world

In the context of more than 150 countries committing to Net Zero by 2050-2060, the demand for low-carbon fuels has increased sharply on a global scale. The maritime industry is particularly notable as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce emissions by 70% by 2040, leading to an explosion of methanol-powered fleets – expected to double by 2026. Methanol fuel infrastructure at major ports in Asia is developing rapidly. Vietnam is located on a key China – Southeast Asia shipping route, opening up great opportunities to join the green methanol supply chain.

As a pillar energy group of the country, Petrovietnam has identified the energy transition strategy as the central priority. The Group is implementing low-carbon energy development models: green hydrogen, green ammonia, biofuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biomethanol and carbon recovery, use and storage solutions (CCUS); while expanding the clean energy ecosystem and value chain of biomass, agricultural byproducts to meet the requirements of emission reduction. This is a key orientation to contribute to the realization of Vietnam’s Net Zero 2050 goal.

Petrovietnam – BASF Cooperation: Creating a foundation for the green methanol industry in Vietnam

At the program, Petrovietnam and BASF shared the orientation of cooperation in researching and developing green methanol on the basis of taking advantage of the abundant biomass resources, especially in the Mekong Delta, along with Petrovietnam’s complete oil and gas – chemical infrastructure. BASF brings leading technology expertise, global experience in the methanol value chain and in-depth understanding of international carbon policies and standards.

The sustainable development strategy of Ca Mau Fertilizer (PVCFC) focuses on integrating ESG (Environment, Society and Governance) factors, focusing on farmers, building a digital agricultural ecosystem and optimizing resources (air), towards the goal of green growth, improving competitiveness, and bringing benefits to the community.

In 2024, the enterprise reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.45%, energy consumption intensity by 5.48%, and water use by 2.02% compared to 2023, and in the 2023-2025 period, the unit planted more than 300,000 trees to restore ecology. In particular, the initiative to reuse CO2 to produce food CO2 has made Ca Mau Fertilizer one of the first enterprises in the industry to orient the development of a circular economic model, reduce emissions, optimize resources and increase product value. At the same time, the company develops Urea bio, microbiotics, organic and mineral products, aiming to balance inorganic and organic, improve soil, protect water resources, and contribute to building a green agricultural sector.

The proactive participation of PVCFC in this dialogue demonstrates the role of domestic enterprises ready to contribute practical expertise, operational data, market understanding and ESG vision – all towards the common goal of sustainable development and Net Zero 2050.

Policy gaps and the need to improve the legal framework

Experts from the Institute of Energy (Ministry of Industry and Trade), universities and businesses point out that Vietnam currently lacks a clear legal framework for low-carbon fuels such as methanol, ammonia, green hydrogen; especially fuel quality standards, product life cycle assessments (LCA), price mechanisms, financial incentives and carbon markets.

The completion of these policies will facilitate Vietnam’s participation in the regional green methanol value chain, while reducing trade risks in the context of international mechanisms such as the European Southern Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM EU) gradually being widely applied.

Green methanol is not only a new product, but a strategic foundation for Vietnam’s energy and low-carbon chemicals industry. With rich Biomass resources, favorable geographical location, available industrial infrastructure and a strong determination to shift energy, Vietnam is fully qualified to become a new green methanol center of Asia.

Infographic: Polar Fuels Can Reduce the Impact of Black Carbon on the Arctic

The Clean Arctic Alliance welcomes the submission of a proposal (PPR 13-6-1) to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that aims to establish a fuel measure under MARPOL Annex VI that would reduce the impact of black carbon emissions from international shipping on the Arctic.

The proposal to establish an Arctic fuel measure has been submitted by four IMO member states to a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13), which will take place in February 2026. Regulation of fuels suitable for use in the Arctic means moving to cleaner marine fuels which emit less black carbon, and thus contribute less to Arctic warming. The geographical area to which a proposal would be relevant remains to be determined.

Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance said:

“The Clean Arctic Alliance welcomes the proposal for an Arctic fuel measure which, if agreed upon during February’s IMO meeting, will have positive benefits for both the Arctic and the global climate, as well as provide positive health benefits for Arctic communities. It is important that other Arctic and climate-vulnerable states step up to support the proposal during the discussions at PPR 13 – action to reduce emissions of super-pollutant black carbon is essential for remaining in line with the Paris climate targets and will be an important first step towards reducing international shipping’s climate impact.”

Global container line Hapag-Lloyd and regional operator North Sea Container Line won ZEMBA’s second tender, announced Wednesday, enabling member companies to reduce ocean transport emissions through scalable alternative fuels.

According to ZEMBA, the deployment will cover an initial 20 billion tonne nautical miles of transport activity over three years, with some members extending to five years, resulting in at least approximately 120,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abated starting in 2027. Member companies participating in the initiative include Amazon, Patagonia, Tchibo, Beiersdorf, Brooks Running, IKEA, Nike, and others.

Under the arrangement, Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships operating on trans-oceanic lanes, while North Sea Container Line will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership serving a northern European trade lane. Both fuels will be produced using low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy sources and are designed to deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

The award comes just days after Hapag-Lloyd ordered eight dual-fuel methanol containerships at Chinese shipbuilder CIMC Raffles to in a deal valued at more than USD 500 million, marking the company’s first newbuild project utilizing the fuel. The 4,500 TEU vessels are scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029, and will feature state-of-the-art dual-fuel methanol engines capable of achieving up to 30 percent greater efficiency than older ships in the same size class. When operating on methanol propulsion, the fleet is expected to save up to 350,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.

Hapag-Lloyd’s current fleet includes 37 dual-fuel LNG ships either in operation or planned, with the ability to also run on biomethane.

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

Bente Hetland, CEO of North Sea Container Line, expressed similar commitment. “We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics. With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels.”

This second procurement follows ZEMBA’s inaugural tender in 2024, which focused on waste-based biomethane and was also awarded to Hapag-Lloyd. The latest tender specifically targets hydrogen-derived e-fuels to kickstart a new market for scalable, low-carbon alternatives essential for achieving an economically viable maritime clean energy transition.

The announcement reinforces the role of credible, third-party verified book and claim chain of custody systems in activating early voluntary corporate demand for new technology solutions. ZEMBA continues its partnership with Katalist, the first nonprofit maritime book and claim system, to enable demand from buyers worldwide to flow to suppliers ready for deployment regardless of geographic constraints.

ZEMBA, which serves as a first-of-its-kind buyers group within the maritime sector, aims to accelerate commercial deployment of clean energy-powered shipping and enable economies of scale beyond what individual freight buyers could accomplish alone. The Aspen Institute Energy and Environment Program serves as the ZEMBA secretariat, with technical and legal support provided by the Center for Green Market Activation, Lloyd’s Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub, and law firm Pillsbury.

The alliance expects to finalize the full measurable impact of its second tender in 2026 as existing and new members complete contracting with the winning carriers.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFIF.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 12:57:13.902628

Located in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, this project is one of the earliest large-scale initiatives in China to achieve a closed-loop chain spanning from biomass waste to green methanol and then to shipping fuel.

The first phase of this project has an annual production capacity of 50,000 tons of green methanol. It boasts advantages such as strong raw material adaptability, significant operational flexibility, high process integration, and significant carbon reduction at both source and process levels. The product achieves over an 85% reduction in GHG emissions throughout its entire lifecycle.

“CIMC Enric’s methanol plant in Zhanjiang precisely targets the IMO’s 2050 net-zero emissions goal. It deeply aligns with the core demand for decarbonization and emission reduction in the global shipping industry,” said the company.

The project leverages the core advantages of being backed by the Zhanjiang Port and the abundant biomass feedstock resources locally. Downstream, it can serve key domestic markets such as the Greater Bay Area, as well as international port markets like the port of Singapore or other major global ports.

Gao Xiang, CIMC Group president and CIMC Enric chairman, said, “the official launch of CIMC Enric’s green methanol plant, amid high expectations across the industry, marks not only a milestone for the company but also signals that South China has emerged as a rising star in the global green shipping sector.”

It will continue to supply green methanol fuel that meets the highest international shipping standards to global markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and Europe..

Yang Xiaohu, CIMC president, stated that the completion and operation of the project marks a solid step forward in the large-scale and commercial application of biomass energy.

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority.
“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.
While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.
“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.","This is part of the COMMODITIES 2026 series, where our reporters bring you key themes that will drive commodities markets in 2026.

Tightening EU rules on greenhouse gas emissions are expected to prompt demand for alternative marine energy, but European suppliers are not necessarily well-positioned to harness the additional requirements due to a complex regulatory landscape.

The EU’s FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy’s GHG intensity have been in force since January 2025, and Brussels will increase the coverage ratio of maritime emissions from 70% in 2025 to 100% in 2026 under its Emissions Trading System, while also including methane and nitrous oxide in emissions accounting.

Many shipping and bunker industry participants expect shipping companies to consume more LNG and biofuels for compliance requirements, and that their bunkering points will be driven by pricing and logistical needs.

The two fuels are more available than other forms of energy with lower GHG emissions than conventional oil-based fuels, and Albrecht Grell, managing director of consultancy OceanScore, said their popularity will only grow due to increased financial incentives.

Average delivered bunker costs in Rotterdam were $18.3/Gigajoule for LNG, $19/Gj for 0.1%-sulfur marine gasoil and $22.8/Gj for B30 bioblend with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in intra-EU trades over January-November, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab), when the ETS was taken into consideration.

If the 2026 rules were to apply, MGO — the preferred compliance option among conventional fuels in EU waters due to sulfur limits — would be priced at a wide premium to LNG of $1/Gj assuming the ship has a slow-speed, two-stroke engine and a narrower discount to B30 of $3.3/Gj.

“We see an increasing uptake [of the fuels] throughout this year,” Grell told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy. “The increased commercial benefit will help to further support this trend.”

Globally, classification society DNV expects LNG demand from the shipping sector to grow from 906 petajoules in 2024 to 1,032 Pj in 2025 and 1,196 Pj in 2026, and biomass demand to increase from 52.5 Pj in 2024 to 80.4 Pj in 2025 and 115 Pj in 2026.

LNG

Europe’s LNG bunker market has seen strong activity through 2025, buoyed by calmer sentiment in the wider LNG complex, keeping prices competitive aside from FuelEU Maritime.

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority. Volumes were up by 34% from the second quarter and by almost 23% from Q3 2024.

“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.

Despite methane slip worries concerning LNG-powered ships, Bunker Holding’s head of LNG, Edward Glossop, said the inclusion of methane in the ETS accounting from 2026 is “no game changer” for LNG bunkering’s business case.

Total fuel and compliance costs for the worst environmentally performing ship with a four-stroke LNG-fueled engine would still be $120-$150/metric ton lower than one burning MGO in intra-EU trades, according to Glossop’s estimates made when applying the 2026 rules to early-December fuel prices.

“Global LNG supply is of course increasing rapidly, and all forward curves suggest that prices will be even more competitive for the coming years,” said Glossop, adding that the forecast LNG barge tightness has yet to manifest in Europe.

Meanwhile, market participants said bio-LNG bunker demand has also been on the rise, and burning the low-carbon fuel could generate large quantities of FuelEU Maritime surplus units, which could be sold to other shipping companies via a pooling arrangement. Gas supplier Gasum quoted the surplus unit at Eur233/mtCO2e ($270/mtCO2e) on Dec. 15.

While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.

Low-carbon energy

Conventional ships can only burn biofuels to meet EU compliance requirements, often on a drop-in basis. Bunker trader KPI OceanConnect estimates FuelEU Maritime alone has led to a gain of 600,000-700,000 mt/y in biobunker demand on a B100 basis.

“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.

But Europe’s biobunker markets are facing a shake-up, with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III transposed into national laws across member states.

The Netherlands, home to the largest European biobunkering port, Rotterdam, is set to implement an Emission Reduction Units system as part of RED III from Jan. 1, 2026, with regulatory designs that, traders said, could drive up marine biofuel prices.

Further complicating the matter is that Belgium and the Netherlands have planned together to treat UCOME, the most popular feedstock in biobunker fuels, as a fossil fuel under their RED III implementation, but Belgium’s transposition date has not been fully confirmed. In Germany, the international shipping sector is excluded from RED III.

“Predicting what effect RED III will have on the market is tricky,” said Jesper Lindegaard Sorensen, global head of alternative fuels at KPI OceanConnect. “We will have to wait and see.”

Singapore has overtaken Rotterdam as the world’s largest biobunkering hub with its ability to offer more lower prices to container lines in Asia-Europe trades, and Sorensen said the world’s largest bunker port is “the obvious candidate” to take more volumes should Rotterdam’s competitiveness be eroded.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for B30 with 30% UCOME and 70% very low sulfur fuel oil was $709/mt in Singapore in November, and $756/mt in Rotterdam, according to Platts assessments.

For intra-EU trades, other bunker traders said the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region will remain a top biobunkering center due to a well-established logistics network that allows suppliers to offer grades up to B100, but ports in Spain, Italy, France and Turkey are also increasing their capabilities.

“Other locations are setting up a biofuel supply chain … we will be more diverse,” Cardullo said.

Among other fuels, a growing number of ships that can run on green methanol are hitting the waters, but shipping professionals said their uptake remains constrained by high prices and limited availability.

Shipbroker Braemar estimated 87 methanol-capable ships were in operation as of Dec. 10, while at least another 300 are due for delivery in the coming years.

Meanwhile, green methanol costs three times more than MGO, and its production currently stands at 2.2 million mt/y compared with the 60 million mt/y projected to be required by 2040, according to MPC Containerships.",,N,,2025-12-17 02:57:04.347705
