Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box.
If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors … Di Gilpin noted.
“One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.
Bottom line The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea.","Wind propulsion is moving from novelty to considered climate solution, but its wider adoption hinges on clearer rules, trusted performance data, and joined-up commercial models, industry leaders told a MarRI-UK webinar on “Wind Propulsion Technology & the Maritime Market.”

Hosted by MarRI-UK and chaired by John Hudson, the session brought together Diane (Di) Gilpin, founder and CEO of Smart Green Shipping (SGS), Frank Hendrikse, Manager, Tanker department, Norway, Hagland Shipbrokers, and Camille Bourgeon of the IMO’s environment division. The conversation ranged from the practical, crew reaction and retrofit challenges, to regulatory and financing obstacles, and returned repeatedly to the need for robust, standardized performance measurement.

Regulatory uncertainty and the NZF pause

Speakers agreed that the recent delay to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) have added uncertainty that complicates investment decisions across the sector.

The extraordinary session of the marine environment protection committee was adjourned for a period of one year in October. Work continues in the meantime, but the market has uncertainty

… Bourgeon stressed, but acknowledged the impact of the adjournment.

Panelists warned that fragmented regional rules could damage the global market unless a global IMO framework resumes. Frank Hendrikse argued that worldwide regulation remains “critically important for an international industry” and urged a return to global consensus so that owners and financiers can plan with confidence.

The MEPC outcome is unfortunate, and the worst-case scenario is that regional markets and countries start having their own rules and restrictions. World shipping is a global business, so IMO regulations are very important. We sincerely hope this is only a short delay and that we can continue our work.

… said Frank Hendrikse.

Where wind fits in the metrics debate

One focal point was how wind propulsion should be treated within the IMO’s emerging greenhouse gas metrics, especially the Global Fuel Indicator (GFI) being developed under the NZF.

Bourgeon said the GFI workstream is “the right vehicle” to accommodate wind technologies, but that technical discussions are still needed to ensure the metric is technology-neutral and properly reflects wind’s contribution.

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box. “Wind is an energy source in its own right,” she said, noting that classifying it only as efficiency can reduce investor appetite.

If you talk about energy efficiency, there’s a lower level of appetite. If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors

… Di Gilpin noted.

Panelists also encouraged technical work on life-cycle assessment (LCA) and urged industry stakeholders to engage in the ongoing GFI and LCA guideline development so wind solutions are measured consistently and credibly.

Data, validation and the trust barrier

A recurring theme was the need for independent, standardized validation to counter past over-claiming about fuel savings. “One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.

Di Gilpin described SGS’s approach: developing digital twins and using ITTC-aligned sea trials to validate predictive models. “We can guarantee fuel-saving performance through our prediction tools,” she said, adding that validated models make it possible to underwrite leases and performance guarantees, a commercial arrangement SGS favors because it transfers lifetime risk away from shipowners.

Bourgeon noted IMO work to improve measurement guidance and called for more “exchange of experience” and willingness to share granular performance data so regulators, owners, and charterers can build confidence.

Segments, retrofits and crew acceptance

Speakers said wind technologies are being trialed across many sectors, but that uptake varies by segment and vessel design. Hendrikse suggested tankers and smaller dry cargo ships, where deck space and cargo operations are more flexible, may be early candidates, while large containerships pose tougher packaging challenges. “Container ships are more challenging,” he said, though feeder vessels and kites have been trialed.

The panel also contrasted retrofit versus newbuild approaches. Retrofitting is constrained by existing ship geometries and stability limits, Hendrikse observed, whereas newbuild designs can optimize hull form, superstructure, and engine sizing around sails or rotors, potentially lowering the incremental cost of wind systems.

On human factors, the webinar found skepticism often gives way to enthusiasm once crews see the systems in action. Gilpin recounted trials aboard a chartered ship, the Pacific Gribb, where initial reluctance turned to engagement within an hour of raising a wing.

Speakers recommended integrating wind-system scenarios into bridge simulators and flagging the forthcoming STCW training review as an opportunity to fold wind-propulsion competence into seafarer standards.

Financing, business models and standardization

Panelists stressed that policy and finance levers can accelerate adoption. Participants pointed to several enablers: a clear, internationally harmonized regulatory framework, standardized performance metrics (an IMO priority), and financing structures that align costs and benefits across owners, charterers, and cargo buyers.

Gilpin and Hendrikse both emphasized the importance of champions, offtakers, or investors willing to underwrite early projects, and practical contracting solutions that allocate risk and reward. Di described SGS’s leasing model, which keeps lifetime and maintenance risk off owners’ balance sheets, helping bridge the gap between early prototypes and commercial maturity.

Bourgeon highlighted IMO’s ongoing work on performance standardization for wind propulsion technologies and encouraged stakeholders to engage in technical discussions to ensure new tools and metrics reflect operational realities.

Bottom line

The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea. A growing pipeline of pilots, validated modeling tools, and engaged cargo owners is shifting wind into the realistic innovation category.

But panelists were clear that progress requires aligned metrics, transparent validation, and financing mechanisms that share risk across the value chain.

Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction.

Conclusion Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time.","THE recent failure to secure agreement on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has created renewed uncertainty for shipowners at a moment when long-term clarity is needed. A global path was expected to guide investment decisions and support consistent planning. Without it, there is a heightened risk that shipowners may face rising costs as they attempt to comply with a complicated and still developing mix of national and regional measures.

In the absence of a unified approach, regions are pressing ahead with their own initiatives, each designed to address emissions in ways that reflect local priorities. Europe is already far advanced with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, while regulatory ideas are gaining momentum in Asia and Africa.

Although these initiatives share the intention of reducing emissions, they differ in scope, data requirements and cost structures. Shipowners trading across multiple areas must therefore prepare for obligations that may vary depending on where their vessels operate.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important. The introduction of European measures highlighted how easily unplanned exposure can arise. Operators that call at European ports for only part of the year found that even short visits carried consequences they had not anticipated. With other regions exploring their own approaches, the challenge of forecasting how operational patterns influence compliance costs is becoming a central concern for owners.

Alongside regulatory questions, owners must assess which technological paths offer practical progress. LNG continues to be the preferred option for many newbuildings due to its maturity and established infrastructure. Methanol is attracting attention for retrofits, offering a more straightforward transition from traditional liquid fuels. Ammonia is also being explored, particularly for merchant vessels, although handling and safety considerations remain significant factors.

Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction. Improvements in hydrodynamic design, propulsion systems and energy utilisation are already delivering measurable gains. Waste heat recovery, once mainly associated with newbuildings, is now being applied more widely to existing vessels. Battery systems and shore power connections are also becoming more common, providing options for reducing consumption without depending on future fuel availability.

A stronger partnership offering shipowners more than the sum of its parts

The passenger and cruise sectors have been early adopters of many energy efficiency and retrofit solutions. These ships present unique engineering challenges because of their dense machinery layouts and significant hotel loads. Foreship’s extensive experience in this segment, developed through thousands of projects, has produced practical insights that are increasingly valuable across the wider maritime industry. Lessons learnt from integrating new systems into constrained spaces and maintaining operational continuity translate directly to other vessel types.

RINA’s acquisition of Foreship has brought together deep expertise in the passenger and cruise sectors with comprehensive capabilities. This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements. As regulation continues to evolve, the combined organisation offers shipowners practical engineering insight helping them assess their options with greater confidence at a time when environmental rules are shifting and compliance pathways are still taking shape.

Conclusion

Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time. Until then, owners must navigate a landscape that is still forming, shaped by regional initiatives and advancing technologies. Realistic, integrated guidance will be essential. By drawing on the combined strengths of RINA and Foreship, shipowners gain a more reliable foundation to manage uncertainty and prepare their fleets for a lower-carbon future.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/sponsored-content/2025-rina/marine-1-download-copy.png?rev=92c5eb6129574a54b616e9ee7d744ba5,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:14.880885

The shipments range from 17 antelopes, a rescued baboon, and 37 tons of art to a helmet that Michael Schumacher signed that same year

Singapore, December 8, 2025 – Parcels, planeloads, and packed shipping containers are what people typically associate with DHL Group, the world’s leading logistics provider. However, this only scratches the surface of what the company delivers throughout the year. Here are just five of the most extraordinary shipments the global market leader in logistics handled in 2025

151 Bear Sculptures on a Journey from Germany to Singapore

When art goes on tour: In June 2025, 151 life-sized bear sculptures embarked on a journey of about 10,000 kilometers from Wustermark near Berlin to Singapore. Crafted from weather-resistant fiberglass, each sculpture stands about two meters tall. Known as the “United Buddy Bears”, this colorful art project was launched in Berlin in 2002 to spread a message of peace and tolerance. Every bear is painted by an artist from a different country, symbolizing that nation’s culture and identity. DHL oversaw the secure transport of these valuable artworks. Weighing a total of 37 tons, the shipment was packed into eight sea containers, loaded by crane onto trucks, and transported to the Port of Hamburg. From there, the bears began their sea voyage to Singapore, where they were displayed for two months, continuing their mission of promoting international understanding.

USA to Kenya – Rare Antelopes Go Home

13,000 kilometers for survival: In February 2025, DHL transported 17 mountain bongo antelopes from a conservation center in Loxahatchee, Florida, to a wildlife sanctuary on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa’s second-highest peak. These animals are descendants of mountain bongos relocated from Kenya in the 1970s. Today, after decades of poaching, habitat loss, and forest degradation, the species is critically endangered, with fewer than 100 surviving in the wild. To ensure the Florida bongos’ safety and comfort on their journey, DHL provided a dedicated flight equipped with custom-built crates supplied by a wildlife protection organization. The animals received continuous care from a veterinarian and two bongo specialists. Their new sanctuary offers a secure environment where they can breed and thrive. Their offspring will one day return to the wild, reclaiming Mount Kenya’s forests as their natural home.

Across Continents, Signed by Legends – A Far-Traveled Helmet Meets Michael Schumacher

From Switzerland to Brazil, a helmet like no other embarked on a tour across continents in March 2025. On its journey, the helmet was signed by all 20 living Formula 1® world champions, becoming a unique piece of motorsport history. One signature was particularly moving: Michael Schumacher’s, the seven-time world champion who has withdrawn from public life since his severe skiing accident in 2013. His wife, Corinna, helped guide his hand to write his initials, “M.S.”, on the helmet – a gesture that resonated deeply with fans around the world. A replica of the helmet was later featured as a raffle prize to help fund the “Race Against Dementia” charity. Founded by three-time Formula 1® champion Sir Jackie Stewart, the organization funds research into prevention and treatments for dementia – a cause close to his heart after his wife’s diagnosis. Under strict security measures, DHL transported the helmet from Switzerland to the homes of multiple champions so they could add their signatures. The route included stops in Ibiza in Spain, London in the UK, and Brasília in Brazil.

Saving Saadoon – A Young Baboon Moves from the Middle East to East Africa

An unusual passenger boarded a DHL flight from Bahrain to Djibouti, East Africa, in November 2025 – Saadoon, a young male baboon. He was found abandoned and in critical condition in Bahrain in 2024, at just three months old, in a country where baboons are not native. Saadoon was a victim of illegal wildlife trade. After more than a year of intensive care by an animal welfare organization, he needed an environment suited to his species. Djibouti’s climate and ecosystem offered exactly that. DHL flew Saadoon from Muharraq in Bahrain to Djibouti airport, where he was transferred to a specialized refuge near Djibouti City. Custom boxes, veterinary oversight, and an accompanying animal welfare representative minimized stress during the flight. Now living in a sanctuary tailored to his needs, Saadoon shares a new home with a female baboon, essential for social bonding among these intelligent primates. His new surroundings give him a chance to adapt and, hopefully, live freely one day.

Paraguay to Peru – South America’s Iconic Club Football Trophy on the Move

In November 2025, DHL delivered the iconic trophy for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Final, South America’s most prestigious club football showdown. The journey began at CONMEBOL’s headquarters in Luque, Paraguay, and ended in Lima, Peru, where the decisive match took place on November 29. Standing alongside Europe’s UEFA Champions League, the CONMEBOL Libertadores brings together the best clubs from across South America, each chasing the ultimate prize and the privilege to represent the continent at the FIFA Club World Cup. Known for its electrifying atmosphere and passionate fans, the final is a sports highlight watched by millions worldwide. As CONMEBOL’s Official Logistics Partner, DHL ensured the trophy’s safe and timely arrival. Roughly one meter in height, it traveled in a custom metallic case with a special security lock and was handled exclusively with gloves to preserve its flawless shine. Even sealed inside the case, the trophy sparked excitement – fans who spotted it often gathered to snap photos and share the moment. This year, Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro claimed the trophy after an unforgettable all-Brazilian clash against Palmeiras of São Paulo.

The Green Pioneer was named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025.

The conversion journey of its diesel-electric power system to dual-fuel ammonia started in 2022, on land, when Fortescue converted a four-stroke Cummins engine at is Perth testing facility in Western Australia.

“The Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that safe, technical solutions for ammonia power engines exist” said Dr. Andrew Forrest, the Chairman of Fortescue back in 2024, and he has continued to push for “real zero” fossil-free operations on land and at sea.

Fortescue Shipping owns a fleet of eight conventionally powered Singapore-flagged very large ore carries as well as the Green Pioneer. Fortescue plans to retrofit all of its own ships with ammonia engines by 2030 and any newbuilds will feature ammonia engines.

Fortescue also charters in ships which contribute to the group’s Scope 3 emissions, the Net Zero target for which is 2040.

Fortescue has also developed a decarbonized mining approach. By 2030, the company’s mines will feature battery electric trucks, excavators and drills, autonomous vehicles, fast battery chargers for mobile mine equipment, and ore processing powered by wind and solar, supported by battery energy storage systems.

The company’s Green Metal project will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology to produce low emissions metal suitable for most global steel plants. Shipping semi-processed metal instead of the ore will also reduce shipping volumes with a consequential reduction on shipping emissions, supporting the company’s aim to reduce emissions intensity levels from shipping iron ore by 50% from 2021 levels by 2030.

The findings of a report, commissioned by Fortescue and published prior to COP30, support Forrest’s ambition, indicating that the world has reached a green tipping point. “Firmed renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy in nearly every corner of the world.”

The economics of Real Zero are clear across three sectors, according to the research, which finds:

Heavy trucking (Europe): Battery-electric long-haul trucks are projected to reach cost parity with diesel equivalents by 2026 – a tipping point for zero-emission transport.

Fertilizer (India): By 2026, green ammonia for fertilizer production will carry only a marginal cost premium over grey ammonia (made from fossil fuel) in parts of India, and by 2030 will undercut grey ammonia in renewables-rich regions.

Steel (Japan): Green hydrogen-based steelmaking could be cheaper than fossil routes by the early 2030s – even sooner with modest carbon pricing – while scrap-based electric arc furnace production is already cost-competitive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-fortescue-166287.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:37.884170

At the FPS Mobility and Transport, we’re committed to facilitating the shift toward alternative fuels.
To make this happen, we combined our expertise in IMO processes with the technical know-how of pioneering Belgian shipowners and Lloyd’s Register.","The Interim Guidelines represent a significant step towards the safe and practical use of ammonia as a zero-carbon marine fuel.

Lloyd’s Register (LR), EXMAR and the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) for Mobility and Transport have helped to develop interim guidelines to enable the safe use of ammonia cargo as fuel on gas carriers

The Belgium FPS Mobility and Transport, with support from LR and EXMAR, led work to secure an amendment to the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code) more than two years ago, removing restrictions previously preventing the consumption of ammonia cargo as fuel. The three stakeholders provided the initial draft of the Interim Guidelines to the IMO Correspondence Group considering the guidelines. Subsequent development involved cooperation with Member States in a Correspondence Group to ensure consensus.

The Guidelines were finalised during the IMO’s Sub-Committee on the Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC 11) and are expected to be formally approved at MSC 111 in May 2026.

Ammonia has long been recognised for its potential as a zero-carbon fuel, but until recently ammonia cargo could not be used as fuel on gas carriers certified in accordance with the IGC Code. The new framework balances safety and flexibility, allowing shipowners and operators to move forward with ammonia-fuelled vessel designs under a recognised regulatory pathway.

Claudene Sharp-Patel, Global Technical Director, LR, said: “This collaboration shows what’s possible when industry leaders, regulators and technical experts come together to enable change. LR has been involved in ammonia-as-fuel projects from their earliest stages through to realisation. The deep knowledge and expertise we’ve developed directly benefit our clients as they look to decarbonise their fleets. Being part of this pioneering work reinforces LR’s position as a trusted advisor and innovation leader in the maritime energy transition.”

Kristof Coppé, Director Fleet Operations and Technical Business Development, EXMAR, said: “EXMAR’s journey toward ammonia as a marine fuel began in 2021, when our company received Approval in Principle from Lloyd’s Register for an ammonia-fuelled mid-size gas carrier. Using our own cargo as fuel has long been a strategic priority for EXMAR. A commitment previously demonstrated through our pioneering adoption of LPG as a propulsion fuel. Ammonia now marks the next step forward, offering the added benefit of reducing direct CO₂ emissions by up to 90 percent.

“Our close collaboration with Lloyd’s Register and FPS Mobility in Belgium has been instrumental throughout this process. Their support, particularly on the regulatory front, has been a cornerstone in advancing this project toward success.”

Nathalie Deleuze, Maritime Expert – Alternative Fuels at FPS Mobility and Transport of Belgium, said: “Decarbonisation is a key priority for Belgium. At the FPS Mobility and Transport, we’re committed to facilitating the shift toward alternative fuels. To make this happen, we combined our expertise in IMO processes with the technical know-how of pioneering Belgian shipowners and Lloyd’s Register. Together, we’re charting the course toward a cleaner future.”

LR’s Fuel for Thought: Ammonia gathers into one place the most relevant information on the use of ammonia in shipping, serving as a convenient reference for shipowners considering alternative fuel options for their fleets, and for maritime professionals seeking a deeper understanding of the zero-carbon transition. The report combines expertise from LR and other shipping knowledge leaders on topics including the current state of ammonia as a clean fuel, including its safety considerations, drivers for adoption, production and supply chain, and technology readiness.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:50.459070

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.
These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government.
Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.
“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.","Australia’s Albanese Government has opened five new areas for bidding in the Otway Basin for offshore gas exploration to lower power prices, in order to ensure that the domestic industry has access to gas at affordable prices, the country’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources said Dec. 11.

The release of new areas follows a review of the process for making new offshore acreage available for exploration and extensive consultation with the industry and stakeholders, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia Madeleine King said on the department’s website.

The development also follows an announcement by the Victorian Government on Dec. 10 to release petroleum exploration permits in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said.

“The release of new acreage supports our Future Gas Strategy and will help ensure Australians continue to have access to gas at affordable prices,” she added.

The Future Gas Strategy maps the Australian Government’s plan for how gas will support the country’s transition to net zero.

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.

All projects will be required to meet strict environmental and emissions standards per usual processes, she said.

Public consultation on the nominated new areas will be open for eight weeks until Feb. 6, 2026, while applications for the exploration permits will close on June 30 next year, she said.

These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government. This offshore acreage complements South Australia’s and the Victorian State Government’s exploration programs, she added.

Releasing new acreage would help address the structural gas shortfalls forecast from 2029 by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the statement said, recognizing that tackling shortfalls is vital for manufacturers who require gas as a feedstock or as a heat source and cannot transition to alternatives in the short to medium term.

Industry welcomes move

In a separate statement on Dec. 11, the Australian Energy Producers said that it welcomed the release of new acreage.

Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.

“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.

“Bringing new gas supply online sooner is the only sustainable solution to put downward pressure on prices,” she added.

In June, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources stated on its website that it was conducting a Gas Market Review in conjunction with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

The review aims to examine the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, the Gas Market Code and the Heads of Agreement with east coast LNG exporters, it said at the time.

“With the outcome of the gas market review expected to be announced shortly, we will continue to work with governments on measures to increase gas supply and ensure Australian homes and businesses have reliable and affordable energy,” McCulloch added.

Australia is among the world’s top LNG exporters, with market participants monitoring the country’s production prospects to determine global demand-supply balances and the impact on international prices of the fuel.

The report finds that while ships are becoming more fuel-efficient, rising economic activity, longer trade routes, and structural fleet trends continue to offset these gains. Shipping represented roughly 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2024—placing it on par with some G7 economies.

Container and Bulk Carriers Drive the Sector’s Footprint

Container ships and bulk carriers account for nearly half of global maritime CO₂ emissions. Over the five-year period, container ship emissions rose 14.7% while bulk carrier emissions increased 10.6%. The OECD attributes the spike largely to increased global trade volumes and higher transport intensity—tonne-miles growing faster than GDP.

Fleet characteristics also play a role. Vessels aged 20 years and older now number nearly 80,000 globally, up from about 70,000 in 2019, extending reliance on older, fossil-fueled hulls. Meanwhile, mega-containerships over 10,000 TEU now represent about 42% of the world’s container capacity. While these larger vessels offer better per-tonne fuel performance, they also lock in long-lived fossil infrastructure.

Efficiency Is Improving, but It’s Not Enough

The analysis uses a decomposition method to identify major forces influencing emissions. Fuel intensity—the fuel required per unit of nominal capacity—showed the strongest downward effect, indicating that ships are operating more efficiently due to slow steaming, operational improvements, and compliance with IMO’s Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). These regulatory shifts, however, have not significantly altered the sector’s fuel mix, which remains dominated by oil-based fuels despite growth in LNG and early adoption of methanol-ready designs.

Distance-driven emissions turned positive in the latter part of the period. Geopolitical disruptions—including Red Sea rerouting, Panama Canal constraints from drought, and altered trade flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—pushed vessels onto longer routes. This added millions of tonne-miles to global shipping activity and reduced the emissions benefits gained through efficiency.

Capacity utilization trends vary by region. Globally, underutilization has increased emissions by leaving more tonnage in operation than needed. In the OECD fleet, utilization improved slightly, exerting a modest downward effect.

Implications for Policy and the Maritime Transition

The OECD’s findings underscore the scale of the challenge facing the maritime sector as it works toward the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition and interim 2030 and 2040 reduction targets. Efficiency gains alone continue to be overtaken by market-driven factors—particularly the growth of global trade and rerouted maritime corridors.

Regulations entering force after 2024 will exert stronger pressure. The EU Emissions Trading System now applies to large ships entering European ports, and FuelEU Maritime will begin limiting the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels. These measures are expected to push operators toward low-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, or advanced biofuels—pathways that E+E Leader reporting has shown carry both potential and sustainability risks.

For companies with maritime-linked supply chains, the report highlights rising exposure to carbon costs and route volatility. Many firms are already reevaluating procurement strategies, assessing the carbon intensity of shipping partners, and tracking whether carriers invest in alternative-fuel vessels.

The OECD’s analysis ultimately reinforces a key trend across the global transport sector: operational efficiency is improving, but structural patterns in trade, fleet composition, and fuel availability are determining emissions outcomes. Without accelerated investment in low-carbon fuels and technologies, maritime emissions are likely to remain on an upward trajectory despite regulatory tightening.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251211-121247-b98-Ships%20and%20communication%20network%20concept.%20maritime%20traffic..jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:56:54.818319

The company aims to provide the global shipping industry with a new green, intelligent and sustainable development path. CATL expects that battery-electric ships will soon be active not only on rivers, lakes and harbours, but on the oceans.

Su Yiyi, Head of CATL’s Marine Division, stated at Marintec China: “CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes and coastal waters and is now evolving towards deep-sea applications. In the near future – possibly within the next three years – we will see fully electric ships on the open sea.”

Ships with a fragmented supplier system

According to CATL, the shipping industry currently faces a fundamental challenge: propulsion, energy supply and maintenance of a ship are typically managed by different partners, leading to coordination issues and unclear responsibilities. Additionally, battery-electric ships face high acquisition costs, a lack of energy infrastructure, range anxiety, complex water conditions and inconsistent technical standards.

These factors represent a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of zero-emission shipping. Moreover, technologies from road transport cannot simply be transferred to ships, as their development must account for extremely demanding conditions such as high humidity, salt spray, long operating hours and high power requirements.

CATL’s new complete solution for battery-electric ships

This is where CATL’s integrated “Ship-Shore-Cloud” solution comes into play. According to the company, it is a bespoke complete solution for the shipping industry, featuring seamless integration from onboard energy systems to landside charging and battery-swapping networks, and cloud-based intelligent management. This approach aims to eliminate the traditional weaknesses of the industry’s fragmented multi-supplier structures.

Onboard, the system integrates batteries, propulsion and intelligent navigation systems to ensure safe and stable operation. On land, a network of charging and battery-swapping stations, along with the “ship-battery separation” model, is designed to significantly reduce energy and cost risks.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems. One example is the excursion ship Yujian 77, which operates in Xiamen Bay and has already been featured by us. CATL is also proud of the Changjiang Sanxia 1, the world’s largest fully electric inland passenger ship, and the Qinggang Tug 1, China’s first hybrid tugboat. Additionally, with the Jining 6006, CATL has demonstrated that battery swapping for cargo ships is feasible.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios.","The shipping industry's ongoing battle with container losses at sea reveals a complex web of environmental consequences and supply chain vulnerabilities that extend far beyond the initial moment cargo goes overboard.

Each year, thousands of containers slip into the ocean, transforming single shipping incidents into chronic pollution sources that persist for decades while simultaneously disrupting global trade networks.

The mechanics behind these losses combine natural forces with human and technical failures. Rough seas, high waves and strong winds create the immediate physical threat, particularly when containers are improperly stacked or inadequately lashed. Human factors including fatigue, poor communication and complacency during loading operations compound these risks, while mechanical issues such as valve failures or uneven weight distribution further exacerbate the problem.

Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC) says: ""Even one container lost is one too many.”

Decades of marine plastic pollution

A February 1997 incident involving the Tokio Express, operating under Evergreen Marine's service at the time, demonstrates how a single container loss can become a long-term environmental liability. Hit by a large wave off the coast of Cornwall, the vessel lost 62 containers overboard, including one loaded with millions of Lego pieces.

The lost cargo has washed up for decades on beaches in Southwest England, making it one of the best-known examples of traceable marine plastic pollution. Many of the Lego pieces were ocean-themed items such as flippers and octopuses, providing marine scientists with valuable long-term data on plastic persistence and drift patterns.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents. Beachcombers and researchers still document finds of these distinctive pieces, creating an ongoing record of marine debris movement.

The longevity of these plastic items in the marine environment highlights the persistent nature of polymer-based materials. This single container loss has generated decades of environmental impact and scientific observation.

Perishable cargo environmental footprint

Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.

On 15 November 2025, a vessel transporting bananas for major importers and retailers lost several containers in the English Channel, leading to large numbers of loose bananas, broken boxes and associated packaging washing up along parts of the UK coast.

While the fruit itself biodegrades, the long-term environmental burden comes from non-biodegradable elements such as plastic wrap, strapping, pallets, insulation and cooler foams that persist in marine environments. These materials fragment into microplastics over time, entering the food chain.

The visual impact of perishable cargo losses often generates significant public attention and media coverage. However, the less visible packaging materials create the more enduring pollution problem.

Refrigerated containers also contain coolants and insulation materials that can release harmful substances when compromised. The environmental footprint of these losses extends well beyond the organic cargo itself.

Industrial materials contaminating coastlines

Beyond consumer goods and perishables, industrial materials constitute some of the most severe marine pollution incidents.

The X-Press Pearl incident off Sri Lanka in 2021 released 70 to 75 billion plastic pellets, known as ""nurdles"", now considered one of the largest marine plastic spills in history. The ship was operated by X-Press Feeders and carried cargo for multiple chemical and polymer producers.

These tiny plastic pellets, the raw material for plastic manufacturing, spread rapidly across vast ocean areas and coastlines. Their small size makes recovery virtually impossible, and they persist indefinitely in marine ecosystems.

Other notable cases include consumer goods such as trainers, motorbikes, televisions, whisky and IKEA products arriving on beaches after container losses on major Asia-Europe and transpacific routes. Biobeads and industrial polymers have contaminated shorelines in the UK and elsewhere, creating pollution challenges that differ markedly from organic cargo losses.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios. Each material type requires different clean-up approaches and presents unique environmental risks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/67d4c168c5d3f1fe3d45b35a36f722bd:d38a7b3e0c2c0929be02941b3ebacd31/gettyimages-1032544878.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:56:52.432224

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.","A lot is expected of global trade nowadays when it comes to sustainability. That said, heavy freight is still widely regarded as a hard-to-abate sector.

Air and sea shipping are the main culprits here. While lorries are able to carry just a fraction of the loads of planes and boats, there are readily available electric alternatives to old school, fossil fuel-powered road vehicles.

Progress is well underway though, whether that's the development of sustainable aviation fuel or the kinds of biofuel or hydrogen that boats are experimenting with.

Regulations are being written to reflect and encourage this gradual transition too. When it comes to ships specifically, a new piece of research by the International Maritime Organization has sought to examine just how effective legislation is at the moment when it comes to nautical sustainability.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the IMO's study is full of data that could prove crucial for how supply chain professionals understand the day-to-day impact of global fuel rules.

The report, which is titled SO₂ and NOₓ emissions from ships in North‑East Atlantic waters, sets out to measure sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) directly, using aircraft and onshore sensors to sample exhaust plumes from 2019 to 2022.

This approach offers a more precise picture of emissions for a sector that operates largely beyond easy observation.

What kind of impact is tighter regulation having on shipping?

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect. Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.

By 2021, this had dropped to roughly 0.31%, and further declined to 0.25% by 2022.

Researchers concluded that “a nearly 10-fold decrease in the mean aFSC demonstrates the strong impact the International Maritime Organization regulation change in 2020 had on sulphur emissions from ships.”

The findings underline a smooth transition toward lower-sulphur fuels across the sector.

The study also gauged nitrogen oxide emissions, finding that the NOₓ/CO₂ ratio was significantly lower in ports than at sea, probably because ships rely on smaller auxiliary engines when docked – an operational factor with implications for port logistics and emission tracking.

How are companies complying with sustainable shipping restrictions?

The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.

In 2019, before the new restrictions, eight of the 19 ships sampled surpassed the 3.5% sulphur threshold then in force.

By contrast, during 2021–2022, only five of the 78 ships tested were non‑compliant under the tougher 0.5% cap. This high level of compliance demonstrates the regulation’s effectiveness, although a small proportion of breaches remains.

Failure to comply still poses risks for supply chain stakeholders, ranging from shipment delays to reputational repercussions.

Collecting this evidence required complex operations, including flying an aircraft at altitudes as low as 30 metres to capture and analyse 130 ship exhaust plumes.

The finer details of the study

Within special environmental zones like the European Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA), stretching across the English Channel, the limits are even stricter. Average sulphur content in these waters was measured at around 0.04%, well below the 0.1% ceiling.

Direct measurements enabled scientists to flag non‑compliant ships that computer models might miss. For example, one container vessel exceeded sulphur limits on the open sea but switched to cleaner fuel closer to shore within SECA boundaries.

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a0d4400bb489589df7433fda5bd66a6c:0d118856c8132941191580789cbe12e2/graphics-for-work-2025-12-10t172834-228.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:04.742795

The new group plans to work with President Trump’s Administration and Congress to establish strong policies that accelerate the use of American-made energy and biofuels in the global maritime sector – thereby establishing U.S. dominance in the future of international maritime shipping.

Adding biofuels such as ethanol, biomethane, bio-LNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel, among others, to the existing maritime fuel portfolio can fill opportunity gaps and help shippers meet both their economic and environmental goals.

Maritime fuel policies and international frameworks are developing rapidly. Incentivizing the increased use of biofuels creates an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made energy produced from feedstocks grown in the United States like corn, sorghum, and soybeans, as well as the organic byproducts and farm waste from several domestic industries. The maritime sector represents a new opportunity to strongly position American farmers and fuel producers to lead in a developing market, leveraging existing infrastructure and encouraging new investments in energy and maritime sectors while enhancing the economic resilience of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

ABMI will advocate for policies that expand market access for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers in maritime applications, and the advancement of technologies that deploy these advanced fuels, planning to work with the Trump Administration and Congress to establish the U.S. as a global leader in maritime fuels policy.

“Every day, America generates organic waste that should be turned into clean, domestic energy. U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies. The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of RFA and ABMI co-chair, said: “The maritime sector represents an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from crops grown across America’s heartland. U.S. ethanol is one of the lowest-cost alternative maritime fuels available at scale and represents an incredibly competitive option for the shipping industry worldwide.”

Thoughtfully crafted international frameworks and national policies can drive demand for U.S. agricultural and waste-derived fuels and therefore support American farmers, biofuel producers, and the rural communities that produce them.

This legislation is poised to transform India’s maritime sector by replacing the outdated Merchant Shipping Act of 1958. The urgency to pass the bill was marked by ongoing disruptions related to separate demands concerning electoral roll discussions in Bihar.

The new bill significantly updates the definition of “vessels,” expanding it to encompass various types of watercraft, including mobile offshore drilling units and submersibles. It allows for partial ownership of vessels by Indian citizens, corporations, and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), subject to regulations that the central government will define. An important provision is the temporary registration of unregistered vessels intended for recycling in India, which is expected to invigorate recycling operations, particularly at hubs like Alang.

A key feature of the Merchant Shipping Bill is the empowerment of the Director-General to oversee maritime education and training. This measure aims to ensure that Indian seafarers receive quality education, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the global maritime arena. Additionally, the bill mandates pollution prevention certificates for all vessels, aligning India’s regulations with international standards by incorporating treaties such as MARPOL and the Wreck Removal Convention. This aims to reinforce environmental protection within the industry.

The bill further addresses ownership criteria, thereby enhancing India’s shipping capabilities and fleet size, which could position Indian shipping companies to compete effectively on a global scale. Moreover, the legislation aligns with international maritime labor standards, establishes a certification system for Indian seafarers, and ensures access to social security, thus fostering improved welfare and working conditions for seafarers.

This mandate has triggered the most significant technological and financial upheaval the sector has ever faced. This article explores the core challenge—the decarbonization dilemma—focusing on the complex regulatory landscape (CII, ETS) and the intense, multi-fuel race to find viable, scalable, and safe ""green fuels."" We analyze the leading contenders—ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen—highlighting their pros, cons, and the colossal infrastructure investment required to power the future of global shipping.

The Green Fuel Race: Solving the Decarbonization Dilemma

The biggest hurdle is the ""decarbonization dilemma"": the need to commit billions to a specific fuel pathway without a guaranteed global supply or regulatory consensus. Currently, three contenders dominate the discussion:

1. Green Methanol 🟢

Pros: A well-understood liquid fuel that can be handled using near-conventional bunkering infrastructure. It offers a clear, immediate pathway for transitioning internal combustion engines.

Cons: Lower energy density than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), meaning larger tanks are required, reducing cargo space. While it burns cleanly, it is highly toxic and its production must be verified as ""green"" (from biomass or renewable hydrogen) to meet climate goals.

2. Green Ammonia ( 🔵

Pros: Expected to be highly scalable and cost-effective as a carrier for hydrogen. It is considered a zero-carbon fuel at the point of combustion (no $\text{CO}_2$ emissions).

Cons: **Highly toxic** and corrosive, requiring extensive new safety protocols and material changes for engines and tanks. Its combustion can produce nitrous oxides ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), a potent GHG, posing a serious environmental and technical challenge.

3. Green Hydrogen ⚪

Pros: A true zero-emission fuel (water is the only byproduct). Can be used in fuel cells, offering extremely high efficiency for smaller, shorter-distance vessels.

Cons: Requires cryogenic storage and has an extremely low energy density by volume, demanding massive tank sizes. The infrastructure for production, storage, and bunkering is virtually non-existent for deep-sea shipping.

Beyond the Tank: Technology and Operational Efficiency

Decarbonization involves more than just swapping fuels. Immediate and complementary steps are being taken to reduce energy demand and bridge the gap until green fuels are universally available.

Energy Saving Devices (ESDs): Technology such as propeller boss cap fins, air lubrication systems, and optimized hull coatings that physically reduce drag and improve hydrodynamic performance.

Wind-Assisted Propulsion (WAPs): The re-emergence of wind power using modern rotor sails or wing sails to supplement engine power, significantly reducing fuel consumption on long voyages.

Digital Optimization: Using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and advanced software for dynamic route optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time performance monitoring to minimize fuel burn.

Conclusion: The Cost of Transition and the Path Forward

The journey to net-zero is characterized by immense capital expenditure: billions must be spent on new vessels, engine retrofits, and global bunkering infrastructure. This investment carries a ""first mover"" risk, but also offers a first-mover advantage in charter markets demanding green shipping solutions.

The industry consensus is moving toward a **multi-fuel future**, where different vessel types and trade routes will adopt the most suitable green fuel. Success hinges on unprecedented collaboration between energy producers, technology providers, regulators, and financiers to ensure safety, scalability, and ultimately, a viable, sustainable future for global trade.

Rising Technological Threats in Global Shipping

The maritime industry, a crucial pillar of global trade, has always grappled with the challenge of piracy.

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?
Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings.
COSCO SHIPPING Holdings does have some risks, we noticed we think you should know about.","What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings ( ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for COSCO SHIPPING Holdings, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.11 = CN¥43b ÷ (CN¥500b - CN¥130b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 5.4% generated by the Shipping industry.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?

Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 11%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 106%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.

The Key Takeaway

A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 416% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Under the theme “Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean,” the conference emphasized the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14), which targets life below water through a three-pronged Nice Ocean Action Plan.

The three main priorities of the conference included:

Completing multilateral processes related to the ocean.

Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable ocean initiatives.

Strengthening and disseminating marine science knowledge to improve policy-making.

A pivotal aspect of the UNOC was progress on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty, adopted in 2023. This treaty is an international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) aimed at conserving and sustainably utilizing marine biodiversity in international waters. Key components of the treaty involve establishing marine protected areas (MPAs), mandating environmental impact assessments for high-seas activities, regulating access to marine genetic resources, and providing capacity-building support to developing nations. The treaty aligns with global biodiversity goals, pushing for the protection of 30% of marine and coastal areas by 2030.

Despite 160 countries signing the BBNJ Treaty, only 56 have ratified it, with a requirement of 60 ratifications needed to initiate a 120-day countdown for it to become legally binding. Both India and the United States have not yet ratified it, with India in the process of doing so, and the U.S. still evaluating its position.

The conference acknowledged significant hurdles in advancing the BBNJ Treaty. Disputes over how to share benefits from marine genetic resources, lack of consensus on regulating extraction activities, and warnings about potential risks to ocean ecosystems and biodiversity are major challenges.

Several notable achievements were recorded at UNOC, including:

Financial Commitments: The European Commission pledged over €1 billion, with Germany, New Zealand, and other nations making substantial contributions towards ocean conservation and governance.

Expansion of Marine Protected Areas: French Polynesia committed to creating the world’s largest marine protected area, while Spain planned five new MPAs to protect a significant portion of its marine territory.

Global Coalitions and Initiatives: The conference saw the establishment of the High Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean to address noise pollution and the One Ocean Finance process, which aims to secure funding from blue economy sectors.

In conclusion, the UNOC 2025 made headway in ocean protection through financial pledges, treaty advocacy, and the formation of coalitions, laying the groundwork for stronger governance of international waters and promoting sustainable practices in line with global biodiversity goals.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-10 19:56:08.306689

Benefits of autonomous ships Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety.
The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.
By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.
This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.","Autonomous vessels are set to revolutionize the shipping industry, whereby they will gradually and eventually transform global maritime trade through advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technologies and remote operations. As traditional shipping faces ever-growing challenges - from aging fleets to rising safety concerns to ever-increasing environmental rules and regulations - autonomous ships offer a compelling solution that promises increased efficiency and safety whilst simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and operational costs.

Whereas fully unmanned ships remain on the horizon, 2025 marks a pivotal milestone as semi-autonomous ships enter practical commercial service, leveraging remote control centres and advanced AI-driven navigation to optimise routs, enhance situational awareness and mitigate human error. Supported by regulatory frameworks and rapid technological advancements, autonomous shipping is set to become a cornerstone of the maritime industry, ushering in a new era where intelligent machines and human oversight work cohesively to redefine how goods move across our oceans.

The IMO's involvement

For the past few years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already been laying the groundwork for the eventual widespread introduction of autonomous ships into the shipping industry. The aim of the IMO is to regulate new and advancing technologies through its framework, whereby they seek to balance the benefits from said technologies against concerns of security and safety, the impact on the environment and on the facilitation of international trade, the potential costs to the shipping industry and their impact on personnel, both onboard and on shore. IMO wants to ensure the framework regulating Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) keeps up the rapidly evolving technological developments.

Following the completion of the IMO's scoping exercise on MASS back in 2021, the main goal of which was to assess which existing IMO instruments could apply to ships of varying degrees of automation, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), through its 109th session, agreed to a revised roadmap for the development of an official MASS Code.

The scoping exercise covered four degrees of autonomy regarding MASS, these being:

1. Ships with automated processes and decision support systems. Seafarers are still present onboard to operate and control the ship's systems and functions. Certain operations may be automated and at times unsupervised, with seafarers onboard ready to take control in case of malfunctions or errors.

2. Remote-controlled ships with seafarers on board. The ship is controlled and operated from another location whereby seafarers are available onboard to take and operate the ship's systems and functions.

3. Remote-controlled ships without seafarers onboard. The ship is controlled from another location without the presence of the human element onboard.

4. Fully autonomous ships. The operating system of these ships would be able to make decisions and determine specific actions by itself.

The outcome of this scoping exercise highlighted a number of critical issues which were present across several of the IMO's instruments, whereby these involved the creation of MASS terminology and definitions, including an internationally agreed definition of MASS and clarification on the definitions of ""master"", ""crew"" and ""responsible person"", particularly in Degrees Three (remote-controlled ships) and Four (fully autonomous ships) as described earlier.

Other key issues identified included the need to address the functional and operational requirements of the remote-control station/centre and the possible designation of a remote operator as seafarer. Further potential gaps that were identified related to manual operations and alarms on the bridge, provisions related to actions by personnel such as firefighting, cargo stowage and securing, maintenance, search and rescue, watchkeeping and information required to be kept onboard for safe operation of the ship.

At the following session, at MSC 110, the abovementioned roadmap was fine-tuned and the committee agreed on the following milestones:

MSC 111 (scheduled for May 2026) will aim to finalise and adopt the non-mandatory MASS Code;

MSC 112 (scheduled for December 2026) will seek to develop a framework for the Experience-Building Phase (EBP) of MASS;

The IMO plans to kickstart development of the mandatory MASS Code in 2028, based on the non-mandatory MASS Code and results from the EBP;

By 1st July 2030 at the latest, the goal is to have widespread adoption of the mandatory MASS Code, whilst its entry into force is scheduled for 1st January 2032, at the earliest.

It is important to keep in mind that the non-mandatory MASS will merely act as a supplement to The International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and that its entry into force will not automatically relax any of the requirements as laid out under the latter. Exemptions from the requirements of SOLAS must be agreed upon by the flag State during the approval process of the non-mandatory MASS Code.

Key issues that are yet to be addressed are the roles and responsibilities of both the master and the remote operator, general questions surrounding liability and the onboard carriage of certificates. The IMO determined that its internal committees are to discuss these issues at future meetings before taking an official position on the way forward, seeing as this will affect the global shipping industry.

Benefits of autonomous ships

Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety. One of the biggest achievements would be mitigation of human error, seeing as it is the cause behind 96% of all maritime incidents. The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.

Moreover, autonomous vessels optimize route planning and engine performance, ensuring improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs. The reduction, and eventual elimination of onboard crew requirements not only cuts costs of labour but also allows ships to be designed with more cargo space, further enhancing economic viability.

On the environmental front, autonomous ships contribute to cleaner maritime operations by minimizing fuel consumption through optimized navigation and the integration of alternative, low-emission fuels. These vessels are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems that swiftly detect and mitigate environmental risks such as oil spills or leaks. By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Autonomous ships, by virtue of their advanced automation and optimized operation, are estimated to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aligning with European Union's (EU) stringent emission reduction targets, one of these being the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS).

EU ETS, which operates on a cap-and-trade principle, enables shipping companies buy and sell allowances for their emissions, meaning that autonomous vessels could benefit from lower allowance costs due to their cleaner operations. This creates an incentive for shipping operators to adopt MASS technologies, as the reduced emissions directly translate into fewer allowances needed and thus, lower compliance costs and aligning with the market-driven push towards a globally greener shipping sector.

Furthermore, the EU's ongoing integration of carbon removal technologies highlights a broader policy environment where innovations like MASS can contribute significantly to achieving ambitious net-zero goals while benefiting from and contributing to a sustainable, market-based climate policy system.

The pitfalls of autonomy

Autonomous ships, whilst offering revolutionary benefits, come with significant challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and reliable integration into the maritime industry. One of the foremost concerns is cybersecurity. These vessels, being heavily dependent on digital communication and automated control systems, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks.

Such breaches could disrupt navigation, impair situational awareness or even hijack control of the ship, potentially leading to collisions, environmental disasters or theft of cargo. Given the complexity of integrating operational technology with information technology systems, the security framework for autonomous ships requires robust design, continuous monitoring, and real-time anomaly detection to effectively mitigate these risks.

Operationally, autonomous vessels face technical and regulatory pitfalls. The reliability of AI in interpreting complex and unpredictable maritime environments remains a challenge, especially under adverse weather or congested port conditions. Additionally, the legal landscape has yet to fully catch up, with ambiguities surrounding insurance coverage and compliance with international maritime conventions.

The human element also plays a major role as the transition to autonomous operations confronts resistance from seafarers concerned about job security and highlights the need for new training paradigms for remote operators and shore-based personnel. Lastly, the high upfront investment costs and the infrastructural changes required to accommodate autonomous ships add layers of financial and logistical complexity that may slow widespread adoption. Overall, these challenges call for a cautious, phased implementation strategy coupled with ongoing technological innovation and international regulatory cooperation.

Conclusion

The rise of autonomous vessels represents a transformative leap for the shipping industry, bringing with it promises to enhance safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability whilst simultaneously reshaping fundamental operational standards and principles. Central to this evolution is the proactive role of the IMO in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to MASS.

With the IMO's ongoing efforts culminating in the forthcoming MASS Code, regulations are being crafted to address critical aspects such as navigation autonomy, safety management, liability and crew responsibilities both in remote and in fully autonomous operations. This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.

One of the IMO's principal goals is the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by about 2050, in tandem with interim goals for reducing the carbon footprint in shipping.

Malaysia prioritises the adoption of low-carbon technology and fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, and hydrogen, in order to accomplish fleet carbon reductions.

We seek to decrease our maritime carbon footprint by incentivising shipowners to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient designs and alternative propulsion systems, consequently complying with the IMO's Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator requirements.

As a key player in Southeast Asia's trade routes, Malaysia has the potential to leverage this role to align national policies with IMO objectives, therefore assuring sustainability, safety, and competitiveness in an evolving global shipping environment.

The upcoming Malaysia Maritime Masterplan 2026–2040, scheduled for launch next year, will serve as a framework for changing the nation's marine industry into a resilient, sustainable, and competitive structure.

From an academic perspective, the 2026–2040 framework represents our most concerted effort to synchronise maritime governance, infrastructure modernisation, and blue economy development.

It builds upon lessons learnt from the Malaysia Shipping Master Plan 2017–2022 (MSMP), which strengthened fleet competitiveness, promoted regulatory transparency, and cultivated maritime human capital.

While the MSMP achieved significant progress, challenges remained in ship financing, port integration, innovation adoption, and workforce sustainability, all of which are being addressed under the new masterplan.

The Maritime Masterplan integrates climate action and low-carbon initiatives into domestic shipping operations.

This not only aligns with IMO's environmental guidelines but also establishes Malaysia as a leader in sustainable shipping within Asean, attracting environmentally-aware multinational carriers and decreasing operational costs via enhanced efficiency.

Maritime safety is also among the fundamental objectives of the masterplan, with continuous initiatives aimed at accident prevention, piracy and robbery suppression, and the welfare of seafarers.

In order to stay competitive, Malaysia's plans emphasise digitalisation and trade facilitation to preserve its competitive advantage.

The masterplan emphasises human capital development, targeting the specialised training of maritime professionals in digital competencies, maritime cybersecurity, and sustainable operations, targeting the global deficit of proficient seafarers.

By cultivating a skilled workforce, Malaysia guarantees that its shipping industry stays adaptable in the face of technology challenges, like autonomous boats and AI-driven operations.

Malaysia's dedication to the Women in Maritime initiative is equally vital, aligning with the IMO's enduring goal of enhancing female representation within the industry.

We seek to develop a more diverse, innovative, and future-ready maritime workforce by enhancing educational opportunities, advancing leadership programmes and enacting gender-inclusive policies at work.

The masterplan advocates for the blue economy, utilising marine resources to foster sustainable development in sectors like aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and tourism.

This comprehensive strategy fulfils IMO objectives and bolsters Malaysia's competitiveness by attracting foreign direct investment, generating employment, and augmenting its participation in global trade volumes.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.

This comprehensive 15-year strategy outlines a framework for addressing issues such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, and technology advancements, while leveraging opportunities in global commerce.

The S&P 500 gained 0.31%, continuing the divergence between broader markets and LNG shipping stocks. Trading volume hit a record high, signalling strong investor engagement at this crucial technical level.

New Fortress Energy led gains with a 29% surge, while Korea Line Corporation jumped 14% on very high volume, breaking out of its summer sideways range. On the downside, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation fell 5.3% to support levels. Natural gas prices continue to diverge: Asian JKM declined to $10.66/mmBtu—near the threshold that attracts smaller buyers—while Henry Hub surpassed $5/mmBtu. Despite fundamentals remaining robust, with Atlantic spot rates at $130,000/day, most companies now stand on the cusp of change, testing support levels that will determine the sector’s next direction.

UPI & SPX

The UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 1.70 points (1.05%), closing at 160.72 points, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.31%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.

Broader View

UPI has reached its long-term support level, similar to the end of 2023, when growth in the final weeks of the year pushed the index into positive territory. We will discuss this topic in more detail in the Chart of the Week on our website.

The price of natural gas for Asia is declining slowly, while it is declining more rapidly for Europe. This is due to warmer weather. Interestingly, the price of US gas (Henry Hub) is rising and has surpassed $5 per mmBtu. The price of January deliveries to Asia dropped from $10.90/mmBtu to $10.66/mmBtu, which, according to Argus Media, is close to the threshold that attracts smaller Asian buyers. According to S&P Global Energy, the daily reference price for January deliveries to Western Europe (NWM), based on ex-ship (DES), is $8.787/mmBtu, representing a $0.45/mmBtu discount compared to the price at the TTF hub. Daily spot prices for LNG tankers remain at $130,000 for the Atlantic and $87,500 for the Pacific, according to Spark Commodities.

The declining price of gas will boost demand, but shipping company shares are dropping. One reason is the limited influence of spot rates on fleets mainly operating under long-term contracts.

The ratio of declining to rising companies from UPI was 12:9, with a median movement of -0.26%. Trading volume reached a record high.

Constituents

The declines were not significant, remaining below 2%, with many less than half a per cent. However, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation (SS: 600026) experienced the most severe loss, falling by 5.3%. The price reached a support level amid increased volume, and the coming weeks will determine the next direction.

The second company with a loss beginning with a two is NYK Line (TSE: 9101). Here, the loss was 2.4%. Despite this decline, the share price remains above support, although only just.

Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) and Exmar (BSE: EXM) recorded almost identical losses, differing by one hundredth of a per cent. These were 1.37% and 1.38%, respectively. Nevertheless, Awilco seems to be poised for more significant growth for the second week in a row, while Exmar is moving sideways.

In percentage terms, further changes are not significant, but one group demonstrates a broader trend. This primarily involves the ongoing movement towards support levels of individual companies. This applies to MISC (KLSE: 3816), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), “K” Line (TSE: 9107), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

Among the rising companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again led with a nearly 29% increase, while Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) rose by almost 14%. KLC broke out of its sideways trend on very high volume and nearly reached the highest prices within its sideways trading range since the summer.

Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rose nearly 5%, trying to sustain its growth trend after a correction.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) made another attempt to rebound from support, rising 4.17%. It has not yet broken through the range.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) increased for the second consecutive week, returning to its previously broken support level. The rise was 3.6%.

Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) made a cautious attempt at growth, rising above the primary resistance zone, which is a price level that has not been sustained. The increase was 2.1%.

Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) remains in the support area but records a 0.5% growth.

The overall impression of the individual companies is therefore not negative, but they are on the cusp of change. However, strong fundamentals do not justify a long-term break through support levels; quite the opposite.

Crystal Ball

The late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to its previous range, where it now trades. This area provides firm support. In the short term, we estimate a rise in volatility of UPI´s constituents.
