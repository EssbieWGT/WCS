This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig.","Global shipping, accounting for ~3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions1, poses an urgent climate challenge in a world striving for deep decarbonization2. As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), responsible for regulating global maritime transport, has continuously updated its objectives. The current goal is to achieve zero-carbon emissions by 2050, thereby deepening shipping’s contribution to climate mitigation3. However, decarbonizing global shipping faces significant challenges4. Some challenges have been widely discussed. For example, long-term projections under different scenarios for global trade reveal a 1–5-fold increase in future seaborne trade5,6. This growth implies that the shipping sector will require amounts of alternative energy, low-emission technologies, more efficient design, and upgraded port infrastructures to offset the effects of trade growth and meet the IMO 2050 goals7,8. However, the development of these alternatives remains nascent, requiring substantial investments of time and financial resources from nations to bridge the current implementation and ambition gaps9,10,11,12.

Geopolitical risks are emerging as another critical challenge to decarbonization efforts in global shipping. Geopolitical risk denotes systemic disruptions arising from interstate conflict, territorial disputes, economic sanctions, regional instability, or armed confrontation, and is commonly classified into action risks (e.g., military interventions, sanctions) and threat risks (e.g., terrorism, regional instability, and rising nationalism)13. These risks disrupt global trade flows, alter shipping routes, and affect fuel supply chains14,15,16, all of which contribute to fluctuations in maritime carbon emissions. For instance, recent geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tensions in the South China Sea, and the Palestine-Israel conflict, have forced vessels to take longer, less efficient routes, thereby increasing carbon emissions17,18. Additionally, geopolitical crises force countries to focus on domestic and regional issues, particularly basic security concerns like energy and food. This shift in focus could lead to a slowdown in global technological development, casting doubt on future progress and investment in decarbonization technologies9. Beyond physical disruptions, more critically, geopolitical risks could influence nations’ willingness to collaborate on decarbonization initiatives, undermining collective efforts to achieve climate targets19.

Recent work examines the localized impact of geopolitical events on maritime operations and concerns about the decarbonization process20,21. Studies by Lyu et al.22, and Xu et al.23 quantified CO₂ increases from rerouted shipping lanes during the Russia–Ukraine conflict and Red Sea crisis, while Shapovalova et al.24 and Hoffart et al.25 demonstrated how sanctions, disrupted fuel corridors, and geopolitical uncertainty alter fuel procurement patterns and delay emissions reduction strategies. However, systematic analyses remain scarce regarding how geopolitical risks reshape national decarbonization commitments across diverse contexts, which is a critical gap given that policy ambition drives sectoral transitions26,27.

However, quantitatively assessing the impacts of geopolitical risks on shipping decarbonization efforts is constrained by two main obstacles: First, establishing a robust causal link requires moving beyond traditional spatial emission attribution to actor-level time-series data, which is essential for causal verification. Existing studies have primarily examined localized shipping emission shifts around major geopolitical events28,29. Although extensive Automatic Identification System (AIS)-based ship emission datasets can capture immediate changes30, they fail to establish causality and remain largely observational. Second, the delayed effects of geopolitical risks are difficult to capture, resulting in a notable gap in longitudinal and cross-national comparative studies. Geopolitical risks exert a long-term impact through structural shifts in global trade and energy markets, reshaping national decarbonization strategies such as maritime operations, fuel procurement strategies, green technology investments, and international climate cooperation31. Nations’ decarbonization efforts vary due to differing geopolitical pressures and environmental priorities, further underscoring the need for research on their evolving and heterogeneous impacts.

This study addresses these gaps by answering a research question, to what extent do geopolitical risk influence the willingness of countries to reduce emissions in the maritime sector? We constructed a dataset of 518,190,352 words from 52 countries and ten major shipping media outlets between January 2010 to April 2024. Using natural language processing (NLP), we assessed attitude shifts towards decarbonization at both general and national levels. We then employed quasi-experimental causal inference to evaluate the effects of geopolitical risks including benchmark, multi-period and heterogeneity analyses. We validated the effects by analyzing actual CO2 emissions of global vessel navigation based on the updated Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) model. The algorithmic framework and model evaluation are described in the Methods.

Our findings indicate that geopolitical risks can reduce national willingness to decarbonize, with heightened geopolitical risks contributing to the further deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. To validate this causal relationship, we analyzed global shipping carbon emissions and found that geopolitical risks escalate emissions and reshape long-term emission patterns. Moreover, the effects of geopolitical risks vary across countries. Nations with substantial maritime trade, advanced economies, and high carbon intensity are more likely to prioritize economic stability and security over environmental goals. When combined with existing research32, our results suggest that this decline in decarbonization ambition could potentially delay the IMO’s zero-carbon target by up to 50 years. In so doing, this research provides critical insights for policymakers seeking to navigate the complex intersection of climate action and international relations.

Temporal trends in attitudes towards shipping decarbonization

To examine the spatiotemporal evolution of the shipping decarbonization attitudes under varying geopolitical risks exposure, we utilized nation-level decarbonization attitude scores derived from NLP-based sentiment analysis of news text big data alongside the Geopolitical Risk Index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello13. The national decarbonization attitude score ranges from −1 to 1 and is proxied as the ratio of the total sentiment score of all text documents in that country for the year to the total sentiment score of all countries worldwide. It reflects the overall attitude of stakeholders or practitioners in the country’s shipping industry toward decarbonization goals, ranging from positive to negative or neutral, which affects the efficiency of their subsequent decarbonization actions. Figure 1a reveals a strong correlation between major geopolitical events and shifts in decarbonization attitudes. Before 2019, attitudes exhibited moderate fluctuations, reflecting a gradual alignment with climate goals. However, post-2019, geopolitical tensions increasingly overshadowed environmental priorities, underscoring the challenge of sustaining momentum amid crises. The 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict marked a turning point, triggering a pronounced and sustained decline in attitude scores across many nations from an average of 0.707 to 0.556. Subsequent events, including the Nord Stream pipeline explosion and the Palestine–Israel conflict, further exacerbated negative trends.

Figure 1b illustrates the geographical variations of geopolitical risk and annual decarbonization attitude across selected countries. The geopolitical risk index exhibits a general increase, with a more pronounced rise in the Global North compared to the Global South. Specifically, regions such as Europe, East Asia, and North America display increases in geopolitical risk, with countries like Russia, and the United States exhibiting particularly high levels of risk escalation. This disparity underscores differing geopolitical pressures between the Global North and Global South.

The line graphs for each country reveal the temporal dynamics of national decarbonization attitudes. Key observations indicate greater volatility and frequent changes in decarbonization attitudes until 2018, likely reflecting evolving policy responses and strategic adjustments as nations established frameworks for shipping sector decarbonization. However, the shipping industry’s attitude toward decarbonization has improved since 2018. This is mainly due to two factors: the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has catalyzed relevant international green shipping policies, and green shipping investment has undergone a structural transformation. Specific instances include: the launch of the global ship financing initiative known as the “Poseidon Principles” and the active response from financial institutions; the signing of the “Clyde Bank Declaration” by 22 countries to jointly build a “green shipping corridor”; and the rapid development of green shipping finance—the issuance of the industry’s first green bond by Japanese shipowner NYK Line is a clear testament to this. Nevertheless, a discernible deceleration in decarbonization momentum is observed post-2020. This slowdown is particularly evident in several Global North countries, such as European nations and Middle Eastern states, where heightened geopolitical risks appear to coincide with a diminished commitment to decarbonization. In Europe, for instance, countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France exhibit a decline in the growth rate of decarbonization attitudes after 2021. Similarly, Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates display a notable decline. Conversely, countries in Southeast Asia (such as Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia) display more consistent and less volatile decarbonization attitudes, with comparatively subdued changes.

Detecting the impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes

We quantify the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes using a difference-in-differences analysis with staggered treatment (staggered DID) analysis (see “Methods”). Figure 2 presents the empirical regression results and parallel trends test results. Figure 2a reports the main estimates, incorporating nation-level control variables. The coefficient of Geo_risk×Intensity is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. Specifically, the result indicates a decrease of 14.38 percentage points in decarbonization attitudes following the treatment.

Figure 2b provides support for parallel trends, the main causal assumption of DID designs, which requires that treatment and control groups follow similar outcome trends before the intervention, thereby allowing post-treatment divergence to be attributed to the causal effect. Prior to the occurrence of geopolitical risk (−1 Period), the coefficient estimates are insignificantly different from 0, indicating no significant difference between the treatment and control groups before the shocks. Following the onset of geopolitical risk, the decarbonization attitudes decrease significantly in the sample experiencing geopolitical risk, consistent with the benchmark regression results. Figure 2b further illustrates a persistent negative shift in decarbonization attitudes following major geopolitical disruption.

Figure 2c provides the detailed benchmark regression results, with all regressions controlled for country and time fixed effects. The estimates remain consistent across different controls, underscoring the detrimental effect of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (1) to (2) show the effect of non-intensity geopolitical risk, measured as the average risk level for each country over the study period. Columns (3) to (4) examine the impact of intensity geopolitical risk, measured by multiplying the mean value by the corresponding annual geopolitical risk level. The coefficients of intensity geopolitical risk (columns 3 and 4) amplify both the significance and scale of the observed impacts, emphasizing the instantaneous impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (2) and (4) include nation-level control variables to account for additional factors that may simultaneously affect a country’s decarbonization attitude. All coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level or better. Specially, the coefficients of Port development and Carbon peak are negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that countries with higher port throughput and peak carbon dioxide emissions are more susceptible to geopolitical risks, causing them to waver their decarbonization stance. This finding provides empirical evidence for the Tragedy of the Commons in the current climate actions of the shipping sector.

Comprehensive robustness tests reinforce the reliability and validity of our findings (see Supplementary Results 2).

We also observe pronounced temporal volatility in national maritime decarbonization attitudes in Fig. 1b, which may reflect the sensitivity of sustainability commitments to evolving geopolitical dynamics. To further explore this relationship, we performed a staged regression analysis to examine how the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes evolves over time. We divided the time period into three distinct time spans: 2010–2013, 2014–2017, and 2018–2021. As shown in Fig. 3, geopolitical risks had no significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes in the first stage (Column 1). However, in the second and third stages (Columns 2 and 3), the coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are all negative and statistically significant at the 1% level, with geopolitical risks in the third stage exerting increasingly detrimental effects. This suggests that geopolitical risk has a significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes, and this impact deepened over time.

We conducted another two-stage regression analysis, excluding the initial period of 2010–2013. The remaining time period was divided into two equal spans: 2013–2018 and 2018–2023. The coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are consistently negative and statistically significant (Columns 4 and 5), indicating a causal relationship between geopolitical risk and diminishing national decarbonization attitudes. We observe a statistically significant relationship at the 1% level in the later stages, reflecting a stronger causal link between geopolitical risks and declining decarbonization attitudes over time. It suggests that heightened geopolitical risks substantially contribute to the deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig. 1a). However, this effect diminishes in the second period, comparing −0.1591 and −0.1285. As discussed in reference to Fig. 1b, IMO has adopted a more comprehensive and frequent set of climate-responsive measures since 2018. This suggests that climate policies need to be continuously strengthened and monitored to effectively counteract external risks.

The heterogeneity in national decarbonization attitudes

Building on the benchmark and multi-period regression analyses, we proceed to examine how national decarbonization attitudes vary across countries when confronted with geopolitical risks, thereby providing a deeper understanding of heterogeneous responses. To examine these differences, we classified countries into two groups: the top 50% and the bottom 50%, which enables us to highlight the variations between nations with differing economic scales, military strengths, and cultural backgrounds in their responses to geopolitical challenges. Detailed indicator settings and regression results are provided in Supplementary Results 2.

Figure 4 illustrates the heterogeneity analysis of national decarbonization attitudes in response to geopolitical risks, highlighting how different countries are variably affected by national characteristic factors. The coefficients for almost all groups are significantly negative, revealing that increased geopolitical risk correlates with a decline in decarbonization willingness. However, the degree of this effect varies significantly across nations.

First, we examined the level of economic development, degree of openness, and carbon emission intensity to analyze the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national macroeconomic and institutional factors. The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative, with the high groups being significant at the 1% level and lower than those of the low groups. This indicates that countries with higher levels of economic development, greater openness, and higher carbon emission intensity are more likely to scale back their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. This trend underscores the complex relationship between economic structures, energy intensity, and climate policy willingness, especially in the context of global geopolitical volatility.

Second, we explored the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national military capabilities and social stability by examining three indicators: military expenditure (MEP), quantity of weapons purchased (QWP), and the origin of refugees (ROI). The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative. Notably, the coefficients for Low_MEP and Low_QWP show greater reductions, with average decreases of ~20.21% and 17.73%, respectively. The coefficient of High_ROI is lower than that Low_ROI, with an average decrease of ~17.17%. This indicates that countries with certain military and social stability characteristics are less prone to reduce their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. It suggests that countries facing greater social and political pressures prioritize maintaining social stability, potentially limiting the impact of geopolitical risks on their decarbonization commitments.

Finally, we investigated the impact of religious and cultural factors, including religious populations (RPO), power distance (PDI), and uncertainty avoidance (UAI). The findings highlight the importance of religious and cultural factors in shaping national responses to geopolitical crises, revealing that such factors can influence policy decisions in diverse and complex ways. The coefficients for RPO groups are all significantly negative, with a decrease of 18.91% for Low_RPO compared to a 14.74% decrease for High_RPO. The coefficients of Low_PDI and Low_UAI are negative and significant at the 1% level, while no significant causal effects were found in the high groups. The results indicate that cultures with more evenly distributed power and higher risk tolerance may be more adaptable in adjusting their decarbonization policies in response to external geopolitical factors. In contrast, no significant causal effects were found in the high groups of PDI and UAI, suggesting that countries with higher PDI (more hierarchical societies) and higher UAI (greater resistance to change) may be less responsive to geopolitical risks when altering their decarbonization objectives.

Verifying the association between carbon emissions and geopolitical risks

Building on our earlier findings on the evolving attitudes toward shipping decarbonization and the disruptive role of geopolitical risks, we provide empirical evidence linking these risks to actual shifts in global shipping emissions. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset of over 100,000 vessels, we quantified the impact of geopolitical crises on maritime CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity (DIST). This analysis demonstrates how geopolitical instability reshapes shipping CO2 emission patterns (see “Methods”).

Figure 5 highlights that geopolitical risks have led to an overall increase in carbon emissions, reinforcing the observed decline in decarbonization ambition. While regional conflicts, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict (Fig. 5a) and the Nord Stream pipeline explosion (Fig. 5b), resulted in moderate emission increases, disruptions within major shipping corridors induced far greater surges in both total CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity across vessel types worldwide (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figs. 12–17). This pattern reinforces our earlier findings that nations with high trade dependence tend to deprioritize decarbonization efforts amid geopolitical uncertainty. This is evidenced by increased emissions along key shipping corridors and a heightened reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes following geopolitical disruptions.

Specifically, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compounded by the Nord Stream pipeline blast, triggered a 1.5% increase in global shipping CO2 emissions (Fig. 5a, b). This pattern was reflected across most major shipping chokepoints, where emissions rose by 1.4% to 15.3%, with energy transport vessels being particularly affected (detailed in Supplementary Figs. 12–17). The outbreak of the Palestine–Israel conflict led to a substantial increase in carbon emissions from vessels compelled to navigate alternative routes around the Cape of Good Hope on Pacific and Indian Ocean routes (Fig. 5c). Carbon emissions from vessels transiting the Cape of Good Hope (chokepoint 12 in Fig. 5c) increased by 61.3% over a six-month period. Notably, shipping emissions between October 2023 and April 2024 rose by 1.36 million tonnes compared to the same period in the previous year.

Concurrently, the carbon intensity indicators DIST and TIME experienced increases of 9.40% and 35.96%, respectively, reaching 28.71 tonnes CO₂ per nautical mile and 0.51 tonnes CO₂ per hour. Simultaneously, ship carbon emissions exhibit a distinct north-south divergence. Carbon emissions from vessels originating in Europe declined, whereas emissions from vessels from West Africa saw a increase. These findings reinforce our earlier analysis, which highlighted the heterogeneous nature of national decarbonization responses to geopolitical risks. While some nations intensified their reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes, evidenced by rising emissions along major shipping corridors and increased energy transport disruptions.

Natural language processing to analyze decarbonization attitudes

Assessing and quantifying the decarbonization attitudes of the global shipping sector and countries relied on seaborne trade is essential for evaluating the feasibility of current climate targets, beyond mere economic and technical assessments. To achieve this, we compiled a comprehensive dataset from the top 10 global shipping industry news websites, as well as national data from Google News and government policies from 52 countries, spanning the period from 2010 to 2024. This extensive dataset comprises 518,190,352 words. The national-level data was analyzed by categorizing publishers such as corporations, industries, and government agencies, within their respective countries. Further details on data sources, collection methods, and processing steps can be found in Supplementary Methods 1 and 2.

This study explores attitudes toward shipping decarbonization on two levels. First, by assessing the industry’s perceptions and responses to decarbonization efforts, it captures the industry’s general attitude, defined as the perceived feasibility of meeting decarbonization targets, ranging from highly negative to highly positive. Second, national attitudes and their evolution are analyzed using NLP on news data, reflecting policies, strategies, and official positions adopted by governments to address climate change and promote sustainability in shipping. National-level data is analyzed by categorizing publishers from corporations, industries, and government agencies as nested entities within their respective countries, with sentiment scores ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive.

Sentiment analysis, a widely used tool in NLP, is particularly valuable in the context of increasingly accessible online text data. It enables the examination of emotional responses to specific events and the evolution of attitudes over time. To conduct the sentiment analysis, we evaluated four NLP methods for model selection, including Lexicon-based models, machine learning, BERT-based open-source models, and transfer learning-based closed-source models. Given the complexity and emotional nuances of our text data, we ultimately chose a closed-source large language model (LLM) based on transfer learning. By designing prompts, building application programming interfaces, and leveraging the Zero-Shot task processing capability of the LLM, we enabled the model to interpret and complete specified tasks, producing the required information. Due to the complexity of the language and the subtlety of sentiment expression, we applied a transfer learning-based model for sentiment classification. This method was selected for its enhanced capacity to capture domain-specific semantic variation and to identify attitudes within nuanced discourse. Benchmarking against annotated data demonstrated an average 9.897% improvement over alternative approaches. A detailed account of model selection and comparative analysis can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Accordingly, our modeling scheme is designed as shown in Supplementary Methods 2. First, we preprocessed all texts and transformed them into a format readable by the LLM. We designed customized prompts for both global and national text data, enabling the LLM to assess their relevance to the decarbonization topic. The LLM then evaluated the decarbonization attitude of each text, categorizing them as positive (1), neutral (0), or negative (−1), and provided supporting reasons for these assessments. Finally, we generated normalized output; a sample of the output can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Next, we grouped the national text data outputs by year and country. By calculating the mean sentiment scores for each group, we captured the comprehensive decarbonization attitudes of each country in a specific year. This process yielded in a 15\(\times\)52 dataset (encompassing 15 years from 2010 to 2024 and 52 countries) along with corresponding mean scores. A detailed sample of our processing results can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Impact evaluation using staggered difference-in-differences analysis

(1) Model specification

To evaluate the impact of geopolitical risk on national attitudes towards emission reduction, we employed a staggered difference-in-differences model to analyze changes in national attitudes towards decarbonization before and after geopolitical risks. Details on the method selection are presented in Supplementary Methods 5. The following benchmark regression model was constructed.

$${Attitud}{e}_{{it}}={\alpha }_{0}+{\alpha }_{1}{Geo}{{\_}}{ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}+\gamma {Contro}{l}_{{it}}+{\mu }_{i}+{\upsilon }_{t}+{\lambda }_{{it}}$$

(1)

Where \({Attitud}{e}_{{it}}\) represents the attitude of country i towards decarbonization in year t; \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\) represents whether country i is exposed to geopolitical risks in year t; \(Intensit{y}_{it}\) represents the geopolitical risk intensity of country i in year t; \({Contro}{l}_{{it}}\) are a set of country-level control variables to control for country characteristics. \({\mu }_{i}\) indicates individual fixed effects, \({\upsilon }_{t}\) represents time fixed effects, and \({\lambda }_{{it}}\) is a randomized perturbation term. Considering the strong correlation between decarbonization attitudes of a country in different years, we also performed country-level robust clustering standard errors. We focus on the coefficient \({\alpha }_{1}\). If \({\alpha }_{1}\) is significantly smaller than 0, it indicates that geopolitical risk substantially reduces a country’s incentives to decarbonize, potentially leading to delays in achieving decarbonization targets.

(2) Measurement of key variables and data description

The explained variable is the country’s decarbonization attitude, derived from sentiment analysis results.

The core explanatory variable in our study is geopolitical risk. When conducting the DID analysis, it is essential to divide the sample into treatment and control groups based on their exposure to policy shocks. However, geopolitical risks invariably affect all countries, making it impractical to create strictly separate treatment and control groups. To address this challenge, we constructed a policy-like experimental DID model that incorporates risk intensity. To determine whether a country is affected by geopolitical conflict (\({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\)), we calculated the mean value of the geopolitical risk index for each country during the study period. Countries with an index above the mean were assigned to the treatment group, while those below the mean were placed in the control group. Furthermore, we set the treatment intensity indicator \({Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) as the corresponding geopolitical risk level for each year. Thus, the interaction term \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) serves as the treatment effect variable.

The fundamental premise of a staggered DID model is the parallel trend assumption, which requires the treatment group (subject to geopolitical risk) and the control group (not subject to geopolitical risk) exhibit parallel trends in their changes over time prior to the onset of geopolitical risks. This study employed an event study approach for parallel trend testing, detailed in Supplementary Results 1.

We employed seven control variables to account for potential confounding factors that could influence the relationship between geopolitical risks and national attitudes toward decarbonization. Each variable was selected based on its potential impact on decarbonization efforts and its relevance to the specific context of our study. Descriptive statistics for these variables are presented in Supplementary Methods 5.

(3) Causality tests

In addition to verifying the parallel trend assumption, we conducted multiple robustness tests to ensure the validity of our results. Details of these tests can be found in Supplementary Results 2.

Test 1: placebo tests

To eliminate the possibility that the observed differences between treatment and control groups were due to time changes, we advanced the impact times of geopolitical risk by 1–8 periods and re-ran the regressions. The result showed that the coefficients of all assumed cross-terms were insignificant, indicating no systematic time trend differences between the treatment the control groups. This confirms the robustness of our benchmark regression.

Test 2: heterogeneity treatment effect test

Although our benchmark regression accounted for national-level characteristic variables, unobserved variables might still introduce estimation bias. To address this, we performed a constrained mixed placebo test using a randomized trial approach with fake treatment units and fake treatment times. The results demonstrated that all coefficients were near zero and followed a normal distribution, indicating that most regression results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the average treatment effect was insignificant at the 1% level, confirming that our benchmark regression is robust against estimation bias due to omitted variables.

Test 3: propensity score matching (PSM) estimation

The robustness of a staggered DID also relies on the homogeneity assumption of treatment effects. If these effects vary over time or across countries, the regression results may be biased. We addressed this by testing the weights of our benchmark regression estimators. Furthermore, considering the complex entry and exit processes in our model, we adopted the counterfactual estimation method for causal inference to construct imputation estimators for regression. Both tests reported insignificant coefficients, confirming that heterogeneity bias in the treatment effects does not compromise our main conclusions.

To mitigate potential biases arising from significant differences in observable characteristic variables between the treatment and control groups before the occurrence of geopolitical risks, we employed a propensity score matching (PSM) method. This approach enabled us to identify and match control samples with observable characteristics most similar to each treatment group sample. The results showed that all coefficients remained significantly negative, demonstrating that our benchmark regression results are robust even after accounting for potential selection bias.

Test 4: variable transformations

We conducted four additional robustness tests on variable transformations. These included reconstructing the core explanatory variable, standardizing the geopolitical risk index to a range of 0 to 1, and excluding samples from periods 1 to 2 before and after the occurrence of geopolitical risks. The results showed that the core explanatory variables remained significant at the 1% level, further confirming the robustness of our benchmark results.

Bottom-up estimation of the shipping CO2 emissions

The CO2 emission inventory of shipping here is estimated using the updated STEAM. The inventory contains CO2 emissions from the main engine, auxiliary engine, and boiler of ships. We applied AIS data from January 2021 to April 2024 and updated ship technical specification data to the emission calculations. The AIS data underwent noise reduction treatment, including the removal of duplicate signal points, eliminating drifted points, etc. We corrected and interpolated missing and erroneous data in the specification information of ships using regression analysis. For more details, please refer to the Supplementary Methods 6. A global day-by-day shipping CO2 emission inventory (0.05° × 0.05°) was constructed primarily based on the following formula.

$$E={E}_{{ME}}+{E}_{{AE}}+{E}_{B}$$

$${E}_{{AE}}={P}_{{AE}}\times {\left(\frac{{V}_{{actual}}}{{V}_{{design}}}\right)}^{3}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{{AE}}$$

The administration also moved to pull the U.S. from discussions with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February, ordering federal scientists to halt work on all climate assessment-related activities.

More recently, Trump and his Cabinet have taken aim at several European Union- and United Nations-backed climate-focused rules and regulations.

While EU leaders have publicly defended these policies, vowing not to roll them back completely, ramped up pressure from the Trump administration appears to have created more wiggle room in some negotiations.

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive

Just this week, the Department of Energy sent a letter to EU officials urging the bloc to roll back the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.

This directive, set to take effect for some companies in 2027, would require those affected to provide reports on ESG effects and establish liability for ESG violations. The primary aim of the rule is to limit harm to the environment and human rights throughout EU and non-EU supply chains.

Under the current language, companies that fail to comply with the regulations will face a fine of 5% of the company’s global net turnover.

The rule has been heavily criticized by U.S.-based companies, who claim it would cause major barriers to trade between the U.S. and the EU.

“[T]he CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote in the letter sent this week, which was cosigned by the Qatari government.

However, while the EU has given no indication that it plans to walk back the directive, European officials appear willing to negotiate some provisions.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament said it would further negotiate changes to the rule during a scheduled vote and hopes to finalize any amendments by the end of the year.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

The EU is just weeks away from imposing the world’s first large-scale carbon border tariff, much to the chagrin of the Trump administration.

The bloc’s carbon border adjustment mechanism will go into effect in January 2026, with the aim of lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with its foreign imports.

In early September, Wright said this rule would create “huge legal risks” for U.S. firms selling oil and gas across the pond, threatening trade negotiations established between the administration and the EU during the summer.

“The whole trade talks would fall apart if Europe or the U.S. don’t hold up their end of the deal,” Wright told the Financial Times. “So I think those regulations significantly threaten the ability to implement the trade deal that was agreed to.”

All members of the EU agreed to support plans to modify the carbon tariff in May by exempting any companies that import less than 50 metric tons annually of its covered goods. This change, which was adopted last month, exempts roughly 90% of importers from the carbon fee.

Deforestation ban

The Trump administration is also facing pressure from the U.S. paper and pulp industry to block the EU’s deforestation ban, set to take effect in a matter of months.

The deforestation law, first approved by the EU in June 2023, aims to reduce the number of products consumed in Europe that contribute to deforestation while also lowering carbon emissions and tackling deforestation worldwide.

Under the law, any products made from commodities such as coffee, palm oil, soy, cocoa, cattle, wood, and rubber must not have been imported from recently cleared forests and must not have contributed to forest degradation.

The law, which was delayed last year, was set to take full effect at the end of this year.

EU leaders further moved to soften the rules earlier this week, proposing delaying reporting requirements.

Under the latest proposal, the deforestation ban will still go into effect on Dec. 30, but will offer relief to small operators and larger businesses in low-risk countries, such as the U.S., by not requiring full checks and enforcement for an additional six months to one year, depending on the company’s size.

The European Commission announced it was considering delaying the entire rule by another year earlier this month — a move many liberal members of the European Parliament said was to appease Trump.

International carbon shipping tax

The Trump administration clinched a major win last week by successfully blocking a vote on a carbon tax on the global shipping industry.

The administration had for months said it would impose unfair burdens on the U.S., as it would impose a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over the lowest threshold of emissions set. Those that exceed higher thresholds will be forced to pay a $380 fee.

The measure, which was included in a net-zero framework put forth by the International Maritime Organization, had appeared poised to pass.

However, the Trump administration heavily lobbied IMO members to consider punting the vote approving the tax by one year.

On Wednesday, Wright revealed that he called nearly 20 countries, saying the U.S. has “the world’s most influential megaphone by far.”

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also said she lobbied nations such as Antigua and Jamaica, calling the administration’s efforts to block the vote “all hands on deck.”

As part of this ramped-up pressure, administration officials levied threats against nations that planned to vote in favor of the measure, including imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and port controls.

Steve Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the Washington Examiner that the administration should continue to use these tactics to further push the EU on other climate-related policies.

TRUMP PREVAILS AGAINST GLOBAL SHIPPING CARBON TAX PLAN, DELAYING VOTE BY A YEAR

“We should basically say we’re out of the United Nations … that puts a lot of pressure on these countries to heed our advice,” Moore said.

“I think that Trump’s stern opposition to these climate change measures is going to force a lot of countries to realize that they’re futile,” he added.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296747887024-e1761323471227.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-26 06:16:28.149501

Around 80% of all the goods we trade, from oil and iron ore to cars and clothing, move by sea. Every day, huge ships connect producers and consumers across continents.

In this episode of Beyond the Charts, we’re unpacking how this massive system works and how it’s changing, based on insights from the UNCTAD Review of Maritime Transport 2025. We’ll look at what’s driving global shipping today, from shifting trade routes and new technologies to the growing pressures of geopolitics and climate goals, and what all of this means for the future of trade.

Let’s start with the big picture.

Growth amid volatility

After the pandemic shock, maritime trade has bounced back, but not quite the way it used to. In 2024, global seaborne trade reached 12.7 billion tons, up 2.2% from the year before. That’s slightly above the average growth of the past decade but well below the boom years of the early 2000s. In other words, shipping recovered, but the long-term trend points to slower, more uneven growth. UNCTAD expects trade to rise by just 0.5% in 2025, essentially flat.

Why the slowdown? Global trade faces a tricky mix of headwinds: weak demand, persistent inflation, and tighter financial conditions. Even the WTO projects that overall merchandise trade will grow barely 0.1% this year.

Beyond short-term shocks, there’s a deeper story: the link between global trade and GDP is weakening. Economies are growing, but each unit of GDP now generates less cross-border trade than before. That’s why shipping volumes aren’t surging even as recoveries take hold.

And yet, volatility remains the defining feature. Think about it: trade collapsed in 2020, roared back in 2021, slowed again with the Ukraine war, energy crisis, and inflation in 2022–23, and then was disrupted once more by the Red Sea crisis. These stop-start cycles make life hard for shippers and ports, which swing between capacity crunches and quiet docks.

Here’s a fascinating detail from the UNCTAD report: in 2024, while total trade volume rose 2.2%, shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. That means ships were sailing farther on average—a direct effect of longer detours and rerouted trade. So even modest growth in trade can mean much higher demand for shipping if supply chains stretch out. But if routes shorten again, the same ships could suddenly be in excess supply.

For now, those longer voyages are keeping ships busier and freight revenues higher. The question is, what happens when the world’s sea lanes normalize?

Geopolitics redrawing the map of trade

Not since the Suez Canal crisis of the 1960s has the geography of global shipping been this disrupted.

Geopolitical tensions and climate shocks are literally redrawing the world’s sea routes, forcing ships to take longer, costlier detours.

Take the Red Sea. It’s one of the most important arteries of global trade, linking Asia and Europe through the Suez Canal. But since late 2023, escalating conflict around the region has made it too risky for many vessels to pass through. By May 2025, traffic through the Suez Canal had dropped almost 70% from 2023 levels. Instead, ships began sailing thousands of extra miles around Africa’s southern tip—the Cape of Good Hope.

The Panama Canal has faced its own crisis, not from war, but from climate. A historic drought lowered water levels and forced authorities to restrict the number of ships passing through in 2024. Between the Red Sea and Panama disruptions, vessels were suddenly traveling much longer routes, causing massive delays and driving up costs.

The numbers tell the story. While total trade volume in 2024 grew just 2.2%, total shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. Container ships saw an even sharper rise,

up almost 19%.

In short, the same cargo now needed more ships and more sailing time to move. That kept freight markets tight, even without a surge in trade volumes.

But there’s a trade-off. Longer voyages mean higher fuel and insurance costs, more emissions, and slower deliveries. According to UNCTAD, global shipping emissions rose 5% in 2024, partly because of these extended detours.

And it’s not just the Red Sea or Panama.

The war in Ukraine has completely reshaped energy routes. Russian oil that once flowed to Europe now travels on longer-haul voyages to Asia, while Europe imports oil from the U.S. and the Middle East instead. That “shuffle” has pushed up average voyage distances for tankers.

Meanwhile, tensions around the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 11% of world maritime trade and over a third of all seaborne oil, continue to keep the world on edge. The flare-up between Iran and Israel in mid-2025 sent tanker freight rates soaring due to rising war-risk premiums.

Even trade policy is reshaping shipping lanes.

In 2025, the U.S. introduced new tariffs and proposed port fees on certain foreign-built or -operated vessels. These measures are still evolving, but they could change how global fleets are deployed and which ports they frequent.

All this is driving a deeper shift in how supply chains are organized. Companies are diversifying production and sourcing, moving away from over-centralized models. We’re already seeing stronger export growth from Southeast Asia—countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia—as well as from India and Mexico.

ow, it’s important to separate what’s temporary from what’s structural.

Some of these detours, like the Red Sea reroutes, will probably end when security improves. But others may be here to stay. Climate-driven water shortages, like those at the Panama Canal, could become more frequent. And geopolitical rivalries aren’t going anywhere. That means global shipping might have to stay permanently more flexible, adapting to an era of shifting trade corridors.

The impact of all this isn’t shared equally.

For businesses, longer routes mean higher logistics costs and more uncertainty.

For policymakers, it highlights the need for secure trade corridors and better regional connectivity. And for consumers, it often translates into higher prices for imported goods.

But the harshest impact falls on developing countries, especially small island and landlocked nations. As UNCTAD’s foreword puts it:

“Small island developing States watch their import bills soar while their export competitiveness erodes. Landlocked developing countries sometimes pay transport costs three times the global average, and that gap widens with each disruption.”

In other words, the great rerouting of global trade isn’t just a story about ships and canals. It’s a story about how distance, politics, and climate are reshaping the cost of being connected to the world.

Container shipping: Navigating new routes and capacity shifts

If you’ve ever seen those giant ships stacked high with colorful containers, you’ve seen the workhorses of global trade.

Container shipping keeps the world’s supply chains running, moving everything from electronics to furniture to clothing in standardized steel boxes that make global trade possible.

But after a wild few years, this sector is now in the middle of a reset, adapting to new trade routes, new partnerships, and a lot of uncertainty.

Let’s start with how trade routes themselves are changing.

The big East–West corridors, connecting Asia with Europe and North America, still dominate global container traffic. But growth is shifting elsewhere. South–South trade routes like Asia–Africa, Asia–Latin America, and intra-Asia were the most dynamic in 2024. As developing economies industrialize and trade more with one another, we’re seeing more direct shipping links between these regions.

This isn’t just about new markets; it’s also about resilience. Shippers are deliberately diversifying routes and building more flexible supply chains to avoid dependence on any single chokepoint or trade lane. In other words, global trade is learning to hedge against shocks.

Now, the industry side of the story.

After the pandemic, container lines made record profits as freight rates hit historic highs. From 2021 to 2022, they went through what UNCTAD calls a “cash-flow boom.” Carriers used that windfall to order a wave of new, larger ships.

Those vessels are now being delivered just as demand growth is slowing. In 2024, total container shipping capacity jumped nearly 10%, the biggest annual increase since 2008, raising fears of too many ships chasing too little cargo. When that happens, freight rates usually fall.

And rates have indeed been swinging wildly.

The Red Sea crisis in early 2024 sent them soaring close to pandemic peaks. By the end of the year, they had cooled, but they stayed well above pre-crisis levels. Then, in the first half of 2025, they spiked again, this time because exporters rushed to ship goods ahead of possible tariff changes and amid rising geopolitical risks.

The report sums it up neatly: trade policy uncertainty, new domestic shipbuilding programs, and shifting alliances are making this one of the most volatile periods in container shipping history.

Speaking of alliances, the industry map is being redrawn.

The long-standing 2M alliance between Maersk and MSC ended in 2025. Maersk joined Hapag-Lloyd to form the new Gemini Cooperation, while ONE, HMM, and Yang Ming created the Premier Alliance.

Meanwhile, MSC, now the world’s largest carrier, has decided to go solo.

These new partnerships aim to match capacity with shifting trade flows, but they’re also causing short-term confusion for shippers about routes, schedules, and reliability.

So where does that leave the industry?

The container sector is coming down from the extreme highs of 2021–22 and entering a more balanced but uncertain phase. Fleet capacity is growing faster than trade volumes. Routes are becoming more diverse. Alliances are reshaping.

UNCTAD expects containerized trade to keep expanding, though at a slower pace than fleet growth. For businesses, that could mean lower freight costs than in the boom years, but also more volatility as carriers adjust.

Energy cargoes: fossil fuels down, gas up

The makeup of what the world ships by sea is changing—and nowhere is that more visible than in the energy trade. For decades, bulk energy cargoes like oil and coal dominated maritime shipping. Today, decarbonization goals and geopolitics are reshaping those flows, some changes temporary, others structural.

Let’s start with coal.

Despite the global shift toward cleaner energy, coal remains a heavyweight in dry bulk shipping. In fact, 2024 saw a 3.3% jump in seaborne coal trade, reaching its highest level since 1980. The main reason? Strong demand from Asia—especially China and India—and industrial stockpiling by several importers.

But as UNCTAD points out, this is a “temporary rebound” rather than a comeback. In the long run, coal’s share in maritime trade is flattening out, while gas and cleaner fuels slowly gain ground. The center of gravity has decisively moved eastward: European and North American imports are shrinking, and Asia now dominates both demand and trade routes.

That means longer voyages, for instance, coal shipments from Colombia or Russia traveling farther to reach Asian ports. Yet, even with occasional demand spikes, the broader trend is clear: a gradual decline in coal’s role as climate policies tighten over the coming decade.

Oil tells a similar story: long-term pressure from the energy transition, but short-term turbulence from geopolitics. In 2024, seaborne crude oil shipments fell by 1.5%, and refined petroleum products slipped 0.7%, extending a pattern of stagnant growth seen since 2010. But interestingly, ton-miles, which measure both cargo and distance, rose: up 1.6% for crude and 6.5% for refined products.

Why? Because the war in Ukraine and related sanctions have forced a massive reshuffling of routes. Europe has cut pipeline imports from Russia and is now buying oil from the U.S. and the Middle East, while Russia sends its barrels east to Asia.

So even though less oil is moving overall, ships are sailing much farther. Tanker markets stayed firm in 2024, not at the wild peaks of 2022–23, but still profitable thanks to those longer hauls. And new players like Brazil and Guyana are emerging as exporters, driving even more long-distance shipments to Asia.

Then there’s liquefied natural gas, or LNG, the most dynamic fossil fuel in maritime trade right now.

Often seen as a “bridge fuel” in the energy transition, LNG has become central to global energy security. In 2024, LNG trade volumes rose 1.1%, but ton-miles surged a massive 12.2%. That means much longer voyages, from Africa and the U.S. to Asia and Europe, as new export terminals came online in both regions.

UNCTAD expects this momentum to continue in 2025 as more liquefaction capacity ramps up. The LNG fleet is growing fast, with a record order book and new routes forming as the U.S. joins Qatar and Australia among the top exporters.

And beyond these fuels?

There’s already talk of hydrogen and ammonia as potential clean-energy cargoes of the future. But for now, UNCTAD notes, they’re more relevant as alternative ship fuels than as major traded commodities.

Critical minerals

For most of the 20th century, oil was the world’s “strategic commodity.” In the 21st, a new set of materials is taking that title—critical minerals. These are the metals that power clean energy and high-tech industries; think about lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and more. They’re what make electric-vehicle batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and smartphones possible. And as demand for all these products soars, seaborne trade in these minerals has surged, turning ships into the new arteries of the green economy.

The report calls this one of the defining shifts of our time. Asia, and especially China, has become the central destination for many of these minerals because that’s where most of the processing and manufacturing happens. Meanwhile, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania are the main sources. Think copper from Chile and Peru, cobalt from the DRC, bauxite from Guinea, and nickel ore from Indonesia almost all flowing toward Asia.

But here’s the catch: production and trade are highly concentrated.

The report notes that global trade in critical minerals “remains concentrated in a handful of exporters,” which makes supply chains vulnerable to both political and logistical shocks. One striking example: in 2023, the DRC accounted for more than 80 percent of all seaborne cobalt exports. That level of dependence mirrors the old reliance on a few oil producers decades ago.

Naturally, this has set off a geopolitical scramble. Importing countries are racing to secure supply.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act both aim to diversify sources and expand domestic processing. On the other side, resource-rich countries are asserting more control, imposing export restrictions, as Indonesia has done for nickel, or adding local-content rules to keep more value at home.

For maritime trade, this means bigger cargo volumes and new routes. UNCTAD reports steady growth in seaborne shipments of bauxite, nickel ore, manganese ore, and copper concentrates, mostly carried by bulk carriers.

Strategically important lanes now link Africa, Latin America, and Australia with Asia’s industrial centers, above all, China. If you trace copper and cobalt flows on UNCTAD’s maps, Asia clearly sits at the heart of this new network.

Is this shift temporary? Hardly.

UNCTAD’s projections show global demand for these energy-transition minerals could nearly triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040. That means decades of expansion in mining, processing, and, crucially, shipping.

While recycling and technology might ease the pressure later, the near-term reality is clear: the ocean trade in critical minerals is entering a long-term growth phase. And just like oil once did, these materials are already reshaping alliances, with countries forging new strategic partnerships around minerals to secure their place in the clean-energy supply chain.

Decarbonizing the fleet

Even as ships carry the materials needed for the world’s green transition, the shipping industry itself faces one of its toughest challenges yet: decarbonization.

Maritime transport is incredibly efficient for moving huge amounts of cargo, but because of its sheer scale, it’s still a major emitter. Big ships burn fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for about 3% of all global emissions. UNCTAD calls this “the gap between ambition and reality”, a gap the industry now has to close.

And it’s not getting easier. In 2024, shipping emissions rose about 5%, partly because vessels had to take longer routes and sail faster to meet delivery schedules. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global fleet still runs on conventional fuels. Only 8% can currently use cleaner alternatives.

To change that, regulators are moving fast. In July 2023, member states of the International Maritime Organization adopted a climate strategy aiming for net-zero emissions from shipping by around 2050, with interim goals for 2030. Then, in April 2025, the IMO’s environment committee approved draft measures under a new Net-Zero Framework, a global system that combines technical and economic tools to drive change.

Here’s how it works:

First, a fuel standard: ships will need to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they use over time.

Second, a pricing mechanism: ships that exceed emissions targets will have to buy “remedial units,” contributing to a new Net-Zero Fund, while cleaner ships could earn rewards. That fund would then help finance innovation, port infrastructure, and a just transition for developing countries.

So, what does a low-carbon future look like at sea?

It won’t be one single fuel or technology, but a mix. LNG is already being used as a transition fuel, making up over a third of all new ship orders in 2024. Methanol is gaining ground quickly, while ammonia and hydrogen are seen as the next generation of zero-emission fuels, though technical and safety hurdles remain. At the same time, efficiency improvements—better hull design, slow steaming, smarter routing, and even wind-assist technologies—are helping ships burn less fuel.

The orderbook shows how fast the industry is pivoting.

As of May 2025, more than half of all ships on order, about 53% by tonnage, are being built to run on alternative fuels. But this creates a “zero-carbon fuel dilemma.” Ships last 20 to 30 years, and no one knows which future fuel, be it ammonia, hydrogen, or something else, will win. That uncertainty makes it challenging for shipowners to commit today.

Existing regulations are also tightening. Since 2023, measures like the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) have forced ships to meet efficiency benchmarks. Those that don’t must either slow down or retrofit—both of which affect costs and capacity.

And if the IMO’s carbon-pricing plan is approved, operating costs will rise further for high-emission vessels, giving shipowners another reason to go green.

But going green won’t be cheap. UNCTAD estimates annual investment needs between $8 and $28 billion for new or retrofitted ships and an additional $30 to $90 billion a year for onshore infrastructure, things like green-fuel production, storage, and port refueling systems. Many older ships will likely be recycled, converted, or replaced in the coming decade as the fleet turns over.

In short, the decarbonization of shipping is no longer a distant goal; it’s a massive industrial transformation already underway. And while the road to zero-carbon seas will be long and costly, the direction is now set: global shipping is finally starting to clean up the cargo that makes the world go round.

Ports and People

Maritime trade isn’t just about ships and cargo. It’s also about the ports and the people that keep this massive system running. The last few years have stress-tested both, pushing ports to become smarter l and more efficient while also reminding the world just how vital human labor is to global trade.

Ports are where sea meets land, and they’ve been under pressure. Even in 2024, congestion was rising. UNCTAD data show that the average vessel waiting time increased from 5.2 to 6.4 hours in developed countries and from 10.2 to 10.9 hours in developing ones. Those few extra hours may not sound like much, but across thousands of ships, they ripple through the entire supply chain, adding costs and delays that businesses and consumers ultimately feel.

To fix this, ports are going digital. Tools like Maritime Single Windows and Port Community Systems are transforming how information flows—allowing ships, customs, and port authorities to exchange data electronically instead of relying on paper or siloed systems. This means faster cargo clearance, smoother vessel scheduling, and more predictable turnaround times. UNCTAD’s data even show that ports using these systems tend to score higher on logistics and trade facilitation indicators. Automation, from yard cranes to container tracking, is speeding things up even further.

But digitization brings new risks. As ports become more connected, they also become more vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cripple operations.

Then there’s the human side of the story. Ports depend on people, and the workforce itself is evolving. There’s been progress on gender diversity; in 2024, women held 39% of management and administrative roles in reporting ports. But in hands-on operational jobs like cargo handling, that figure drops to just 2%. Automation could help change that by making physically demanding roles more accessible, but it’ll take active policy support to close the gap.

At sea, the situation is even more urgent. The industry faces a growing seafarer shortage, worsened by the tough conditions exposed during the pandemic. The report highlights that protecting seafarers’ rights, fair treatment, shore leave, repatriation, and safe working conditions under the Maritime Labor Convention is essential to attract and retain skilled crews. Without them, global trade literally stops.

As automation advances and autonomous ships edge closer to reality, the kinds of maritime jobs will change. Some traditional roles may disappear, but new ones, in technology, data, and remote operations, will emerge. Managing this transition fairly, through training and upskilling, is key to keeping the system both efficient and humane.

Digitalization and human welfare now sit side by side as priorities. “Smart ports” using data, AI, and IoT are becoming the norm, enabling faster, cleaner, and more reliable trade flows. And international frameworks, from the IMO’s Facilitation Convention, which mandates digital port systems, to the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, are pushing for universal adoption, especially in developing countries that risk being left behind.

Looking ahead

Maritime trade has always been called a barometer of the global economy, sensitive to every breeze or storm. And right now, it’s sailing through both: short-term turbulence and long-term transformation.

The challenge is knowing which is which.

Structural shifts are the deep, lasting changes: a slower pace of global trade, new routes shaped by emerging markets, the reshaping of energy cargoes as the world goes green, the rise of critical minerals, and the twin revolutions of decarbonization and digitalization within shipping itself. These are the forces that will define maritime trade for decades to come. To stay ahead, shipping lines might focus on high-growth routes in the Global South, invest in dual-fuel vessels, or build expertise in moving new cargoes like critical minerals.

Meanwhile, cyclical forces, like geopolitical uncertainty, will keep testing the system. The trick is to stay resilient enough to ride out those waves without losing sight of the horizon. A port might expand and digitize, but it also needs contingency plans for sudden disruptions. A shipping company might enjoy a temporary freight spike, but if it rushes to order too many new vessels, it risks repeating an old mistake and being caught in the next downturn.

Ultimately, maritime trade isn’t just about ships or cargo; it’s about connection. It reflects how economies rise, adapt, and endure through change. If the industry can stay steady through today’s turbulence, it won’t just weather the storm; it’ll help steer global trade toward a more resilient and sustainable future.

As one regional delegate at the IMO reportedly observed, the question is no longer whether the world needs a shipping emissions framework — but whether global politics will allow it to set sail.","A global plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry has hit turbulent waters after the United States and Saudi Arabia led a successful push to delay the adoption of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF) — a landmark initiative that sought to make maritime trade cleaner and more sustainable.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework was designed as a key step in the United Nations’ efforts to tackle climate change by targeting one of the world’s most polluting sectors — global shipping. If adopted, the framework would have required vessels to drastically cut emissions by switching from fossil fuels to greener alternatives such as renewable energy-based fuels and wind-powered systems.

The framework also proposed a pricing system for shipping emissions, often described as a carbon levy, which would have encouraged investment in cleaner technologies while funding climate adaptation in developing nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Saint Lucia.

A sudden shift in course

The measure was expected to pass easily during the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)’s meeting in October, following months of negotiations and a breakthrough in April 2025. However, optimism faded when the United States’ White House issued a public statement on October 10, calling the proposed emissions pricing “an unsanctioned global tax regime” that would place “unfair burdens on shipping and the American people.”

The United States’ rejection of the proposal prompted immediate reactions from other major players. The European Union reiterated its support for the deal, while the IMO’s Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez urged countries to act “in good faith” and maintain a united front in combating climate change.

But behind closed doors at the IMO’s London headquarters, negotiations began to unravel. With Saudi Arabia and Russia joining the US in opposition, the once strong coalition in favour of the deal began to splinter.

In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia proposed an adjournment of the meeting for one year, effectively halting progress on the framework. The motion passed with 57 countries voting in favour, 49 opposing, and 21 abstaining.

The decision means the framework, and any formal commitment to reducing shipping emissions, will now be delayed until at least October 2026, when the committee reconvenes.

Island nations left at anchor

The postponement has significant implications for small island nations that are already facing the brunt of climate change. St. Lucia Times understands that the majority of SIDS had initially expressed support for the framework, viewing it as an important step towards securing climate financing and promoting sustainable maritime trade. However, following opposition from major economies, some island states reportedly backed away from endorsing the deal amid uncertainty over its financial implications.

Neighbouring St Vincent and the Grenadines publicly confirmed its decision not to support the proposed framework. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves argued that while his country remains committed to tackling climate change, the proposed measures could place additional strain on small, import-dependent economies.

“While we are committed to addressing climate change, international regulations must recognise the unique vulnerabilities of economies like ours,” Gonsalves said, warning that compliance penalties and increased shipping costs could ultimately “be transferred to consumers, potentially destabilising fragile economic ecosystems.”

The Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal’s terms in April, were two countries that abstained

For Saint Lucia, the government’s official position on the matter remains unclear. However, regional observers note that small island nations are often placed in difficult positions during such global negotiations. They are forced to balance their commitment to climate action with the economic realities of their dependence on maritime imports and exports.

Charting the next course

Although the NZF has been delayed, work on its technical guidelines will continue later this month when the IMO’s Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions meets to refine the framework’s implementation strategies.

Climate policy experts say that while the adjournment represents a setback, the year-long pause could allow for renewed dialogue between developed and developing nations — provided that consensus remains the ultimate goal.

For the Caribbean, and for Saint Lucia in particular, the delay highlights a familiar challenge: the struggle to have the voices of small and climate-vulnerable nations heard in global decision-making arenas.

Oct 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum floated the concept of storing natural gas produced in Alaska’s North Slope and shipping it directly from there, a proposal he said has drawn interest from unnamed foreign investors.

“It could be a second project, just tapping into that gas field and figuring out a way to move it out by ship,” Burgum said Friday during remarks at an event held by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington nonpartisan research institute.

Shipping the gas would require the fuel to first be liquefied through an export facility, which requires billions of dollars to build. Icy North Slope conditions would most likely make it difficult to construct an export plant there, though Burgum said there are months at a time when there is a path through the ice.

The planned Alaska LNG project currently under development includes a new pipeline about 800 miles (1,288 kilometers) long that would deliver the gas from the North Slope to an export facility in Nikiski, Alaska, as well as the residential area of Anchorage, which is facing a decline in domestic gas. The plant would have a capacity of 20 million metric tons per year.

Developer Glenfarne Group is leading the Alaska LNG project. A spokesperson for Glenfarne did not immediately respond for requests for comment on the possibility of shipping gas from the North Slope directly.

The long-proposed Alaska LNG project has been pitched for decades and revived under the Trump administration. The state of Alaska has a stake in the current project along with Glenfarne, through the Alaska Gasline Development Corp.

Burgum last told reporters this week that the front-end engineering and design study for the project, including the pipeline, was still underway and could be finished by December. A formal decision to move forward with Alaska LNG has not yet been made.

The plan, which was designed to set a unified global standard for decarbonizing international shipping.

Originally introduced in April 2025, the framework aimed to create the world’s first industry-wide carbon pricing mechanism and establish a global approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions at sea. Supporters, including the European Union, China, and the United Kingdom, called it a critical step toward climate accountability and regulatory clarity.

However, fierce opposition led by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia derailed the vote. Washington labeled the proposal a “green tax” that would harm trade and consumer interests, while other nations warned it could undermine competitiveness. Behind the scenes, delegates described days of intense lobbying and diplomatic pressure, making it clear the measure lacked the support needed for adoption.

The final count saw 57 countries favoring a delay and 49 opposing it. IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez acknowledged disappointment but urged members to continue working toward consensus. U.S. officials, meanwhile, celebrated the result as a major win.

Environmental organizations and much of the maritime sector reacted sharply, calling the delay a setback for climate action.

But for Pacific islanders, it is a daily reality — one that shapes lives, communities, and futures.

The struggle is not theoretical. It is personal, immediate, urgent, and often painful.

Over recent months, I’ve had the privilege of travelling across the Pacific and hearing firsthand stories of resilience and adaptation.

In the Western Division of Fiji, communities spoke of rising floodwaters and the damage they cause — to homes, crops, and livelihoods.

In Tuvalu, I saw coastal erosion up close, where land reclamation projects are not just infrastructure, but acts of survival.

In Kiribati, infrequent rainfall is making access to water more difficult, straining families and public services.

And in Kadavu, I witnessed mangrove planting — a quiet but powerful response to the creeping loss of coastline.

These experiences have stayed with me. They speak to the difficult decisions Pacific communities are making every day. My message is simple: you are not alone.

In the UK, we recognise that fossil fuels and a carbon-intensive future are the root drivers of climate change – and the consequences are already being felt across the Pacific.

These are not just technical shifts, but moral choices. Every tonne of carbon avoided and every clean energy investment made helps ease the burden on communities already living on the frontlines of this crisis.

That’s why actions like phasing out coal and accelerating decarbonisation matter.

On October 1, Great Britain completed 12 months coal-free in our energy infrastructure – a landmark moment in our journey to a fossil-free future.

The closure of Ratcliffe-on-Soar, our final coal-fired power station, came a year ahead of schedule. In just a decade, coal’s share of electricity generation in Great Britain fell from around a third to zero.

According to the World Resources Institute, this is the second-fastest coal power phase-out in the world.

The UK has also cut emissions by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2022, becoming the first major economy to do so, while growing and diversifying our economy.

This transition has not been easy. It has required tough decisions by successive British governments and the British public. But it reflects our national commitment to decarbonise our power sector by 2030 and to become a clean energy superpower. We are investing in renewables, supporting clean energy jobs, and sharing our journey with international partners.

Great Britain’s coal-free milestone is especially significant given our history.

We were the first country in the world to burn coal for electricity. Coal powered our Industrial Revolution and shaped our economy for generations.

But today, our actions are helping build a coal-free world.

In 2015, the UK became the first national government to commit to phasing out unabated coal, setting a target date of 2025.

This is part of a wider trend: the UK leads globally through the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which now includes 180 members across every continent.

The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) program — representing a commitment of over $F30 billion — is delivering real impact across the globe. Since its launch in 2011, it has helped more than 100 million people adapt to the effects of climate change and provided nearly 70 million with improved access to clean energy.

It has contributed to the reduction or avoidance of over 86 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, protected more than 413,000 hectares of forests and ecosystems, and mobilised £14 billion in climate finance, equally split between public and private sources.

Globally, coal power remains the largest source of energy-related CO₂ emissions. The latest data shows coal capacity is still rising – by 2 per cent last year, reaching 2,130GW. One major economy opens two coal-powered stations a week. However, to keep 1.5°C within reach, we need to retire an average of 126GW of coal capacity per year – roughly two coal plants every week – for the next 17 years.

That’s why the UK recently stood firmly behind the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF) — a landmark proposal to decarbonise global shipping by incentivising cleaner fuels and aiming for net-zero maritime emissions by 2050.

Approved in principle earlier this year, the NZF was a major step toward aligning the sector with the Paris Agreement and sending a clear signal to industry that the age of fossil-fuelled shipping is ending.

At the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting last week, however, the Framework’s adoption was postponed by at least one year. Despite this, the UK stood alongside our Pacific Island partners in support of the NZF’s immediate adoption. We remain committed to advancing the Framework and building consensus. We will continue to champion maritime decarbonisation, backed by nearly $F1 billion investment through UK SHORE – a program to address maritime emissions and create skilled jobs — and our Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.

My visit to Tuvalu concluded with a fatele ceremony – a communal performance by one island community, where the steady pulse of central drumming set the rhythm for dancers encircling them to rise in tempo and intensity.

As the movement and sound built to a unified crescendo, it stirred an almost involuntary urge among those watching to take part (I’m pleased to say I did!). It was more than a cultural moment; it was a living metaphor for the kind of collective global effort we need to confront climate change — with the Pacific at its heart and a call for all to join in.

The UK is listening and acting. As we look ahead to COP30 in Brazil and the exciting prospect of a Pacific COP at COP31, the UK is proud to support Pacific priorities on climate, including decarbonisation. Our own coal-free milestone — marking 12 months without coal-fired power — is our moment to step into the global choreography of climate action. It reflects our commitment to a fossil-free future and our belief that climate action must be shared, sustained, and deeply felt.

The tempo is rising. The world must respond – together.",https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-25-174431.png,N,,2025-10-25 15:16:29.879869

Will pressure from the United States and other fossil fuel-producing countries succeed in further weakening the work of countries in favour of decarbonising maritime transport over the next year?
And what influence will the United States' threats to not only states, but also their officials have?","The Net Zero Framework (NZF) is the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) plan for decarbonising the maritime transport sector, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20-30% by 2020 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Tentatively approved last April with 63 states in favour and 16 against, the NZF was due to be formally adopted yesterday, Friday 17 October, on the last day of the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2), opened on 14 October at the IMO headquarters in London.

Yet the United States, with the support of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and other countries, managed to prevent its adoption through threats and an attempt to change the procedural rules, which, if passed, could have proved to be a trap that would have effectively blocked its adoption indefinitely.

Throughout the week, the most important flag states, those with the largest number of registered ships and which transport the largest quantities of goods, remained silent. However, according to Lloyd's List, the states representing well over 50% of global tonnage have changed their position since April. At that time, they were in favour of adopting the NZF. Now, many have decided to abstain or vote against its adoption. The IMO meeting therefore ended with 57 states in favour (49 against) of postponing the vote on the adoption of the NZF until next year.

Threats and attempts to change procedural rules

In the months and weeks leading up to the meeting, the United States threatened tariffs and retaliation against countries that supported the plan. On 10 October, in a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transport Sean Duffy reiterated the threats, and indicated that the United States was prepared to take retaliatory measures against officials from the various states. Retaliation could include blocking ships flying the flags of those countries in US ports, placing restrictions and fees on visas, and imposing sanctions on officials who, according to Rubio and Duffy, “support climate policies promoted by activists.”

As reported by Lloyd's List, the United States has also sought to block the adoption of the Net Zero Framework by proposing a change to the procedural rules, calling for a shift from “tacit” to “explicit” acceptance, which would make it easier to block the plan.

Since 1973, the decision-making system within the IMO has been one of tacit acceptance: that is, an amendment to the MARPOL Convention enters into force 10 months after its formal adoption by the MEPC, unless one-third of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or countries representing 50% of the world's gross tonnage, object.

Explicit acceptance, on the other hand, requires that after formal adoption, at least two-thirds of the contracting governments must write to the IMO to confirm their acceptance. As reported on the IMO website, the explicit acceptance process “is time-consuming and most amendments adopted in this way have never entered into force”. The Net Zero Framework was developed with the tacit acceptance system in mind, and switching to explicit acceptance at this stage of the process would effectively ensure that it would never enter into force.

Most countries, led by Denmark, Canada, Australia, Kenya and some EU states, urged the MEPC to maintain tacit acceptance. Brazil, which will host COP30 on climate change in December, defended the NZF and tacit acceptance, accusing the United States of threatening multilateralism, condemning the use of “methods that should never be used between sovereign nations” and adding that “we hope this will not replace negotiations as the normal way of making decisions.”

India also defended implicit acceptance, while, according to Lloyd's List, China's position was more ambiguous, as on Tuesday it expressed support for the NZF but on Wednesday seemed to lean towards explicit acceptance.

On Friday, Singapore, previously in favour of the NZF, proposed that nations postpone the vote until next year. The proposal was supported by Saudi Arabia, which, along with other fossil fuel-producing countries, has opposed the Net Zero Framework since the beginning of the discussions.

The European Union has split

The European Union normally votes as a united front at the IMO and, in the case of a vote on the adoption of the NZF, should have supported it with a yes vote. However, according to observers, three of its major maritime states, Greece, Cyprus and Malta, were considering abstaining from the vote during the week. This news was later debunked by Malta.

Yet, during the vote on Singapore's motion to postpone the vote on the adoption of the NZF until next year, according to Lloyds List, Greece and Cyprus abstained, violating EU rules and reflecting the strong concerns of their maritime industries about the increased costs of using fossil fuels.

“Crucially, the EU must continue to strengthen its own green shipping ambitions and retain its own maritime policies which now stand as the only substantive regulations to tackle shipping emissions in the void left by the IMO NZF,” said the NGO Transport & Environment in a press release after the meeting, according to which “Bold regional action is still possible with or without the US.”

Reactions from NGOs and observers

“Adoption through explicit ratification of the current amendments leads to delays and prolonged uncertainty that could last for years or decades,” warned the World Shipping Council, pointing out that this kind of uncertainty is what prevents shipping companies from making the green investments needed to achieve the IMO’s decarbonisation goal.

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping's contribution to climate breakdown,” claimed John Maggs, representative of the Clean Shipping Coalition at the IMO. “However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimise fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure. There's no time to waste, at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.”

“The collapse of MEPC talks and the one-year delay in adopting IMO’s Net Zero Framework aren’t just procedural, we all know they’re political,” said Eman Abdalla, Strategic Advisor in the Global Maritime and Supply Chain, on the outcome of the meeting. “What’s at stake isn’t the headline target for 2050, it’s the credibility of the transition itself. The more we delay operational, scalable measures, the more we will pay later; financially and environmentally. Leadership in shipping must now shift from conference rooms to companies, cargo owners, and financiers who can move faster than politicians.”

“Although the Net-Zero framework is far from perfect, its adoption would have been an important step in maintaining the IMO’s commitment and in sending important signals to an industry that not only demanded a global framework but actively supported this agreement,” Maggs added.

According to Bloomberg, the delay in voting could represent a setback for climate diplomacy and multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month's COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

“We are not conducting climate negotiations here, but geopolitical negotiations,” said Faig Abbasov, director of the maritime sector at the NGO Transport & Environment, speaking from the sidelines of the talks. “The United States is waging war on multilateralism, UN diplomacy and climate diplomacy, at this meeting, inside the building and outside.”

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying”, added Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment. “The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

What is going to happen now?

It is unclear what the diplomatic consequences of the postponement will be on the vote for the Net Zero Framework. Will pressure from the United States and other fossil fuel-producing countries succeed in further weakening the work of countries in favour of decarbonising maritime transport over the next year? Or will the European Union and other states in favour of the NZF be able to find alternative ways forward?

And what influence will the United States' threats to not only states, but also their officials have? Will they be intimidated after seeing the results of US sanctions against the UN rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, who cannot even open a bank account or carry out financial transactions in any country?

And what to make of the suggestion from Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, advocate of stricter global regulations to halt climate change, who sent IMO delegates a letter stating that he is “ready to support any country or individual being blackmailed or threatened”? “You are not alone,” Forrest added. “I am committed to working with others to ensure that justice prevails and bullying tactics do not win out.” Are we really in a world where sovereign states need to be protected by billionaires in order to develop regulations against climate change?",https://www.renewablematter.eu/assets/Uploads/64-glistatiunitihannobloccatolE28099adozionedelnetzeroframework_ballerini54853114232_eb89758999_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:13.634223

The second section conducts a global analysis of the entire industrial chain – from production and storage to transportation, port refueling, and marine applications – examining the development of green hydrogen, green methane, green methanol, green ammonia, and biofuels. The third section focuses on China's domestic landscape, assessing the current status, future prospects, and challenges in the sustainable shipping fuel industry. It offers actionable recommendations at three strategic levels: national policy frameworks, fuel manufacturers, and the shipping sector.

The release of the ""Report of China Sustainable Shipping Fuel Development 2025"" will provide important references for industrial policy formulation, technology route selection, fuel layout planning, and the construction of port storage and refueling facilities. It will support China in building a development system for a sustainable shipping fuel industry chain and supply chain with leading technology, complete industrial chain, and sound mechanisms, and help ensure the safe application and development of sustainable shipping fuels in the shipping sector.",https://en.portnews.ru/favicon.svg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:21.870956

Two floating LNG units (FLNGs) were ordered by Mexico’s Amigo LNG at Dubai Drydocks in the United Arab Emirates.
Hanwha placed two LNGC orders under its own account in July and August, marking the first LNG carrier orders in the United States since the 1970s.
As of September 2025, South Korean shipyards held 65% of the global LNG orderbook, while Chinese yards accounted for 33%.

Only 38 vessels were ordered in the first nine months of the year, compared with 86 in the same period of 2024—a 56% decline.

The orderbook-to-fleet ratio has continued to weaken, pressured by higher deliveries and low new orders. Drewry attributed the slowdown to delayed final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2024 and early 2025, high newbuild prices, and increased uncertainty stemming from the U.S. Section 301 trade measures, as well as stricter environmental rules such as the EU Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime.

By the end of the third quarter of 2025, only 17 LNG carriers (LNGCs) had been ordered, compared with 73 in the same period last year.

In contrast, LNG bunker vessels (LNGBVs) have seen stronger demand, with 19 orders placed. Two floating LNG units (FLNGs) were ordered by Mexico’s Amigo LNG at Dubai Drydocks in the United Arab Emirates.

Drewry forecasts that total orders for 2025 will reach about 50 vessels, down from 96 in 2024, with the global orderbook currently at 335 vessels and an orderbook-to-fleet ratio of 41%. The consultancy expects further weakening until new orders recover, likely starting in 2026.

Ordering activity showed signs of recovery in the third quarter.

Nine LNGCs were ordered, surpassing the eight placed in the first half of the year.

Hanwha placed two LNGC orders under its own account in July and August, marking the first LNG carrier orders in the United States since the 1970s. These vessels will be partly built in South Korea and completed and flagged in the U.S. The decision is viewed as a strategic response to the U.S. Trade Representative’s Section 301 requirement that 1% of U.S. LNG exports be carried on U.S.-built and -flagged LNG carriers, a costly condition given the estimated $250 million per vessel price.

As of September 2025, South Korean shipyards held 65% of the global LNG orderbook, while Chinese yards accounted for 33%. No LNGC orders have been placed at Chinese shipyards this year, reflecting market uncertainty caused by U.S. trade regulations and potential port fees targeting Chinese-built vessels. However, Chinese yards have secured 58% of LNGBV orders.

Drewry noted that while 2025 marks a downturn, investments are expected to accelerate from 2026 due to rising LNG project approvals, expanded shipyard capacity, and the need to replace aging fleets.

Drewry anticipates continued demand for LNGBVs and small-scale LNGCs through 2030, driven by the expansion of LNG-fuelled fleets—projected to exceed 1,000 vessels by 2027—and growing bunkering infrastructure. The firm cautioned, however, that high newbuild costs, regulatory uncertainty, and the International Maritime Organization’s pending Net-Zero Framework may influence the pace of recovery.

“While last week’s delay was unwelcome, it’s only a postponement, not the end of the NZF,” said Delaine McCullough, CSC President. “At this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states engaged constructively in preparing implementation guidelines. This shows broad support for the NZF and signals that progress is still possible.”

The Net-Zero Framework aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping in line with the IMO GHG Strategy. Key elements include:

Global Fuel Standard (GFS): Gradually limits the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy in ship fuels, considering full fuel life-cycle emissions.

GHG Pricing Mechanism: Encourages the shipping industry to reduce emissions in alignment with the GFS.

John Maggs, CSC representative at IMO, noted, “Member states won’t have to wait a year to tackle shipping’s climate impact. At MEPC 84 in April 2026, they can strengthen the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s core energy efficiency tool. Enhancing the CII can bring shipping climate action back on course quickly.”

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, added: “Even with the adoption pause, negotiations advanced on implementation guidelines. Success will depend on guidance that both incentivizes green e-fuel production and prevents unsustainable fuels with hidden environmental impacts.”

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, emphasized: “IMO member states must consider environmental, human, health, social, and Indigenous Peoples’ rights in shaping the full marine fuels pathway. Despite the delay, work continues to create a just path for the shipping sector to meet 2050 net-zero goals.”

Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, highlighted wind propulsion’s potential: “The Net-Zero Framework may be delayed, but support for wind propulsion is growing. Governments must ensure guidelines enable its global adoption—it reduces fuel costs, cuts emissions, and keeps shipping competitive.”

Jenny Helle, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The shift toward cleaner fuels and technologies is already underway. Rolling back ambition now would slow maritime decarbonization. This week, IMO member states supported science-based guidelines, life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward system for clean fuels and technologies, and revenue distribution to help small island developing states and least developed countries transition.”",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15cd84cf-4ce5-4462-04d2-722882e6cabb.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:37.196062

A crucial meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held in London between October 14-17, was expected to adopt a landmark deal: the Net-Zero Framework, a global mechanism to price carbon emissions from ships and use the proceeds to help developing countries transition to green shipping. Instead, after four days of tense and acrimonious negotiations, the decision was deferred for a year.

Advt

The setback marks a turning point in global climate governance. What began as a technical discussion on emission standards turned into a geopolitical tussle. Oil producing nations, led by Saudi Arabia, mounted a vigorous campaign against the framework, while the United States openly warned of trade retaliation, investigations, regulations, financial penalties, sanctions and port restrictions on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework, if the agreement passed.

In the end, the proposal to suspend adoption by a year was passed by a narrow 57–49 vote–halting progress on a deal that could have been the first truly global carbon-pricing regime in any industry.

The Net-Zero Framework was no reckless “global tax,” as its opponents alleged. It was a carefully designed system, backed by detailed assessments by the IMO, UNCTAD, and the World Maritime University, showing that developing nations would be net beneficiaries. The plan proposed a Net-Zero Fund–financed by carbon levies on ships–to channel billions into developing countries through grants, technology transfer, and capacity-building. The intent was clear: those with the ability to pay would contribute, and those with the greatest need would receive support to modernize their fleets, ports, and fuels.

Advt

For India, the framework represented not a cost, but an opportunity. As an oil-importing, developing economy with rising ambitions in green shipbuilding, alternative fuels, and ship recycling, India stood to gain significantly. A global carbon price would have spurred demand for low-emission vessels, giving Indian shipyards a competitive edge under the government’s ₹69,725 crore maritime development program cleared by the Union Cabinet in September. The credit-note scheme, a key plank of the programme, linking ship recycling at Alang in Gujarat to new ship orders could have gained early traction, with older vessels being retired sooner under stricter emission norms.

Equally important, the framework would have strengthened India’s plans to become a hub for green hydrogen and ammonia–fuels seen as key to the decarbonisation of shipping. By pricing fossil fuels higher, the framework would have narrowed the cost gap between conventional and green fuels, driving investment and offtake.

India, with its low-cost renewable potential and ongoing National Green Hydrogen Mission, was well placed to capture this market. Now, with the delay in finalising a deal at the IMO, that demand signal has weakened, and regional mechanisms–such as Europe’s Emissions Trading System for shipping–will dominate the early market. Europe’s scheme is expected to raise over €10 billion annually, revenues that could have instead contributed to a shared global fund for developing nations.

Fragility of multilateralism

The broader fallout, though, lies in what this episode reveals about the fragility of multilateralism. The IMO, long viewed as a model of consensus-driven rulemaking, was shaken by power politics and procedural brinkmanship. The United States’ hardball tactics–threatening to ignore any global carbon price and penalise those who supported it–were described by observers as unprecedented in a UN agency. For many smaller islands and African states, the outcome felt like a betrayal of global cooperation.

India’s role in this moment of reckoning was particularly crucial. Just a few months ago, India supported the Net-Zero Framework, recognising its balance between ambition and equity. This time, however, it chose caution –aligning with the delaying bloc. While the reasoning may have been diplomatic prudence, the optics were unfortunate. When much of the Global South looked to India for leadership, New Delhi’s silence left a vacuum. Brazil and South Africa, by contrast, stood firmly for adoption and were seen as voices of equitable climate action.

The consequences for India go beyond the maritime domain. The country’s aspiration to lead the Global South and to be a bridge between developed and developing nations depends on its ability to combine moral leadership with pragmatic action. Supporting a measure that embedded fairness and finance for developing countries would have strengthened that claim. Instead, India’s neutrality at a defining moment may be construed as retreat.

In the end, the IMO’s delay is not just about ships or carbon. It is about the direction of global governance itself. The oceans connect us all, and the decisions taken–or postponed–in one conference room can shape the future of industries, economies, and nations. For India, the choice is stark: to drift with the tide of hesitation or to steer with purpose toward a cleaner, fairer maritime future.

Three percent of climate change, the IMO maintains, is attributable to global shipping.
But while the United Nations has backed off for now, the measure will be on the table again sometime next year.
It will also block voluntary U.S. contributions to the United Nations if the organization levies a carbon tax on shipping.","The United States earned its independence by fighting a war to protest various indignities imposed by the crown, including levies that prompted the colonist slogan ""taxation without representation."" Those at the United Nations seeking to implement a global money grab through shipping taxes might be wise to re-examine history.

Last week, the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization tabled a proposal to create a global tax on carbon emissions derived from international maritime activity. The plan, which would raise up to $15 billion annually, was hatched by European nations and Brazil under the guise of fighting global warming by getting the maritime sector down to ""net zero"" by 2050. Three percent of climate change, the IMO maintains, is attributable to global shipping.

But the proposal met fierce resistance from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Trump threatened to retaliate against countries that supported the tax and to withhold U.S. funding from the United Nations if it enacted the plan. In advance of the tabled vote, the president took to social media to declare that the United States would ""not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.""

Good. The tax would represent a massive drag on global commerce and would burden American consumers with billions in higher costs despite never having been approved by any of their elected representatives in Washington. Taxation without representation, indeed. The net-zero pipe dream is an economic albatross that undercuts markets in favor of bureaucratic central planning and has already crippled the European Union. Trump did the Europeans a favor, saving them from themselves.

But while the United Nations has backed off for now, the measure will be on the table again sometime next year. Enter Rep. August Pfluger, a Texas Republican, who proposes legislation to ensure that the United States not be subject to a U.N. tax or penalty unless the Senate approves such a measure. It will also block voluntary U.S. contributions to the United Nations if the organization levies a carbon tax on shipping.

""This legislation,"" Rep. Pfluger told Fox News last week, ""would kill their global carbon tax scheme permanently by depriving all U.S. funding to any U.N. agency that attempts to impose a tax on the American people and ensuring Congress has a say in all taxes, fees and penalties on American citizens or companies.""

Rep. Pfluger's legislation protects Americans from overreaching U.N. bureaucrats. Congress should pass his bill once the government shutdown ends.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.newstribune.com_default.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:49.898472

These vessels, which account for approximately 85 percent of the international shipping industry’s carbon dioxide emissions, would be required to meet annual GHG fuel intensity targets or offset excess emissions through banked credits, purchases from other ships, or contributions to a new IMO Net-Zero Fund. The framework aligns with the IMO’s 2023 Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, aiming for a 40 percent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 and net-zero emissions close to 2050.

The Postponement and Increasing Political Pressures

The IMO’s most recent extraordinary MEPC session ended without adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework after a motion to adjourn proposed by Saudi Arabia, which passed by a narrow margin of votes. The adjournment followed heightened political pressure and shifting positions among key Member States, including vigorous opposition by the Trump administration. On October 10, 2025, days before the extraordinary MEPC session, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy issued a Joint Statement “unequivocally reject[ing]” the IMO Net-Zero Framework and encouraging other nations to reject the adoption of the new measures at the then-upcoming session.[1] Although the Trump administration’s stance on the measures does not come as a surprise, given that U.S. delegates exited the April session early and did not participate in the vote, the Joint Statement goes so far as to threaten retaliatory actions against nations that supported the measures at the October extraordinary MEPC session, including:

“Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the [IMO Net-Zero Framework];

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.” [2]

According to news reports of the extraordinary MEPC session, several countries that had previously backed the measures, and approved the IMO Net-Zero Framework in April 2025, abstained or changed their votes. EU members Greece and Cyprus, home to major shipping fleets, abstained. China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, switched from supporting the measure in April to voting for the delay. Other opponents included major fossil fuel producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, many of which have argued that the IMO Net-Zero Framework sows global division and overlooks the potential economic impacts on citizens and economies. Major shipping nations such as Singapore and Liberia also objected.

The criticism of the framework focuses primarily on lack of sufficient supply for clean fuels that would meet the IMO Net-Zero Framework’s GHG intensity targets. Currently, while cooking-oil derived maritime fuels have the potential to meet the framework’s targets, supply constraints mean that these fuels will not be available in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, raising the risk of financial penalties that could ultimately drive up consumer costs in an era of persistent inflation. When coupled with pressure from certain groups to exclude soy and palm-oil based maritime fuels from the framework, until costs come down for the production of e-fuels, some countries and groups see significant compliance challenges in the near-term. Similarly, although the IMO Net-Zero Framework incorporates a credit-purchasing system as a compliance pathway, recent studies call into question the availability of these credits to meet demand given the limited ability to bank credits for future years and the lack of fuels capable of meeting the IMO’s GHG intensity targets. Additionally, while the framework contemplates investment in port modernization/electrification and supporting low carbon fuel production using funds generated from the credit system, projected revenues do not appear sufficient help scale next generation low carbon fuels for the shipping industry at this time.

What to Watch Ahead of 2026

Despite the adjournment, technical work on the IMO Net‑Zero Framework continues. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships is expected to continue developing detailed guidelines for implementing the IMO Net-Zero Framework. The guidelines were originally expected to be approved at the 84th session of the MEPC in Spring 2026, but it is not clear whether the Intersessional Working Group is still working towards that goal. Over the next year, Member States are expected to pursue consensus-building, and the extraordinary session is set to reconvene around October 2026. If adopted at that time, the IMO Net-Zero Framework could still potentially enter into force for reporting year 2028, though this timeline is now uncertain.

The one-year delay is likely to amplify the existing uncertainty for the shipping industry, as there will be increased pressure from nations opposed to the measures to abandon or roll back the measures as previously approved. On the other hand, with global efforts on pause, there is increased risk of incremental or overlapping regional regimes to address GHG emissions from shipping. Stakeholders should monitor developments that could advance independently during the adjournment and consider potential interactions with any future IMO mechanism.

We will continue monitoring developments related to the proposed framework. Please reach out to your Vinson & Elkins team to discuss these matters and their implications for your business.

“The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn't stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick.
“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation.","London, 24 October 2025:- As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO Member States for rising above last week’s rancour - when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year - by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear - this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, said Delaine McCullough, Clean Shipping Coalition president. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, said John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO. “By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

“While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

“This week's meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples Rights and community well being of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “Despite the implementation delay of the IMO's GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.""

“Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn't stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

“The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation. This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 23:16:31.836241

Back in the day, about the only time you would come across a robustly and publicly displayed America First message would be when traveling rural, mostly southern highways, when suddenly from the trees would pop out a brightly lettered John Birch Society call to action: “Get US Out of the United Nations!”

If only we had listened. Back then such a proposition was considered to be as far out of the mainstream as the back roads along which the pop-ups appeared, but in recent years the idea has become serious currency, especially in the America First movement. As well it should. Grassroots conservatives across America understand in their guts and hearts the dangers the United Nations and its affiliate organizations pose to the United States and to liberty.

The problem is, even though the imperatives of nationalism travel these days along slick silicon interstates rather than homesteading along abandoned rustic roads, our political leaders, including more than a few conservatives, continue to blink and miss them. It is as if they are driving blindfolded, or have fallen asleep, on their way to one global political crisis after another.

That they need to wake up—it’s always dangerous to drive with your eyes closed—was underscored just this past week when the Trump administration had to undertake a full court press to derail a UN globalist carbon tax that would have devastated the country’s shipping industry and imposed severe costs upon American consumers, all without any input from U.S. citizens.

The Wall Street Journal called it the ultimate taxation without representation, a levy imposed without any democratic accountability. It is just the latest but quintessential example of how the UN frustrates and defeats national sovereignty; how it commits our nation to a redistribution of wealth away from its own people; how it ties the hand of future voters and their elected representatives; how it confiscates our hard-earned dollars at will.

It is the latest demonstration of why the United States needs to get out of the UN immediately, and to run in the opposite direction as fast as it can.

The Shipping News

Let’s get to all that by first examining the specifics of the now-postponed (for one year) carbon tax on shipping vessels.

For the past several years and possibly longer, the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) has worked diligently to erect a so-called “Net-Zero Framework” that would effectively impose a global tax on fossil-fuel emissions from ocean shipping—the first ever across an entire sector—complete with remedial payments into a central fund.

Its architects have celebrated it as a necessary piece of climate housekeeping and, as late as last week, expected the IMO’s governing body to enact it. The ostensible idea was to decarbonize the shipping industry by requiring all oceangoing ships exceeding 5,000 gross tonnage to track their emissions using a Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which measures the amount of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions per unit of used energy.

Ah, the old Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), that will get you every time. Specifically, starting in 2028, large international vessels would have had to use a fuel mix containing much less carbon or get tagged for $100 per ton or $380 per ton of CO2 emissions. The gross-tonnage threshold would have covered vessels responsible for roughly 85 percent of the international shipping industry’s CO2 emissions. Ships meeting a direct-compliance target would have escaped the levy altogether; those falling between a base and direct-compliance target would have been charged $100 per ton, while non-compliant vessels faced a $380-per-ton penalty.

Bottom line, the IMO expected to collect $10-$12 billion per year for a Net-Zero Fund for various green energy investments.

Now this is where it all gets kind of wacky, or murky, or shady—one of those ‘y’ words. Proponents of the IMO strategy will tell you otherwise, that the fund use is highly regulated and use of the funds strictly delineated, but in fact the use of the central fund was loosely defined, meaning bureaucrats could, in the IMO’s own words, invest in new low-emission ships, upgrade port infrastructure, support island states threatened by rising sea levels, or support—wait for it— “just transition initiatives in developing countries.”

Wealth redistribution that they could use for just about anything, if I may translate the last permitted use. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it on X, it would have been a slush fund for “progressive climate pet projects.”

As might be expected, the scheme did not get past one Donald J. Trump, who wrote on social media:

Rubio, Duffy, and Wright cited estimates forecasting global shipping costs to rise by 10 percent or more because of the carbon tax.

“The NZF (Net Zero Fund) proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided,” the secretaries continued. “The United States will be moving to levy remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. … Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Neo-colonial was a nice touch, by the way, though I prefer regulatory imperialism, not to split hairs.

Member states did blink after the administration’s missive. The IMO punted—delaying action for a year after a motion to adjourn carried on a tight vote, with 57 countries supporting the delay, 49 opposed, and 21 abstaining.

Unfortunately, the pattern of the entire scheme was a familiar one. A global body constructs an elaborate revenue scheme in the name of climate, development, or justice; costs flow to wealthier developed nations; power accretes to the bureaucracy; and the world’s largest payer—the United States—is asked, yet again, to fund its own sacrifice to the globalist gods. It should be pointed out, too, that estimates performed in 2024 show that the emissions reductions that would have been achieved by 2030 were well short of the IMO’s target of 20 percent; the most reliable estimate was 8 percent. This after massive revenue extraction from American consumers.

And that tells us all we need to know about the motive for the tax. But don’t take my word for it. A 2024 analysis of low-carbon fuels by World Economic Forum strategic partner Deloitte Global explained it all: “Reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires a fundamental transformation of society, from its current fossil fuel-centric model to an efficient, highly renewable and electrified energy system.”

This is exactly how globalism works in the modern world. It identifies an existential world-wide crisis; concocts an elaborate supranational mechanism to exploit it; and then treats democratic resistance as a moral failure. The effect—intended—is to make national sovereignty look small-minded and backward, even selfish, while elevating rule by acronymic bodies you never voted for and cannot abolish.

Even worse, the shipping tax isn’t a one-off; it’s the role model. Cue the aviation industry next.

Forever yours, my lovely forever wars

What all this points out is that UN action, by default, is an intrusion on sovereignty. It does not represent agreements negotiated between nations by the people’s elected representatives but rather ideological edicts dreamed up by unelected bureaucrats, rubber-stamped by ambassadors of the global elite.

The intent is to bind nations to a global chassis in which decision-making migrates away from voters and toward international bodies, “experts,” and permanent institutions. The only sovereignty is the sovereignty of those permanent institutions. These insentient and corporatized bureaucracies do not just tax but, through redistribution, come to own and control the wealth of the world. The compilation of their visions into holy screeds of international “frameworks” and “treaties” is the only vote-counting that matters.

There is another vital consequence of this, one so often overlooked: The era of the United Nations is also the era of Forever Wars, and that is no coincidence. According to Uppsala/PRIO data, the number of active state-based conflicts reached 59 in 2023 involving 34 countries and 61 in 2024—the highest since records began in 1946—underscoring how the post-1945 UN era features more simultaneous conflicts than earlier decades. UCDP is a highly credible program of Uppsala University in Sweden that tracks organized violence, while the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) is an independent research organization that compiles reports on such things as global conflict trends.

The history of the UN, which was created to keep the international peace, is a history of violent bloodshed and unleashed military industrial complexes, not to mention brutal civil wars. The hegemony of the international power structure might have reduced interstate conflicts, at least until recently, but globalization and the destabilization of the nation-state promoted intrastate warfare mercilessly.

In the end, there’s a simple test for any institution that claims to keep the peace: Does it keep the peace?

The United Nations has spent eight decades proving that it can’t, and it admits it. Just recently, the United Nations chief sharply criticized the powerful but deeply divided UN security council for its failure to end wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more: “Peace demands action,” secretary-general Antonio Guterres told the 15-member council charged with ensuring international peace and security. “And peace demands leadership. Instead, we’re seeing deepening geopolitical divisions and mistrust.”

Far from taking action, UN groupies sing karaoke against a backdrop of international ballads of justice while warmongers paralyze any and all international tribunals for peace. Meanwhile, wars multiply, and American taxpayers pick up the bar tab. The truth is, the best deterrence to war is the existence of strong sovereign nations with their own national interests to protect and that are not cowed by fear of ridicule or admonishment by others. On the other hand, the international bureaucratization of governance breaks down the checks and balances that strong sovereign nations provide against the consolidation of international power.

More recently, there is another reason globalism does not deter but fuel war—it has now concentrated power in a globalist class that seeks hegemony over the world but does not have it. They are other globalist power cliques who seek the same domination, namely Russia and China and their allies, and they are the competition against Brussels and Davos.

That contest explains the Russia-Ukraine war as much as anything, along with the Biden regime’s weak submission to globalist dictats and provocations. While individual nations are no longer allowed under international “frameworks” to march to the beats of their own drummers, either for defense or for war, they are expected to engage on the front lines immediately when the globalist regime comes calling.

Trump’s speech was a defense of sovereignty and borders, a rejection of the “green energy scam,” and a reminder that deterrence—power responsibly wielded by accountable governments—stops violence in ways that war-crime tribunals and security council vetoes never can. In his speech Trump laid out for the assembled puppecrats what a truly sovereign nation—what a strong leader committed to sustaining that sovereignty—can accomplish.

“America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships, and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth,” Trump said. “This is indeed the Golden Age of America.”

Four months in a row, the president said, the number of illegal aliens admitted and entering the U.S. had been zero.

“In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven ‘un-endable’ wars,” he said. “No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country, has ever done anything close to that. It’s too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them—and sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help.”

Trump—and all of us—know exactly what the UN thinks its purpose is: to fund an assault on our countries and our way of life. And so he drilled down finally to the real evil:

“The entire globalist concept of asking successful, industrialized nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies must be rejected completely and totally, and it must be immediate.”

Sadly, the accounts payable for all this keeps rising. Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center ran the numbers. In 2025 the United States accounted for about 22 percent of the U.N.’s regular budget—roughly $820 million of a $3.5 billion net total—and more than 26.2 percent of the so-calledpeacekeeping budget. China was the next-largest contributor to the regular budget, Japan a distant third.

One hundred seventy-five member states each pay under 1 percent of the regular budget. So when American taxpayers express skepticism about underwriting institutions that scold our allies, cuddle our adversaries, and demand that we fund our own demise, that skepticism is not isolationism, it is a desire for survival.

It is a demand for liberty.

The need for a united nation—no ‘s’

Trump has indeed signaled his withdrawal from important parts of the globalist infrastructure in his nine months back in office.

The president has signed an executive order to initiate U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and the WHO, and in February 2025 he issued an order directing the government to reevaluate its commitment to three major U.N. bodies: the UN Human Rights Council (from which the U.S. will withdraw), UNESCO (which will be reviewed), and UNRWA (to which U.S. funds will be cut).

America First congressional leaders have also honed in on the UN and its affiliated organizations. This past year, for example, Wisconsin’s own U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, now a candidate for governor, has been one of the clearest voices pushing hard against U.N. overreach, especially through the World Health Organization. His “No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act” would force any WHO agreement to win a Senate supermajority approval, putting treaty power where it belongs.

Tiffany has also pushed to revisit our World Trade Organization membership.

“The WTO has repeatedly overlooked China’s unfair trade practices and human rights abuses, undermined American farmers and manufacturers, and eroded our national sovereignty,” Tiffany said. “American trade policies should be made by American officials who are elected by American voters and accountable to American workers, not dictated by unelected international bureaucrats in Geneva. It’s time to pursue a better approach to trade—one that puts American industry, jobs, and economic independence first.”

Amen, brother.

Behind all the numbers is a political truth: the people of the United States are fed up with funding a system that undermines American sovereignty while failing to achieve its advertised goals, even though our leaders appear not so courageous.

Of course all of America First knows what the next step needs to be, and that is complete withdrawal from the UN, precisely because cutting off its limbs—IMO, WTO, WHO—will never slay the beast if its heart is left to beat another day. In January, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced the Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act of 2025, in essence a bill seeking a divorce decree based on irreconcilable differences.

“No more blank checks for the United Nations,” Lee said. “Americans’ hard-earned dollars have been funneled into initiatives that fly in the face of our values, enabling tyrants, betraying allies, and spreading bigotry,” Lee said.

Elon Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to downsize the US government, has also publicly supported US withdrawal.

So where does that leave us? Well, with a straightforward policy program.

First, end the insanity. Withdraw from the United Nations and its affiliate dependent agencies, as Lee’s DEFUND bill would do. Second, build real alliances with other sovereign nations through concrete agreements designed and approved by elected officials. The difference between a treaty ratified by the Senate and a “framework” imposed by a U.N. body is the difference between democracy and authoritarianism. Tiffany’s WHO approach gets this exactly right.

Third, defend borders, and build energy security and industry at home. We must reject an environmentalism that transfers power from voters to bureaucrats, and from free economies to commanded ones.

Trump’s U.N. speech asked one of the right questions: What is the purpose of the United Nations? We all knew what the honest answer was. But the shipping-tax fight brings to light an even more important question for all Americans to consider:

What is the purpose of a sovereign United States?

We all know the answer to that, too. It is to protect our liberty and values and culture, and, by being strong, to keep the peace. Sovereign strength deters, and only sovereign strength delivers longevity.

The unity of nations was always a misnomer, double-speak for the unified power of an elite. What we need is the unity of a nation, not in policy but in purpose. The map to get there is out there on a rural road somewhere, faded but visible yet on an aging but still-standing sign calling us to action: Get the U.S. out of the United Nations!

We can still make that sign proud.",https://www.maciverinstitute.com/assets/components/phpthumbof/cache/united-nations-seal.542bbc6eb4cf186158fda16aaf5af3cb.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 21:56:10.413980

From fuel discussions to wind propulsion demonstrations, maritime training showcases and Clean Maritime Day exhibitions, University of Southampton and SMMI colleagues took part in a diverse programme of activity at LISW25. They represented the University, sharing research and building connections across the maritime community. Their presence throughout the week reflected the University’s growing role in shaping sustainable shipping, from advancing technical innovation to contributing to national and international policy discussions.

Powering Maritime Innovation

On Tuesday, 16 September, Professor Alan J Murphy delivered a keynote at Powering Maritime Innovation: Towards a UK Research Roadmap, highlighting key UK maritime research challenges and the importance of coordinated innovation. Alan also gave closing remarks as MarRI-UK Academic Chair, stressing the role of international collaboration in supporting the transition to net-zero shipping

That evening, Professor Mark Spearing , Vice-President of Research and Enterprise, represented the University of Southampton at the Investment Reception hosted by His Majesty’s Government, in partnership with Maritime UK, at Mansion House. The event brought together industry leaders, institutional investors, Government Ministers, and international ambassadors to celebrate the UK maritime sector’s contribution to economic growth.

Hydrogen Fuel for the Maritime Sector

On Wednesday, 17 September, Panos Manias represented the SMMI at MarRI-UK’s event on hydrogen as a clean maritime fuel. Panos explored hydrogen’s potential in decarbonising shipping and enabling next-generation uncrewed systems.

That same day, Panos also joined industry and policy leaders at the ShipZERO30 – HyWindships conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Hosted by the Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association (ZESTAs), the event focused on real-world progress toward zero-emission shipping, bringing together innovators advancing hydrogen, electrification, and wind propulsion technologies.

Later that evening, Panos and Professor Stephen Turnock represented the University at the Maritime Innovation Networking and Drinks event hosted by ACUA Ocean in partnership with the University of Southampton and MarRI-UK. The gathering at St Katharine Docks showcased ACUA Ocean’s hydrogen-powered autonomous vessel, the USV Pioneer, and offered guests a close-up look at emerging technologies redefining clean, crewless operations at sea.

Solent: A Global Centre for Maritime Training and Skills

Also on 17 September, Maritime Solent hosted the Solent – A Global Centre for Maritime Training and Skills session, attended by Rosemary Nunn, Head of Industry Relations at the University of Southampton. The event highlighted the Solent region’s unique maritime training ecosystem and its collaboration between universities, colleges, and industry.

The launch of the new Solent Prospectus showcased this global leadership in maritime excellence, featuring institutions such as the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, National Oceanography Centre, Royal Navy, Lloyd’s Register, and the University of Southampton.

Wind Propulsion and Clean Maritime Day

On Wednesday afternoon, Professor Dominic Hudson and Dr Joe Banks attended the Wind Propulsion Session hosted by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and the International Windship Association. With more than 160 delegates, the event underscored the growing momentum behind wind-assisted propulsion and the UK’s leadership in developing the technologies that will drive its adoption across global fleets.

On Thursday, 18 September, SMMI engineers and collaborators showcased the Winds of Change project at Innovate UK’s Clean Maritime Day, as part of the Smart Green Shipping exhibition. Visitors to Stand 11 explored sustainable wind propulsion technologies and engaged with industry leaders on low-carbon shipping innovations. We were pleased to discuss the potential of wind propulsion technology with the new shipping minister, Keir Mather , and to show him our wind tunnel exhibit.

It was good to see the University’s logo on at least two other stands and to talk with all of our industry partners about past and future projects.

The event also highlighted the role of public investment and policy in accelerating the clean maritime transition, with updates from the Department for Transport and Innovate UK on UK SHORE and the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.

Advanced Fuels and Future Concepts

Throughout LISW25, University of Southampton representatives engaged with sessions on alternative fuels, including focus on ammonia as a marine fuel and the ÆQUORIS roundtable on zero-emission LH2-powered ocean liners. These discussions focused on technical feasibility, regulatory frameworks, and collaboration opportunities for long-range sustainable shipping.

The discussions around hydrogen, ammonia and future vessel concepts underscored a central challenge: how to test and de-risk new fuels and technologies at scale, quickly enough to meet net zero targets. That is precisely the gap the University of Southampton is addressing through its recently announced Centre for Green Maritime Innovation (cGMI). Bringing together industry, regulators and researchers, the cGMI is being established to enable full-scale trials and accelerate the adoption of clean technologies.

By linking technical breakthroughs with real-world deployment, the centre will play a critical role in ensuring the UK can lead the global race to decarbonise shipping - an ambition that ran throughout London International Shipping Week.",,N,,2025-10-24 19:16:36.242517

Following the heated Net-Zero Framework debate the previous week, the meeting carried an unmistakable buzz. Then Erik Hjortland entered the stage and caught the attention with a clear message: the pathway to net-zero shipping is already within reach.

Real results from real operations

Odfjell’s chemical tanker Bow Olympus completed a transatlantic voyage earlier this year, powered by a dual propulsion solution: suction sails on deck, 100% waste-based, ISCC-certified biofuel meeting both IMO and the EU’s sustainability criteria in the bunker tanks.

The goal was to demonstrate the GHG reductions possible by utilizing options available here and now. The results might have surprised even the most hardcore optimists at Odfjell: it achieved a 20% consumption reduction due to the sails, and 85% reduction in well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions due to the sustainable biofuel.

A scalable pathway

Scalability-wise, our VP Technology referred to DNV's 2023 research, which estimates a sufficient availability of sustainable biomass beyond 2050—for all sectors, including shipping. The supply estimates are cross-checked with 26 other reliable and credible sources, which show that DNV's predictions are quite conservative. The significance of this pathway is that it does not require capex, and as such, one can argue that the entire shipping fleet today is net-zero capable.

We have reduced the carbon intensity of our fleet by 54% since the 2008 benchmark through systematic efficiency improvements, including retrofitting of more than 140 energy-saving devices such as propeller upgrades, hull optimization, propeller ducts, LED lights, and sails. These measures have not only reduced emissions but also generated annual fuel cost savings of USD 20-30 million.

In contrast, 67% of the world fleet has not installed a single energy-saving device (according to Clarkson Research, 2024), leaving an enormous untapped potential for further emission reductions in the industry—and cost savings.

“We cannot energy-efficiency ourselves to zero, but we can get very far, very fast—and sustainable biofuels and wind power can take us the rest of the way,” Erik said. “With 10,000 tonnes of sustainable biofuel bunkered this year and more to come, we’re not just talking —we’re doing.”",https://st-484u2x1fcj.nf.cdn.netflexapp.com/media/l/1200x630/1761306646/5044-cd605195-9591-4d64-a640-5dec10ced726.JPG,N,,2025-10-24 18:00:35.671824

The ISWG-GHG-20 meeting saw governments engage in discussions on the framework’s guidelines, a contrast to the chaotic negotiations the week before that led to the adoption delay.
Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which experts say must be equitable to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition.
“Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions,” Shaw said.
IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez encouraged leaders to view the delay as a pause on adoption, not on the underlying work.","The International Maritime Organization continued work on its Net-Zero Framework at working group talks in London this week, despite voting to postpone the framework’s adoption by one year just days earlier.

The NZF contains the world’s first global greenhouse gas pricing system for shipping, i.e. a carbon tax, designed to help the industry achieve its 2023 Revised Strategy goals of achieving net zero emissions by or around 2050. The framework’s carbon pricing revenues are expected to reach up to $15 billion annually from 2030.

The ISWG-GHG-20 meeting saw governments engage in discussions on the framework’s guidelines, a contrast to the chaotic negotiations the week before that led to the adoption delay.

Countries disagreed sharply on the role of biofuels in shipping’s transition. Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushed for a “technology neutral” approach favoring existing biofuel sources including food and feed stock like soy and palm oil. The EU and Pacific Island states opposed this position, citing sustainability and scalability concerns, and favored renewable e-fuels as a long-term solution.

Researchers, civil society groups and international campaigners have warned against using food and feed-based biofuels on environmental, climate and human rights grounds. Mexico, the UK and several Pacific Islands expressed support for addressing these concerns through Life Cycle Assessment guidelines that account for indirect land-use change emissions. The LCA guidelines are set to be finalized in April 2026.

Member states and industry expressed broad support for including wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero energy source alongside solar and shore power.

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which experts say must be equitable to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition.

The US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries objected to further work on the guidelines, calling it premature until the NZF is adopted. Several delegates noted that these same countries had argued the previous week that the NZF could not be adopted due to missing policy clarifications.

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at T&E, said the framework’s success will depend on strong guidance that incentivizes green e-fuel production while safeguarding against unsustainable fuels like crop-based biofuels. “Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions,” Shaw said.

Next Steps

The IMO will reconvene for technical working group talks from April 20-24, 2026, followed by the 84th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee from April 27 to May 1.

MEPC 84 is planned to finalize decisions on clean energy under the NZF, including the LCA guidelines, which are essential for evaluating the environmental impact of marine fuels and determining vessels’ compliance with the framework.

Days after the IMO delay, more than 200 industry leaders gathered in Antwerp for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit, where participants reported feeling “hopeful and energised” despite the setback. IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez encouraged leaders to view the delay as a pause on adoption, not on the underlying work. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” Dominguez said.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-11T050025Z_666471803_RC2G9V9UXH5H_RTRMADP_3_SHIPPING-EMISSIONS-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:16:27.629962

The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” Prior to the meeting, the United States’ opposition was well known.","The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) met in London October 14–17 with the primary purpose of voting on the group’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), presented to the committee for review in June. The framework is a set of directives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from maritime vessels more than 5,000 gross tons.

On the one hand, the new framework would only apply to international, ocean-going vessels. Language within the NZF excludes vessels “solely engaged in voyages within waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the State (country),” including the inland waterways of the United States.

But that’s not the full story. The framework also states that “each party should ensure, by the adoption of appropriate measures, that such ships act in a manner consistent with the requirements of [the framework], so far as is reasonable and practicable.”

The downstream intent of the framework, then, which is to create new and varied fuels, multiple new bunkering, handling and transfer requirements and appropriate safeguards for transport and storage, doesn’t stop at coastal ports. To the extent that new fuels and port-side systems prove workable, the market for those services could move inland, although likely without the IMO-related fees and reporting system for international ships.

When the October 14–17 “extraordinary” MEPC meeting was scheduled, there was nothing particularly noteworthy on the agenda. It was just an “extra” meeting outside of MEPC’s usual schedule.

However, the unexpected outcome of the meeting proved quite extraordinary.

MEPC was widely expected to endorse the NZF, and a vote in favor of the framework would have started the development of an extensive and complicated set of rules covering alternative fuels, ship registrations, record keeping, enforcement, payments and the administration of a new worldwide fund to receive and disburse those payments. Procedurally, the IMO’s 176 member states (countries) would have singularly enforced the regulatory components within the framework.

A vote to approve the framework, though, did not happen. Instead, the committee voted to delay its decision on the framework for one year. Many supporters blamed behind-the-scenes efforts by the United States and Saudi Arabia. However, comments from delegates presented during lengthy open-floor sessions revealed broad opposition to and concerns about the framework.

When the MEPC convened for its last session on October 17, the committee voted 57 to 49 (not including abstentions and absent delegates) to “adjourn the extraordinary session for one year.”

On the one hand, the delay could undercut companies that have already made decisions and investments to move to “green” fuels. For companies and countries opposed to the framework—like the United States—the delay offers an opportunity to work to strengthen opposition. Beyond that, the legality for IMO to levee a carbon tax is in question.

Vocal U.S. Opposition

The night before MEPC’s vote to delay adoption of the framework, President Donald Trump posted on social media that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax. The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Prior to the meeting, the United States’ opposition was well known. The State Department, along with other Cabinet-level agencies, criticized the NZF many times, starting at least in August, and during the MEPC meeting. On October 15, in a statement posted on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the administration’s concerns that the United Nations was attempting to pass the first global carbon tax that would result in increased energy, food and fuel costs. Rubio stated the United States’ vote “will be a hard no” and asked other nations to stand alongside the United States “in defense of our citizens and sovereignty.”

Rubio’s post on X also referenced an October 14 Wall Street Journal editorial titled “The United Nations Is About to Tax You.” Regarding the new framework fund, which would be financed by carbon fees, the Wall Street Journal opined that “if you think handouts to non-democratic countries for vaguely defined ‘climate’ purposes will be administered scrupulously in the public interest, we’ve got a carbon-neutral barge to sell you.”

As drafted, the framework would set two main demands.

First, it would establish a global fuel standard for ships more than 5,000 gross tons to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle. Second, it would establish a pricing mechanism—or fee—linked to emissions “to encourage the industry to lower emissions to comply with the global fuel standard.” The fee would start in 2028 at $100 per ton of carbon emitted. As proposed, that rate would increase in 2030 to $380 per ton, with the possibility of further review and rate hikes.

At just 12 pages, the Net Zero Framework is one chapter within the United Nations’ entire 125-page maritime pollution (MARPOL) document titled the “International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.”

Many MEPC delegates questioned whether support for the framework would automatically mean support for future developments. The NZF draft text presents broad ideas, but many of those ideas include the footnote, “Refer to guidelines to be developed by the organization.” The framework contains 28 similar footnotes, and some of those reference existing rules “that may be amended.”

“Equity” among nations, particularly small and developing nations, is another concern raised by opponents and acknowledged within the draft text itself. The draft directs “the committee” to address “disproportionately negative impacts of this chapter on food security” with “particular attention paid to countries exposed to food insecurity.”

MEPC delegates from smaller or developing countries expressed concern about being left behind due to their inability to afford compliance with the framework’s demands. They also worry that the NZF would increase transport costs so much that they would be unable to afford the cost of importing food and medical supplies.

Efforts To Stay On Track

During a news conference on Tuesday, October 14, after the MEPC’s opening session, one of the first questions for IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez referred to opposition from the United States. In reply, Dominguez said he would not address issues regarding an individual country.

“I’m working with all the countries,” he said, adding that his role is “to assist the process. Every country has the right to express their opinion, and we are listening to all the points of view.”

During his closing remarks October 17, Dominguez asked delegates to continue to be proactive.

“Let’s all take this moment to learn from this [and] come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to address the goals which were set in the 2023 GHG strategy that you all agreed to,” Dominguez said. “As we come to an end, I ask you for one favor. Let’s not celebrate. There are concerns we need to address. Let’s work with each other.”

Joe Kramek, president and CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC), in response to questions via email, called the framework “a serious, effective plan that gives countries and industry a clear path to decarbonize shipping, the result of years of careful discussions. The agreement may not give all parties exactly what they desire, but that was never the objective. The objective is to decarbonize global ocean supply chains by 2050, in a way that is as fair and cost-effective as possible for the world’s nations.”

Kramek added that “the IMO proposal is the only framework that makes [the objective] possible. It applies fairly and globally across the sector, sets clear targets and backs them up with a financial measure that puts shipping on track to reach net zero around 2050.”

But the assertion of a clear, equitable and workable path forward for the NZF is at the heart of the controversy. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), in a report titled “Vision Meets Reality,” offered a much more cautious conclusion.

“Shipping is not yet aligned with the IMO trajectory,” ABS stated in the report. “Emissions remain above the 2008 baseline, compliance costs are compounding, and the signals shaping investment—regulation, fuel pricing, penalties, availability, scalability—are moving at different speeds. The risk is clear: the industry could end up monetizing carbon without actually delivering decarbonization.”

Reflecting those concerns, MEPC decided that a closer look at the framework—and a 12-month delay—was the best path forward.",https://www.waterwaysjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WJDefaultShareFB.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 14:01:40.978117

IMO Spotlights Gender, Decarbonization at WISTA Event

IMO participated in the WISTA International Annual General Meeting and Conference held in Barcelona, Spain (20-24 October), under the theme ""Powering the Future of Shipping & Trade: Global Energy in Challenging Times"".

Gender equality was a central focus throughout the conference, reflecting IMO's ongoing cooperation with WISTA International to promote diversity and leadership opportunities across the maritime industry.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Domínguez took part in two key sessions: a roundtable on Decarbonization: Impacts on Shipping, Cruise, and Energy Industries, and a closing fireside chat with the CEO of The American Club, Ms. Dorothea Ioanno. He emphasized the importance of collaboration among governments, shipowners and innovators to advance the maritime sector's transition toward low-and zero-carbon fuels. The conversation highlighted the importance of seafarer well-being and addressing seafarer criminalization, the challenges of recruitment and gender balance, and the role of the IMO in promoting gender equality.

IMO Deputy Director for Planning and Programming, Ms. Louise Proctor, in a session on ""IMO-WISTA International partnership update"", stressed that data-driven initiatives are key to designing effective policies that promote inclusivity and leadership opportunities. ""This partnership is about action, not just awareness,"" she said. ""Together, we are building an ocean of opportunity for women in maritime.""

The second IMO-WISTA Women in Maritime Survey provides the first global dataset on women's participation in both public and private maritime sectors. The survey, published in May 2025, shows that women currently account for just under 19% of the total workforce, representing 176,820 individuals in 2024, up from 151,979 in 2021. Women make up 19% of the workforce in national maritime authorities and 16% in the private sector workforce (excluding seafarers). At sea, however, women remain vastly underrepresented, comprising only 1% of seafarers of the respondees. Meanwhile, 5% of students pursuing seafaring degrees are women, highlighting that more women are entering maritime education than are transitioning into seafaring careers.

The next IMO-WISTA Women in Maritime Survey will be conducted in 2027. Looking ahead to this next edition, the goal remains clear: to raise the bar for gender equality, transparency and opportunity across the global maritime community. Ms. Proctor encouraged widespread participation in the forthcoming survey across the public and private sectors to provide a comparable dataset that helps us identify gaps, measure progress, and design initiatives that respond to real needs, not assumptions.

IMO has reinforced its commitment to gender representation through a series of recent initiatives, including the Global Strategy for the IMO Women in Maritime Associations 2024-2029 (approved by the TC Committee in June 2025), the Women's Leadership and Empowerment (WLE) training course in collaboration with the World Maritime University (WMU) and WISTA International and ongoing programs such as the SMART-C Women programme. Gender matters are a strategic priority in all IMO projects and technical cooperation work.

However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.
“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said.
However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy.
“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other.","The Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez, has acknowledged the disruption caused by the postponement of the vote on the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, describing last Friday’s session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) as “not a normal IMO meeting”.

Despite the setback, Dominguez emphasised that the organisation remains united in its mission and continues to make progress towards decarbonising the global shipping industry.

Speaking at the Women’s International Shipping & Trading Association (WISTA) Annual General Meeting and Conference in Barcelona, Dominguez addressed the fallout from the extraordinary MEPC session, which was expected to advance a landmark proposal for a global levy on greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.

The levy is central to the IMO’s plans to implement its 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy, which commits the sector to reaching net-zero emissions “by or around 2050”.

However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.

“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said. “We shouldn’t be rated as an organisation based on the postponement that took place, but instead on the fact that, like everybody else, we are dealing with different changes, different geopolitical situations, and we need to adapt.”

He added that the IMO had already resumed work on decarbonisation, with technical discussions beginning earlier this week to address key concerns raised during the meeting, including the management of the proposed climate fund, certification processes and the practicalities of implementation.

The proposed greenhouse gas levy is seen as one of the most significant measures in the IMO’s efforts to accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels and technologies.

Supporters argue that it would create a global financial mechanism to incentivise emission reductions while generating funds for developing countries to access low- and zero-carbon technologies.

However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy. Developing nations, led by China, India and several African countries, have expressed concerns that the mechanism could unfairly impact emerging economies and increase trade costs, while others — including many European and Pacific states — are pushing for a globally applied price on carbon emissions from ships.

Dominguez, who took office as IMO Secretary-General in January 2024, urged patience and diplomacy, stressing that consensus-building is at the heart of the organisation’s mandate.

“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other. Those that had different views were in the same room, and we’re not going to find agreements right away, because we need to understand those comments and address them with further discussions and data,” he said.

“That is how multilateralism continues to work, and it is at the centre of everything that we do at IMO. So again, a silver lining — the member states are talking to each other.”

The delay at MEPC has prompted criticism from some climate advocates who argue that the shipping sector — responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions — is moving too slowly to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

Yet Dominguez insisted that the IMO’s record over its 70-year history shows resilience and adaptability.

“It’s easy for critics to judge the IMO’s success based on the events of last week, but we have decades of progress behind us — improving safety, security and shipping’s environmental performance. We are a strong organisation with a large and relevant programme of work,” he stated.

UCL provides a detailed analysis of what happened and the implications on future adoption of the policy on mid-term measures for reducing GHG emissions

London 24th October 2025 – Two weeks of negotiations at the IMO give two confusingly different signals, as well as plenty of information on detail to digest, according to UCL (University College London) in their informative readout. In the first week the IMO’s efforts to adopt binding GHG measures in the form of the Net Zero Framework, agreed in principle in April, went backwards. Countries voted to defer the meeting and therefore the decision to adopt. There is now certainty that this regulation’s entry into effect will be delayed by 12 months to 1st January 2029, but there is also increased uncertainty that it will be adopted at all.

Although US and Saudi Arabian pressure was central, the full explanation for the significant shift in positions from April to October is difficult to decompose. Interventions by countries during negotiations offer some narrative and potential explanations, but all the underlying reasons are likely complex and may involve multiple interacting causes.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group said: “Instead of clarification, shipping and the global trade and energy systems now face significantly increased uncertainty and therefore risk. Understanding what happened at the IMO in October and why is now central not just for any chance of future adoption, but for just and equitable climate action generally. This lost momentum can be recovered, but we have taken a step closer to the abyss that is dangerous climate change.”

However, the second week of negotiations, the ISWG-GHG 20, made steady progress on the discussion of the detail for the regulation’s implementation. Many of the countries which had been negative towards adoption in the previous week were back to negotiating their preferences on all the key implementation details – how the regulation should incentivise energy transition, how the fund should be setup, how the lifecycle and sustainability of different fuels should be evaluated and certified.

Dr Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group said: “After last week’s challenges, this week’s intersessional negotiations were promising. We observed constructive participation from all parties — including those with prior concerns — which led to real progress on key technical guidelines. Even previously contentious topics, such as the Net Zero Fund, experienced broad and active involvement from many delegations, helping to clarify priorities like establishing the Governing Board and fundamental principles to guide the Fund’s future work.”

Beyond the overall outcome on adoption, the detailed discussions in ISWG-GHG 20 reveal some positive emerging perspectives that will form the basis of the guidelines. No decisions were taken to rule on detail either way, and so the ideas all move forwards to greater clarification.

Dr Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The past two weeks at the IMO sent mixed signals — while the adoption of the Net Zero Framework was delayed, detailed negotiations showed that most countries still see it as the right foundation for maritime decarbonisation, keeping the door open for meaningful progress in 2026.”

Zero Near Zero (ZNZ) definition – looks unlikely to go beyond the detail in the MARPOL amendment (e.g. the limit on GHG fuel intensity).

Reward mechanism – will remain fluid, although saw good support for differentiating rewards to different fuels. It was clear that member states see these guidelines as a priority and will likely work to clarify significantly during 2026.

Net Zero Fund – mixed signals from the member state interventions. Some were keen to move forwards with urgency and develop some initial governing provisions that would provide a minimum further clarity, but there was also opposition to this.

Lifecycle analysis (LCA) and certification – The question of sustainability criteria (an important issue for biofuel evaluation) was widely discussed, and is likely to see further attention alongside questions of environmental integrity and GHG emission accountancy.

Dr Marie Fricaudet, Research Fellow at UCL Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The industry now faces increased investment uncertainty: regulatory uncertainty from the IMO (timing and stringency of the NZF); from the concrete implementation of the guidelines which will have a large impact on fuels and technologies’ competitiveness and prices; but also from the space it opens for more disparate regional and private initiatives to fill the gap left by the IMO in the meantime.”

The IMO Secretariat also offered the working group a bit of insight into the status of the NZF, according to LR.","A coalition of non-governmental organisations following the progress of environmental regulations under discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London have claimed that constructive dialogue remains underway on guidelines to support the yet-to-be-adopted measure which would add teeth to a general international agreement to decarbonise shipping operations.

An extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adjourned on 17 October 2025 without adopting a landmark treaty that could have – and may still – become the first legally-binding global rules setting out technical and economic measures that would lead an industry down a timeline of targets to decarbonise operations to the point of net zero.

Under discussion were additions to the maritime pollution treaty, Marpol, that includes the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). The NZF is made up of two main decarbonisation requirements: a global fuel standard to move away from heavily polluting fuels and a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism, often referred to as a carbon tax.

Allegations of behind-the-scenes diplomatic pressure tactics from the United States during the MEPC meeting surfaced in news reports that followed a vote to delay discussions to approve the amendment to the maritime pollution treaty by a year. Back-channel negotiations were also referenced during proceedings, including a mention by the chair of the MEPC, as ’corridor diplomacy’.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear – this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, Clean Shipping Coalition president Delaine McCullough said.

“During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

NGO Transport & Environment’s IMO manager Dr Alison Shaw said the negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines for the NZF despite a lack of certainty about the future of the regulations.

In its report on the progress of the working group, UK-based classification society Lloyd’s Register (LR) said the week-long meeting of delegations from IMO member states ""demonstrates the work is continuing"".

Noting that the member states and the shipping industry more broadly evidenced ""some uncertainty"" around whether the working group would be convened at all given the delay to the NZF, the classification society said the IMO secretariat confirmed the working group was obliged to complete a set of actions determined and approved at the prior MEPC meeting in April 2025.

The IMO Secretariat also offered the working group a bit of insight into the status of the NZF, according to LR.

However, according to LR, the Intersessional Working Group demonstrates that the work is continuing. The below are the main points from this week:

IMO is continuing to develop guidelines that are envisaged in the IMO Net-Zero Framework;

That MEPC 84 (April/May 2026) will discuss options around resuming MEPC ES.2 which is expected in October 2026;

Confirmation that ISWG-GHG 21 will still meet in April 2026, the week before MEPC 84; and

That the terms of reference for the 5th IMO GHG Study will be concluded at MEPC 84.

Consequential update as a result of the NZF not being adopted

There was some uncertainty if the ISWG-GHG would be convened this week in light of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2. At the outset it was clarified that the ISWG-GHG must fulfil its terms of reference received from MEPC 83 (April 2025).

During the week the Member States sought clarity from the Chair and the Secretariat on what the adjournment meant for issues such as the ability to amend or work on the NZF before the resumption of the MEPC ES.2, as well as if further developing guidelines is relevant at this point in time.

The IMO Secretariat later offered some clarification on the work surrounding the Net-Zero Framework whilst acknowledging that the ISWG-GHG 20 terms of reference was not to consider this matter:

The IMO Secretariat is still analysing the impact of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2;

MEPC 83 (April 2025) agreed the agenda for MEPC 84 (May 2026). There is a provisional agenda and Member States have been invited to attend;

The agenda for MEPC 84 includes item 13 on the work programme, where MEPC 84 will be able to consider the programming of the reconvened MEPC ES.2, including the exact dates it will take place;

ISWG-GHG 21 (takes place the week before MEPC 84) will pre-consider documents submitted to MEPC 84 that are within its terms of reference.

Guidelines supporting the NZF

MEPC ES.2 finalised a work plan to consider the proposed guidelines in support of the NZF. The work plan was subject to adoption of the NZF, which did not take place, so we believe it will be further confirmed at the MEPC ES.2 resumption expected in Autumn 2026. When considering the various guidelines, it was agreed to not conclude any specific requirements at this point and to use this time to share views in the hope of finding a consensus going forward.

Reward for the use of Zero or Near Zero GHG emissions fuels and technologies

When considering the design of a reward for the use of Zero or Near-Zero GHG emissions fuels and technologies, most delegations expressed a desire for the Reward to be fuel/technology and feedstock agnostic, but it was also acknowledged that there is a balance between rewarding fuels and technology available today versus longer term technology readiness. It was also noted that many want the reward to be simple in design and easy to manage. There is still a range of views on the reward with many asking for a flat reward for the first 5 years, but others want to consider auctions and other reward designs.

IMO Net-Zero Fund

It was concluded that further work was needed on a number of elements related to the implementation of the IMO Net-Zero Fund. This included:

Legal status of the governing provisions

Participation on non-Party and observer organisations in the Governing Board

The possibility of holding a GHG Expert Workshop to develop governing provisions of the Fund will be considered at MEPC 84.

GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) and GFI compliance approaches

ISWG-GHG 20 focussed on exchanging views and not on concluding matters, noting the Net-Zero Framework adoption was adjourned, ISWG-GHG 20 invited delegations to work together intersessionally on development of guidelines on GFI compliance approaches and submit these to a future session.

Terms of Reference for 5th GHG study

The IMO’s 5th GHG Study is due to commence in 2026, with approval scheduled for Spring 2028. The IMO GHG Studies are used as a measure of the fleet’s emissions profiles, both as a measure of the success of existing regulations and to inform decisions on future regulations. The terms of reference were discussed and provisionally inter alia include:

Provide an inventory of total annual GHG emission series from 2018 to 2025/6, or as far as that is possible with the statistical data available.

Provide emission estimates for domestic and international voyages according to two methods – the “voyage-based allocation” and the “vessel-based allocation” of emissions.

Develop clear and unambiguous definitions and refine methods for differentiation between domestic and international voyages with the aim to exclude domestic voyages from the inventory for “international shipping” to mitigate the risk of the double counting of emissions from ships.

The emission estimate should include a thorough review of the methodology and assumptions used in the inventory forming part of the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020, taking into account peer-reviewed/high-quality literature work undertaken since publication of the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020.

Estimates of GHG fuel intensity should be included, along with the share of zero- or near zero fuels and energy sources. GHG fuel intensity should be provided in well-to-tank, tank-to-wake and well-to-wake phases.

The world fleet CO2 emissions and energy consumed (MJ) per transport work should be included for 2018-2025/6, based on the statistical data available.

Emission estimates are to ensure that tank-to-wake estimates are comprehensive and include fugitive emissions, operational releases, and both combusted and non-combusted fuel emissions.

Assessment of the embedded carbon of all equipment and infrastructure required for well-to-wake provision of the fuels and energy sources. This should include any depreciation, recyclability and other circular economy considerations for that pathway and vessels.

Further work will continue at MEPC 84 to approve the terms of reference and initiate the tendering process for the commencement of the study.

Fuel Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) Framework

It was noted that MEPC 84 (April/May 2026) is the next time the LCA Guidelines can be amended. The working group on Life Cycle GHG Intensity of Marine Fuels (GESAMP-LCA) may not be able to address all methodological issues whilst it prioritises the assessment of emissions factors which have been submitted to it. It was also acknowledged that there is a need to consider, within the LCA framework, ‘avoided emissions’ and ‘net-negative’ emissions fuels and technologies.

Outstanding unrelated MARPOL Amendments

It’s worth noting that a further consequence of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2 meeting last week was that several amendments to MARPOL Annex VI were not adopted, although they have no impact on the NZF:

Designation of the North-East Atlantic Ocean as an Emission Control Area for SOx & particulate matter and for NOx.

IMO ship fuel oil consumption system (IMO DCS) data accessibility

Review of the short-term GHG reduction measure

Use of multiple engine operational profiles for a marine diesel engine related to NOx requirements

Clarification of entries in data reporting required by regulations 27 and 28

It is yet to be confirmed how or when these will be adopted. It could be that they are separated from amendments which are in adjournment so that they can be adopted before the NZF is further considered, and therefore they could be adopted separately.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54869642365_61e33ee609_6k-scaled-e1761310487382.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:21:33.368062

“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation.
We help develop and drive global environment and climate laws on shipping, principally at the United Nation’s shipping regulator, the International Maritime Organization.","London, 24 October 2025:– As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO Member States for rising above last week’s rancour – when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year – by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear – this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, said Delaine McCullough, Clean Shipping Coalition president. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, said John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO. “By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

“While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

“This week’s meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples Rights and community well being of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “Despite the implementation delay of the IMO’s GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.”

“Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

“The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation. This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”

However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.
“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said.
However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy.
“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other.","The Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez, has acknowledged the disruption caused by the postponement of the vote on the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, describing last Friday’s session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) as “not a normal IMO meeting”.

Despite the setback, Dominguez emphasised that the organisation remains united in its mission and continues to make progress towards decarbonising the global shipping industry.

Speaking at the Women’s International Shipping & Trading Association (WISTA) Annual General Meeting and Conference in Barcelona, Dominguez addressed the fallout from the extraordinary MEPC session, which was expected to advance a landmark proposal for a global levy on greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.

The levy is central to the IMO’s plans to implement its 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy, which commits the sector to reaching net-zero emissions “by or around 2050”.

However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.

“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said. “We shouldn’t be rated as an organisation based on the postponement that took place, but instead on the fact that, like everybody else, we are dealing with different changes, different geopolitical situations, and we need to adapt.”

He added that the IMO had already resumed work on decarbonisation, with technical discussions beginning earlier this week to address key concerns raised during the meeting, including the management of the proposed climate fund, certification processes and the practicalities of implementation.

The proposed greenhouse gas levy is seen as one of the most significant measures in the IMO’s efforts to accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels and technologies.

Supporters argue that it would create a global financial mechanism to incentivise emission reductions while generating funds for developing countries to access low- and zero-carbon technologies.

However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy. Developing nations, led by China, India and several African countries, have expressed concerns that the mechanism could unfairly impact emerging economies and increase trade costs, while others — including many European and Pacific states — are pushing for a globally applied price on carbon emissions from ships.

Dominguez, who took office as IMO Secretary-General in January 2024, urged patience and diplomacy, stressing that consensus-building is at the heart of the organisation’s mandate.

“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other. Those that had different views were in the same room, and we’re not going to find agreements right away, because we need to understand those comments and address them with further discussions and data,” he said.

“That is how multilateralism continues to work, and it is at the centre of everything that we do at IMO. So again, a silver lining — the member states are talking to each other.”

The delay at MEPC has prompted criticism from some climate advocates who argue that the shipping sector — responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions — is moving too slowly to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

Yet Dominguez insisted that the IMO’s record over its 70-year history shows resilience and adaptability.

“It’s easy for critics to judge the IMO’s success based on the events of last week, but we have decades of progress behind us — improving safety, security and shipping’s environmental performance. We are a strong organisation with a large and relevant programme of work,” he stated.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has voted 57-49 to postpone the adoption of the “net-zero framework” until October 2026. As the shipping sector’s first binding deal on global greenhouse gas emissions, the agreement would have established progressively stricter intensity limits starting in 2028. The framework also imposed substantial fees for noncompliance, with high emitters facing up to $1.5 million in additional annual fees by 2035 that could raise fuel costs by roughly 20%. Low-emission vessels would be rewarded with tradable carbon allowances.

The United States dominated discussions and actively worked to prevent the deal’s adoption, joined by other oil-exporting countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Russia. President Donald Trump called the framework a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” and US negotiators characterized it as an illegitimate international tax with dire economic consequences. Proponents of the deal faced threats of tariffs, new port fees, and visa restrictions during the talks, prompting them to decry the tactics as bullying which undermined years of multilateral climate work.

The Impacts of Aid Cuts on Refugees in Malawi (The New Humanitarian)

The UN refugee agency has received only 23% of the $26.3 million needed for 2025 operations at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi, which is home to 56,000 refugees from the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, and Ethiopia. These cuts have triggered a dramatic decline in essential services, as longtime UNHCR staff depart, offices stand empty, and equipment is sold off. Partner organizations like Plan International have withdrawn entirely from the camp, thus shutting down child protection, health services, education programs, and livelihood support.

Critical programs at Dzaleka also have disappeared, including youth-friendly health services providing contraceptives, HIV testing, and counseling. Other cuts include $50 monthly stipends for volunteer workers, as well as access to a youth center, while university scholarships are uncertain. The resulting desperation has driven increased theft and petty crime in the camp, pushing young women into survival sex work. Reduced oversight also has allowed human trafficking networks to flourish, and now leaves refugees without legal protection or advocacy against potential forced repatriation.

As Extreme Weather Spirals, the UN Calls for Worldwide Early Warning Systems (Al-Jazeera)

A new report by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged, as climate-induced catastrophes increase. The agency found that nearly half of all countries lack early-warning systems for extreme weather events as natural hazards are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. In the past 50 years, weather and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people. Ninety percent of those deaths have occurred in developing countries.

The past decade has seen major progress in adoption to meet this challenge. The number of countries using a form of multi-hazard warning system has risen from 52 to 108. Yet half of 62 systems assessed by the organization operate at a basic capacity, while a further 16 percent work at less than basic capacity. The crisis in early warning system adoption is even worse in fragile and conflict-affected states, which further illustrates the inequalities in access to them.",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/plugins/open-graph/open_graph_protocol_logo.png,N,,2025-10-24 11:21:43.805800

Blended finance offers a practical way for private investors to participate in this transformation by balancing commercial returns with manageable risk.","The maritime sector, responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is under growing pressure to decarbonise. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious targets to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 and for the entire sector to achieve net zero emissions by 2050². For India, a nation with one of the world’s largest coastlines and busiest ports, the challenge is also an opportunity: to modernise its maritime infrastructure and transition to greener shipping, boosting competitiveness, creating jobs and supporting the country’s 2070 net zero target.

Modernising ports, shipyards and logistics networks is not just a climate imperative but also a major investment opportunity; one that can deliver long-term returns through trade growth, regional connectivity and sustainable infrastructure development.

The scale of investment required for this transition is immense. The Government projects India will need an estimated $18 billion to become a global player in shipbuilding and repair, $388 billion to expand shipping tonnage and $260 billion to enhance green tonnage. While public funds cannot meet financing needs of this magnitude, the scale and diversity of investment required present a significant opportunity for private investors to participate in one of the world’s most dynamic maritime markets. Yet many remain constrained by mandates that limit exposure to higher-risk emerging market infrastructure.

Mobilising Private Investment

Blended finance combines public and private capital in a single structure, with public capital deployed strategically to remove or reduce a project’s risk. This enables private investors to participate at a risk-return profile in line with their mandates, opening doors to access opportunities and outcomes that were previously out of reach.

For investors, India’s long-term maritime roadmap, AmritKaal Vision 2047, aligned with its national climate commitments – sets a clear pathway for sustainable growth and investment. What’s needed now is catalytic capital to enable early investors to participate.

The government recently announced a ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund (MDF), a blended finance facility with 49 per cent concessional capital from the government, including contributions from state-owned major ports. The facility aims to raise 51 per cent commercial capital to support investments across the Indian maritime industry – from ports and shipping to shipbuilding and inland waterways.

Charting the course ahead

India’s maritime sector is still in the early stages of development. The focus now is on building modern, resilient and sustainable infrastructure to support the nation’s economic ambitions. With hundreds of billions of dollars needed to modernise shipbuilding, expand tonnage, and green its fleet, private capital will be essential to closing the investment gap.

Blended finance offers a practical way for private investors to participate in this transformation by balancing commercial returns with manageable risk. At the same time, it provides developers with access to capital across the project lifecycle – from early-stage development to construction and operation – helping them move projects from concept to commercial reality.

As India scales up its maritime and blue economy, this approach can unlock the long-term investment needed to deliver cleaner shipping, stronger ports, and sustainable growth; generating both financial and impact returns, and positioning the sector as a cornerstone of India’s low-carbon future.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:56:11.717555

An April agreement to cut CO2 emissions from shipping collapsed following pressure from Washington and Riyadh – which pushed through a one-year freeze to eventually axe it.

The US warned it could sanction countries voting in favour, arguing the plan would benefit China at its expense.

All EU countries except Greece and Cyprus opposed the delay, but their defection broke the bloc’s unity. The future of the deal – aimed at removing the dirtiest ships from the seas by mid-2030 – now hangs in the balance.

Asked by Euractiv whether the Commission supports Washington’s call for renegotiation, an EU spokesperson said: “We are ready to work towards building bridges with all other parties.”

Yet, the same official admitted, a new Council mandate “may potentially be needed.”

Because shipping decisions require unanimity, Athens’ resistance threatens to derail future coordination. “There will be time for changes to be made and to find common ground,” a senior EU diplomat said earlier this week.

Tensions first flared on Tuesday, when Greece held the COP30 mandate “hostage” to remove references to the IMO.

“The Commission is looking into the position taken by certain EU Member States during the voting process last week,” the spokesperson added.

According to an EU source, defecting from the bloc’s pre-agreed voting position may not have been illegal, but it was a “political disaster”.

Whether the Commission had issued an explicit instruction on the US proposal remains unclear.

The NZF outlines new requirements for shipping fuel greenhouse gas intensity, along with a pricing and reward mechanism.

Its adoption could help generate demand tailwinds for sustainable fuels such as green ammonia and e-methanol, with a regulatory framework seen as key to de-risking and unlocking investment in sustainable fuels and modern vessels.

Among the nations opposing carbon pricing in shipping are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and the US.

Decision-makers are now scheduled to reconvene in October 2026, with the earliest possible implementation in March 2028.

Chile has a multibillion-dollar pipeline of green hydrogen and derivatives projects, primarily in the Magallanes and Antofagasta regions.

In a social media post, Mario Marchese, project director of the US$11 billion (bn) green ammonia initiative HNH Energy, currently in the permitting phase in Magallanes, said that while approval would have boosted demand, the momentum behind green hydrogen adoption remains solid.

“Enthusiasm remains strong,” he said. “The European market, led by Germany, has adopted hydrogen as a fuel in its energy matrix; Japan and South Korea are leading the adoption of ammonia in the power generation sector; and shipping companies from these same countries are continuing with plans to introduce ammonia-fueled vessels starting in 2028.”

Marchese added that expanding infrastructure in Magallanes was a vital piece of the puzzle, alongside local regulatory efforts.

“We are in a marathon, where endurance and resilience will be key to reaching the finish line. However, the constant imposition of new requirements, regulatory changes, and increased restrictions only serve to further prolong this race, while our competitors are clearing the path and making it easier to face the challenge,” he said.

Global consultancy Rystad Energy said the IMO’s decision, while creating uncertainty, would allow member states time to refine “ambiguous or contentious elements” and build a ""stronger, more implementable framework.""

Before the IMO meeting, Rystad’s maritime decarbonization team identified what it describes as gaps in the NZF that would need to be addressed.

“Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables,” said Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad. “Our findings suggest progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.”

Marcos Kulka, executive director of industry chamber H2 Chile, also posted online, pointing to the uncertainty created by the delay but noting that Chile could turn the extra time to its advantage.

“From Chile, we reaffirm our commitment to a green maritime transition, where the traceability of our export products is key,” he said. “We will continue to promote the technological, regulatory, and infrastructure developments needed to address the climate crisis, strengthening the country’s role as a reliable supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions for the world.

“The delay does not change our course: it gives us time to be better prepared, more coordinated, and more determined. The maritime transition is moving forward, and Chile will be at the forefront of driving it.”

Shipping accounts for around 3% of global CO₂ emissions — a proportion expected to rise without an agreed decarbonization mechanism. Most countries from Europe, Latin America and Oceania supported advancing the NZF at the IMO meeting.

Green hydrogen can be combined with nitrogen to produce green ammonia or with recycled carbon dioxide to produce e-methanol. The versatile derivatives can be used as sustainable fuels or industry feedstocks.

BNamericas’ project database lists 70 active green hydrogen and derivatives sector initiatives in Latin America in the early works or planning phase.

In Chile and elsewhere, projects have started entering the environmental review phase.

… commented Christiaan de Beukelaer, Senior Lecturer in Culture and Climate at the University of Melbourne and an IMO observer.

Meanwhile, Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager, Pacific Environment, said: “Despite last week’s delay tactics and bullying, we’ve moved past obstruction and into real progress with productive discussions now shaping the Net Zero Framework and how it will be implemented. We applaud the member states and industry leaders driving this forward.”

Luckily, this week, more voices joined the conversation, and the discussions took on a constructive and more respectful tone. It was a meaningful step toward rebuilding the confidence, transparency, and integrity we need to deliver the pollution cuts future generations deserve

Biofuels puzzling Member States

Countries disagreed on the role of biofuels in shipping’s clean transition, with Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushing for a “technology neutral” approach that would favour cheap, existing sources of biofuels, including food and feed stock (e.g. soy and palm oil). This is opposed by the EU and Pacific Island states, who are concerned about sustainability and scalability, and favour renewable e-fuels as a long-term solution.

Researchers, civil society groups and international campaigners have repeatedly warned against the use of food and feed-based biofuels on ships on environmental, climate and human rights grounds, and urge the IMO to disincentivise this fuel option. One way to do this is by considering the full lifecycle of emissions of marine fuels, including accounting of indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines.

The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels, like crop-based biofuels, with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions

… Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at T&E, stressed.

This has received the support of Mexico, UK, and several Pacific Islands who also expressed their concerns for addressing food security and environmental sustainability. The LCA guidelines are set to be finalised in April 2026.

Alternative energy sources and their role in reducing emissions

Member States and industry expressed broad support for the inclusion of wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero (ZNZ) energy source alongside solar and shore power, recognizing their contribution to emissions reductions.

Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case. The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion

… explained Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk.

Furthermore, Gavin Allwright, Secretary General at International Windship Association (IWSA), pointed out that he technology is proven, scalable, and available globally today. Companies don’t have to wait for international regulation to catch up – they can make a sure bet on wind now and start reaping the benefits of a future-proof, truly zero-cost and zero-emissions energy source.

IMO Net-Zero Fund

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which according to experts must be equitable in order to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition. The Chair encouraged countries to consolidate their proposals ahead of the next round of negotiations in April.

We were pleased to see constructive discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Fund, ZNZ reward methodology and guidelines related to GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI). However, with the Net-Zero Framework hanging in the balance, and much more still to be discussed, it is as important as ever for States to prioritise justice and equity in their decision-making, and ultimately, to continue to push for the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework

… noted Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green.

The IMO’s latest talks on the Net-Zero Framework showed both progress and persistent divides — from debates over biofuels and e-fuels to renewed optimism around wind propulsion. After another round of negotiations, one big question remains:",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54869582123_2ee16efcbc_k-e1761301682823.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 09:17:16.483081

“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO Member States for rising above last week’s rancour - when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year - by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear - this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, said Delaine McCullough, Clean Shipping Coalition president. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, said John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO. “By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

“While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

“This week's meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples Rights and community wellbeing of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “Despite the implementation delay of the IMO's GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.""

In this context, the postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, which would have introduced the first binding global carbon pricing mechanism under international law, has broader implications.
For many, the cost of compliance could translate into reduced service frequency, higher shipping rates, or slower speeds to conserve fuel.
Despite the postponement, the debate around the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has emphasised how the shipping industry’s decarbonisation will depend not just on fuel technology but also on financial equity, infrastructure readiness and regulatory credibility.
As Jefferies concludes, “the market may see near-term cost relief, but the long-term achievement of Net Zero ambitions remains deeply uncertain.”","The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to postpone the adoption of its proposed Net Zero Framework has sent ripples through the shipping and energy markets, with analysts warning that the delay could reshape the industry’s decarbonisation path and distort investment in next-generation fleets.

According to Jefferies’ analyst Omar Nokta and his team, “a consequence of last week’s indecision will be a shift back to conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders and for many of those currently in the orderbook.”

Their analysis, issued following the IMO’s retreat, cautions that the organisation’s climate ambitions, a 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050 relative to 2008 levels, are now in jeopardy.

For years, uncertainty over viable fuels had already weighed on newbuild demand, as the IMO’s long-term plans for a carbon pricing mechanism remained under negotiation.

Dual-fuel or alternatively fuelled vessels are considerably more expensive than their conventionally fuelled counterparts, with Jefferies estimating that dual-fuel “capable” ships, able to operate on alternative fuels from delivery, cost $10–15 million more than conventional or “ready” ships, which can be converted later.

Citing Clarksons data, Jefferies notes that while 41 per cent of the global orderbook now consists of dual-fuel or alternative propulsion vessels, only 16 per cent are equipped to use alternative fuels immediately upon entering service.

This has led to a growing trend of converting “capable” orders into “ready” configurations to lower capital expenditure, particularly for deliveries from 2027 onwards, when engine changes remain feasible.

“The trend of dual-fuel ship orders had leaned towards LNG,” Jefferies added, “amid concerns about methanol availability and ammonia safety.”

This was most visible during last year’s surge in containership newbuildings, when industry giants who had initially pursued methanol opted instead for LNG dual-fuel systems.

In this context, the postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, which would have introduced the first binding global carbon pricing mechanism under international law, has broader implications.

The framework would have required ships engaged in international trade to meet annual emissions-intensity limits, with non-compliant operators purchasing “remedial units” priced at $100 and $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent.

These fixed-tier penalties were intended to incentivise the transition to low-emission fuels such as green methanol and ammonia, while generating an estimated $11–13 billion annually for a new Net-Zero Fund to support the fuel transition and climate adaptation projects.

However, experts warn that postponing the framework’s adoption risks delaying critical investment decisions and widening disparities between large and small operators.

Analysts at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), led by Evelyne Williams and Trevor Sutton, note that “large shipping firms are considerably more likely to absorb the added cost of remedial units and retrofitting their fleet,” thanks to access to capital, fuel contracts and credit trading mechanisms.

Smaller operators, they caution, will face greater difficulty meeting compliance costs, often resorting to slower operations or passing expenses to customers.

The Columbia team further emphasises that the impacts will vary across trade routes.

“On highly competitive routes, carriers have an incentive to absorb part of the compliance costs to protect market share,” they wrote, “whereas on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers facing little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and exporters.”

The IMO’s framework also envisaged the Net-Zero Fund as a corrective mechanism to offset cost disparities between conventional and low-emission fuels, while supporting vulnerable states and smaller carriers.

Yet implementing such a mechanism within two years poses significant challenges. The IMO, primarily a regulatory body, would need to develop governance systems and disbursement protocols for one of the largest climate funds in the world, on a scale and timeline far exceeding that of the Green Climate Fund, which took five years to operationalise.

Without rapid progress, analysts warn that the compliance burden could hit small island developing states (SIDS), developing economies, and thin-margin carriers hardest, long before financial assistance is available. For many, the cost of compliance could translate into reduced service frequency, higher shipping rates, or slower speeds to conserve fuel.

Moreover, the framework’s fixed carbon prices could distort incentives by anchoring transitional fuels like LNG just below the penalty threshold, discouraging further innovation.

Without regular adjustments and coordinated investment in bunkering infrastructure, ship retrofits and safety standards, the sector risks becoming trapped in a “transitional compliance equilibrium”, meeting regulatory thresholds without achieving true decarbonisation.

Verification also remains a concern. Under the current design, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) would rely heavily on self-reporting and national port authorities, exposing the system to inconsistencies and enforcement gaps across jurisdictions.

While major maritime hubs such as Rotterdam, Singapore and London are expected to anchor compliance globally, the risk of “dirty corridors”, older, higher-emission vessels confined to non-participating ports, remains.

Despite the postponement, the debate around the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has emphasised how the shipping industry’s decarbonisation will depend not just on fuel technology but also on financial equity, infrastructure readiness and regulatory credibility.

At SMM 2026, the global maritime flagship fair taking place next September, companies will showcase technologies driving the energy transformation of the global shipping sector.

It came as a blow: The member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) failed to achieve consensus on a global climate protection policy last week. The decision was postponed to next year. In an extraordinary session, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) discussed effective measures to implement the IMO climate goals, such as a global alternative fuel standard and an emission penalty for ships exceeding set limits.

But those dealing with the practical implications of these plans remain sceptical about the IMO’s climate ambition. This is one of the conclusions drawn by the SMM Maritime Industry Report 2025 (MIR) which summarises the responses of roughly 1,500 industry leaders surveyed by Hamburg Messe und Congress (HMC).

Roughly half of shipowners and suppliers (51 per cent) doubt that the net-zero goal can be achieved by 2050. 46 per cent of shipyards share this assessment. Just barely one third of respondents (29 per cent of shipowners, and 26 per cent of yards) are more optimistic. Market insiders such as yard manager and Chairman of the SMM Advisory Committee Dr. Klaus Borgschulte are not surprised: “After all we are talking about roughly 90,000 ships world-wide – a gigantic undertaking that can hardly be accomplished within the given time frame.”

Investing in the future

Despite these doubts, sustainability continues to range at the top of the industry’s agenda: 78 per cent of responding suppliers expect the issue to become even more prominent in the coming years. Nine out of ten companies are in the process of implementing specific measures, a marked increase from the previous survey (+ 8 per cent).

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is already reshaping investment decisions, operational strategies, and fuel choices across the maritime value chain, confirms Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime. According to the classification society’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, the number of climate-friendly ships is growing steadily. The supply of the required alternative fuels remains limited, however. Over the next ten years, the MIR survey participants expect the demand for LNG, biofuels, methanol and other hydrogen-based fuels to soar. In addition, hybrid propulsion solutions could play a key role, as well.

Efficiency is the new capital

“In the end, cost and availability will be the decisive factors,” points out Richard von Berlepsch, long-standing fleet director at the shipping company Hapag-Lloyd. There can be no doubt that alternative fuels will be more expensive than conventional ones, making efficient ship operations a crucial success factor for both newbuilds and vessels in service.

As a consequence, the industry puts the focus on retrofitting existing ships, implementing measures such as propeller and energy system upgrades, or installing exhaust gas treatment systems: According to the MIR survey, 78 per cent of shipowners are planning to invest in appropriate technologies, especially propulsion systems (66 per cent) and digital solutions (58 per cent). “Shipowners are willing to spend money,” says von Berlepsch.

Success through collaboration

“Generally there is confidence and a strong willingness to invest,” says Hauke Schlegel, CEO at VDMA Marine Equipment and Systems. “Our industry has the right technologies to lead the shipping sector to a climate-friendly future.” Schlegel believes close collaboration between the different stakeholders is key to taking the industry up to the next level.

Claus-Ulrich Selbach, Vice President Exhibitions Maritime & Energy at Hamburg Messe und Congress, emphasises: “Everyone involved understands there won’t be that one single technology solution to achieve the IMO’s zero-emission goal by 2050 – neither in terms of propulsion technology nor when it comes to energy sources. There will be a combination of many technologies enabling the shipping sector to achieve net zero, combined with operational efficiency enhancements including digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence.

The ship speed at this speed also has the greatest impact on the R, and the nonlinear effect of ship speed on the R is particularly significant.
In addition, the relationship between wind speed and Cd undergoes significant changes near the critical wind speed (approximately 8 m/s).
As the wind speed increases, the Cd shows a sharp decrease trend with the increase of wind speed.
In view of this, this article innovatively constructs an effective power rose graph model for rotor sail, which can intuitively display the performance of rotor sail under different parameter combinations.","In 2023, the 80th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 80) adopted the ‘IMO Strategy on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships’, which clearly sets the goal of achieving net-zero emissions for global shipping by 2050, while continuing the phased requirement from the 2018 initial strategy that ‘the carbon intensity should be reduced by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 2008’. Against this backdrop, wind-assisted propulsion technology, as an important path for green shipping, has attracted increasing attention in its innovation and application. The maritime industry is advancing multi-faceted decarbonization to meet IMO’s targets, with key pathways including: alternative fuels (e.g., methanol, ammonia) as core deep decarbonization solutions; energy efficiency technologies (e.g., hull optimization, air lubrication); and operational measures. Within this landscape, wind propulsion technologies like rotor sails play a distinct role. As a renewable, zero-carbon auxiliary power source, they directly reduce main engine fuel consumption, offering advantages such as low operational costs, compatibility with existing vessels, and synergies with other solutions. So, the ancient and timeless concept of wind powered ship has been revived and innovated under the promotion of modern technology. Among them, the rotor sail stands out among various new wind propulsion technologies due to its high propulsion efficiency, and good adaptability to wind direction.

Rotor sails, also known as Flettner rotors, were invented by Anton Flettner in the 1920 s, marking the first practical application of the Magnus effect in ship propulsion. Since then, research and applications have continued throughout the 20th century. The fluid dynamics of flow around a rotating cylinder, the core principle behind rotor sails, is a long-standing topic in fluid mechanics. Early studies laid the foundation for understanding its basic characteristics, while modern research has deepened insights into specific conditions. Stojkovic et al.1, for example, conducted meaningful work under low Reynolds number conditions (Re ≤ 45), clarifying the independence between the drag coefficient Cd and the rotational ratio K in this regime, which enriched the theoretical framework for low-Reynolds-number rotating cylinder flows. Subsequently, Kang et al.2 further investigated the effect of the rotational ratio K on vortex shedding at Re = 60, 100, and 160. The results showed that the rotation of the cylinder could effectively suppress vortex shedding, providing new insights into the dynamic mechanism of the flow around the rotating cylinder. Considering the significant influence of rotational ratio on the flow field around a rotating cylinder, Liu Tianyu et al. and others3,4,5,6 conducted in-depth analysis of the nonlinear characteristics of the flow around a rotating cylinder under different rotational ratios within the range of Re ≤ 400, and established a theoretical framework for the K - Re coupling effect. They jointly promote the accumulation and innovation of knowledge in this field through mutual verification, expansion, and deepening. However, these studies are limited to lower Reynolds number ranges.

In response to the practical needs of engineering, research has shifted its focus to the high Reynolds number field (Re = 104 ~ 106) in recent years. Han et al. and others7,8,9,10 used numerical simulations to reveal the nonlinear characteristics of the flow around a rotating cylinder under high Reynolds number conditions, including the influence of Re on lift to drag ratio and the suppression of vortex shedding by rotational ratio. Additionally, Luo et al. and others11,12,13,14 studied the aerodynamic characteristics of rotating cylinder at different speeds and Reynolds number ranges from the perspective of model experiments, providing more comprehensive experimental data support for the flow field around rotating cylinders under conditions of larger Reynolds number ranges and different rotational ratios.

The lift coefficient, as one of the key parameters characterizing the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder, has always been of great concern in the academic community. Prandtl15 proposed for the first time through groundbreaking experiments that there exists a theoretical limit value of 4π for the lift coefficient of a rotating cylinder. Chew et al.16 conducted numerical analysis on a rotating cylinder with a rotational ratio of 0 ≤ K ≤ 6 under Re = 1000. The results showed that when K = 6, the lift coefficient was 9.1, indicating that the Prandtl limit cannot be exceeded. However, there were disagreements in subsequent studies. Tokumaru et al.17 simulation study came to contradictory conclusions. They observed that under the condition of Re = 3.8 × 103, the lift coefficient exceeded the Prandtl limit when K = 10. The fundamental reason of this contradictory conclusion lies mainly in the differences in the basic condition parameters studied by both parties, namely the Reynolds number Re and the rotational ratio K. For a specific geometric shape of the rotor, the influence of K and Re on its aerodynamic performance is intertwined. The first scholar to jointly consider the influence of these two parameters on the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder was Swanson18, who obtained the influence law of K and Re on the aerodynamic coefficient. Subsequently, the academic community conducted more detailed and in-depth research on these two parameters. Liu et al.19 found using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology that within the range of Re = 0.5 × 105 ~ 1.0 × 105, the lift coefficient reaches its maximum at a rotational ratio of approximately 3.50. The numerical simulation results of Marco et al.20 show that within the range of Re = 1.28 × 106 ~ 5.11 × 106, both the lift coefficient and drag coefficient show an overall upward trend with the increase of the rotational ratio (K < 4). However, Bordogna et al.21 conducted a series of wind tunnel experiments on rotating wind sails and found that the Reynolds number Re had a significant effect on both lift and drag coefficients within the range of speed ratio K < 2.5. However, in the supercritical flow region (Re = 3.6 × 105, Re = 5.5 × 105, and Re = 1.0 × 106), the effect of Re on lift coefficient was not significant. These differential conclusions further demonstrate that the effects of K and Re on the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder are interrelated. It is worth noting that the extended research on three-dimensional effects and multi cylinder interference22,23,24 has further enriched the theoretical system and provided important directions for the engineering optimization of rotor sail.

Expanding the application of rotating cylinders to the field of ships can provide additional thrust for ship navigation, thereby achieving the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. This is the origin of rotor sail. The academic field has actively conducted research on the application of rotor sail in ship, mainly focusing on the key indicator of EEDI to evaluate the energy-saving effect of installing rotor sail on ship. Wang et al.25 systematically studied the energy efficiency characteristics of using sail assisted navigation technology on ocean going cargo ships through model experiments and CFD methods. They confirmed that using sail assisted navigation technology on large ocean going vessels can save fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing strong support for the application of sail technology in the field of ship energy conservation and emission reduction. Ammar et al.26 and Kume et al.27 conducted in-depth aerodynamic performance studies on ship equipped with rotor sail. They not only summarized in detail the thrust generated by the rotor sail, but also objectively evaluated its energy-saving effect, further enriching the understanding of the performance of the rotor sail. Gu et al.28 proposed an EEDI calculation method for sail assisted ships and successfully applied it to the world’s first sail assisted ultra large oil tanker. This practical application not only further verifies the effectiveness of sail technology in improving ship energy efficiency, but also provides valuable practical experience.

It is worth noting that the propulsion efficiency of a rotor sail does not exist in isolation, but is influenced by multiple factors such as its size, structural performance, and the wind conditions encountered by the ship. Gkoufas29 conducted in-depth research on this issue and developed a program for calculating EEDI values based on it, providing important theoretical basis and tools for the application of rotor sail in ship energy conservation and emission reduction. In addition, Zhang et al.30, Yu et al.31, Guzelbulut et al.32 conducted a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental benefits of installing sail on a real ship. Their research not only provides detailed data support for the academic field, but also provides strong practical examples for the application of sail technology in the field of ship energy conservation and emission reduction, further promoting the widespread application and development of this technology.

Through a detailed review and in-depth analysis of existing literature, it can be seen that the basic research methods and achievements of rotating cylinder flow provide direct and valuable references for the study of rotor sail. Specifically, research on rotor sail has covered multiple specific Reynolds numbers such as 103, 105, and 106. It not only delves into the mechanisms by which the rotational ratio K and Reynolds number Re affect aerodynamic coefficients, but also examines the practical application effects of rotor sail on ships, accumulating fruitful research results. However, there are still limitations in the current research scope regarding the application of rotor sail on ship, mainly focusing on the following three aspects:

① Insufficient coverage of Reynolds number. The actual Reynolds number of ships during navigation often exceeds 106, and existing research mostly focuses on a specific Reynolds number condition, which does not fully cover the Reynolds number range under conventional ship navigation environmental conditions.

② Lack of multi factor coupling. There is a lack of research on the synergistic effects of ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed, especially the lack of real-time rotational speed control strategies in dynamic environments.

③ Engineering validation is weak. Research on the impact of rotor sail on EEDI is still insufficient.

In response to the above issues, this study proposes the following innovative solutions:

① High Reynolds number aerodynamic model. Based on the two-dimensional unsteady N-S equation and the k - ω SST turbulence model, a numerical simulation framework covering Re = 1.076 × 106 ~ 4.719 × 106 has been established to cover the high Reynolds number environmental conditions of conventional ship navigation.

② Dynamic rotational speed control strategy. For the first time, a real-time control method based on effective power rose graph is proposed, which matches wind speed, ship speed, and wind direction through double interpolation algorithm to achieve global optimization of rotational speed.

③ EEDI engineering verification. Taking a 15,000 t bulk carrier as a case study, combined with the probability matrix of typical global wind conditions, quantifying the emission reduction benefits of rotor sail per unit height (EEDI reduction of 0.7%), providing data support for the IMO Phase III energy efficiency standards.

This study adopts a three-stage method of “theoretical modeling - numerical simulation - engineering verification”. Under appropriate rotational ratio conditions, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the aerodynamic performance of ship rotor sail under various navigation conditions, taking into account four key factors: ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed. On this basis, draw a rose graph of the effective net power of the rotor sail under different sailing conditions to visually demonstrate its performance characteristics. Furthermore, based on the rose graph, a strategy for controlling the rotational speed of the rotor sail of a ship during actual navigation is proposed. This strategy aims to maximize the navigational benefits of the rotor sail by finely regulating the rotational speed of the rotor. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of unit height rotor sail on the EEDI of ship provides strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the research and application of ship energy-saving and emission reduction technologies.

Determine the environmental conditions for calculation and analysis based on the actual navigation data of the ship, with a sail diameter D of 3 m. Among them, the common speed of ordinary merchant ships is taken as the ship speed, and the range of true wind speed covers winds from level 1 to level 8. As shown in the Table 2.

Based on the above data, the range of Re is calculated to be 1.076 × 106 ~ 4.719 × 106. The range of the rotational ratio K is 0.065 ~ 2.576.

Due to the numerous calculation conditions and the large amount of data results, it is not possible to present all the data results due to space limitations. Therefore, when discussing the influence of ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed on the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail, representative results are selected for discussion.

Combined effect of ship speed and rotational speed

To consider the influence of ship speed, this section presents the analysis results of the lift coefficient Cl, drag coefficient Cd, and lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail when the true wind speed is 8 m/s, the rotation speed is 60 ~ 540 rpm, and the ship speed increases from 10 kn to 22 kn. Among them, the ship speed increases every 2 kn, and the true wind direction angle α is fixed at 90°. The aerodynamic performance analysis results are shown in Fig. 8.

From Fig. 8 (a), it can be seen that the minimum lift coefficient Cl of 1.77 occurs at a ship speed of 22 kn and a rotational speed of 60 rpm, while the maximum lift coefficient Cl of 15.23 occurs at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 300 rpm. There is a strong nonlinearity between Cl and ship speed and rotational speed.

(1) The speed of the ship has a significant impact on the Cl of the rotor sail. Overall, when the speed is maintained at 60 ~ 420 rpm, the Cl decreases with increasing ship speed, and the Cl is negatively correlated with ship speed. Especially when the speed is at 420 rpm, the decrease in Cl is particularly significant, with an amplitude of about 2/3. This phenomenon reveals that the Cl is highly sensitive to changes in ship speed in the low to medium speed range. Under a certain true wind speed, an increase in ship speed will lead to a significant reduction in Cl. However, when the speed increased to 540 rpm, the relationship between Cl and ship speed changed, and a positive correlation began to appear between them. At this point, as the ship speed increases, the Cl also increases, and the fluctuation of the Cl is relatively smooth throughout the entire range of ship speed changes.

(2) The rotational speed also has a significant impact on the lift coefficient Cl. Overall, the Cl reaches its maximum value at a speed of 300 rpm. Specifically, when the speed range is between 60 and 300 rpm, the Cl gradually increases with the increase of speed. This positive correlation reflects an important characteristic of the rotor sail system. When the speed increases, the flow velocity near the suction surface increases and the pressure decreases, while the flow velocity near the pressure surface decreases and the pressure increases. As a result, the pressure difference acting on the surface of the sail increases and the Cl increases. However, when the speed exceeds 300 rpm and continues to rise to 420 rpm, the Cl begins to show a negative correlation with the speed. This phenomenon indicates that when the rotational speed exceeds a certain critical point, the flow field around the rotor sail begins to become more unstable or turbulent. At this point, the phenomenon of airflow separation intensifies, meaning that the airflow no longer smoothly bypasses the surface of the rotor sail, but forms a complex vortex structure, resulting in a significant decrease in lift and an increase in drag. Therefore, although the rotational speed has increased, the effective lift of the rotor sail has decreased. At 300 rpm, the Cl reaches its maximum, and the sail can effectively utilize its own rotation and the flow of surrounding air to generate the maximum lift effect, which is crucial for the navigation efficiency of the ship.

From Fig. 8 (b), it can be seen that:

When ω = 60 rpm, the minimum drag coefficient Cd of 0.11 appears at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 120 rpm, while the maximum Cd of 1.64 appears at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The Cd exhibits weak nonlinearity with respect to ship speed and rotational speed.

(1) When the rotational speed range is 60 ~ 120 rpm, the Cd is positively correlated with the ship speed. As the ship speed increases, the Cd slowly increases. This indicates that within this rotational speed range, the sensitivity of the Cd to changes in ship speed is relatively low. When the rotational speed range is between 180 ~ 540 rpm, the relationship between the Cd and the ship speed changes. Under this rotational speed, the Cd gradually decreases with the increase of ship speed, and there is a negative correlation between the two. It can be observed that when the rotational speed is low, the change trend of the Cd with increasing ship speed is relatively gentle. When the rotational speed reaches 300 rpm, the Cd is greatly affected by changes in ship speed, with the maximum value decreasing from 0.88 to the minimum value of 0.35. After the rotational speed reaches a certain critical point, the control efficiency of the sail is significantly improved and the resistance is reduced.

(2) In addition, the Cd gradually decreases first and then gradually increases with the increase of speed. This is because the aerodynamic force generated by the sail exhibits different characteristics in different rotational speed ranges. Under low-speed conditions, increasing the rotational speed makes the flow field more stable and reduces resistance. Under high-speed conditions, the flow field begins to become unstable, and fluid separation may occur, leading to an increase in Cd instead.

Figure 8 (c) shows the lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different ship speeds, with a higher lift to drag ratio indicating better aerodynamic performance of the sail. Overall, the rotational speed range between 120 ~ 240 rpm exhibits a significant lift to drag ratio, with a maximum value of 77.09 occurring at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 120 rpm. The minimum R of 4.43 occurs under the conditions of a ship speed of 22 kn and a rotational speed of 60 rpm. Similar to the lift coefficient and drag coefficient, there is a strong nonlinearity between the lift to drag ratio and the ship’s speed and rotational speed. Specifically:

(1) The effect of ship speed on lift to drag ratio R varies under different rotational speeds. When the rotational speed is low, the R of the rotor sail gradually decreases with the increase of ship speed, indicating that the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail gradually deteriorates. When the rotational speed is between 180 ~ 540 rpm, the R gradually increases with the increase of ship speed. This indicates that at medium to high speeds, an increase in ship speed helps improve the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail. Especially at rotational speeds of 180 rpm and 240 rpm, the R is at its maximum. The ship speed at this speed also has the greatest impact on the R, and the nonlinear effect of ship speed on the R is particularly significant.

When the ship speed is in the range of 14 ~ 22 kn, the lift to drag ratio R is maximum at a rotational speed of 180 rpm. This indicates that within the speed range of the ship, selecting a speed of 180 rpm can maximize the aerodynamic efficiency of the sail. At other ship speeds, choosing a speed of 120 rpm is a better choice.

(2) At rotational speeds of 180 rpm and 240 rpm, the lift to drag ratio R is at its maximum. When the speed is within the range of 240 ~ 540 rpm, the R decreases with increasing speed. This means that under the same ship speed, the higher the rotational speed, the better the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail may not necessarily be. Therefore, it is necessary to study the speed control strategy of the rotor sail under different conditions.

Combined effect of wind speed and rotational speed

To consider the influence of wind speed, this section presents the aerodynamic performance results of the rotor sail when the ship speed is 10 kn, the rotational speed is 60 ~ 540 rpm, the wind direction angle is 90°, and the true wind speed increases from 1 m/s to 20 m/s, as shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9 (a) shows the lift coefficient of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. From the graph, it can be seen that the minimum lift coefficient of 0.95 occurs at a wind speed of 1 m/s and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The maximum lift coefficient of 15.03 occurs at a wind speed of 8 m/s and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The lift coefficient exhibits strong nonlinearity with respect to wind speed and rotational speed.

(1) The wind speed has a significant impact on the lift coefficient of the rotor sail. Overall, when the rotational speed is 60 ~ 240 rpm, the lift coefficient Cl decreases with increasing wind speed, and the Cl is negatively correlated with wind speed. Especially at a rotational speed of 120 rpm, when the wind speed increases from 1 m/s to 20 m/s, the maximum and minimum Cl differ by nearly 10 times. However, when the rotational speed is increased to the range of 300 ~ 540 rpm, the change in Cl with wind speed exhibits more complex nonlinear characteristics: first gradually increasing, and then gradually decreasing. This phenomenon reveals the existence of a critical rotational speed, and once the rotational speed crosses this critical value, the mechanism by which wind speed affects the Cl undergoes a fundamental change. Specifically, under low rotational speed, the airflow velocity on the windward side of the rotor surface is relatively slow. As the wind speed increases, the boundary layer separates, reducing the generation of effective lift. Therefore, under low rotational speed, an increase in wind speed will significantly reduce the lift coefficient Cl. In contrast, under high rotational speed conditions, the airflow velocity on the windward side of the rotor surface is opposite to the incoming flow velocity, and there is a significant difference between the two velocity values. As the wind speed increases, the rotor sail will experience dynamic stall phenomenon. This complex fluid dynamics process results in a significant nonlinear relationship between lift coefficient and rotational speed under high rotational speeds.

(2) Similarly, considering different wind speeds, the average maximum lift coefficient Cl is obtained at each wind speed at a rotational speed of 240 rpm. Specifically, when the rotational speed is 60 ~ 240 rpm and the wind speed is greater than 8 m/s, the Cl increases with the increase of rotational speed, and the Cl is positively correlated with rotational speed. But when the wind speed is less than 8 m/s, the Cl under a rotational speed of 240 rpm is greater than that under rotational speeds of 300 rpm, 420 rpm, and 540 rpm. Indicating that increasing the rotational speed under higher wind speeds helps enhance the ability of the rotor sail to capture and utilize wind energy. It also indicates that under lower wind speeds, excessively high rotational speeds may cause the airflow on the surface of the rotor to become unstable, generating eddies or turbulence, thereby reducing lift. Therefore, it is not advisable to use excessively high rotational speeds under lower wind speeds.

(3) In the range of 300 ~ 540 rpm, the Cl is negatively correlated with the rotational speed, and a wind speed of 15 m/s is a turning point for the Cl. When the wind speed is less than 15 m/s, the Cl decreases with the increase of rotational speed, and it is not advisable to increase the rotational speed of the rotor to improve the Cl. When the wind speed is greater than 15 m/s, the Cl increases with the increase of rotational speed, that is, increasing the rotational speed can make the rotor better utilize wind energy, thereby improving the lift coefficient Cl.

Figure 9 (b) shows the drag coefficient Cd of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. It can be observed that:

(1) Only at a rotational speed of 60 rpm, the Cd gradually increases with the increase of wind speed. This indicates that under low rotational speeds, the interaction between the rotor sail and the wind is relatively stable, and the flow field remains relatively stable. The flow mainly exhibits laminar characteristics, with less generation of turbulence and eddies, resulting in lower flow resistance. As the wind speed increases, the energy of the flow gradually increases, and the flow field begins to deviate from the original laminar state. The formation of turbulence and eddies becomes more significant. These unstable flow phenomena lead to an increase in resistance coefficient, where the viscous and inertial effects in fluid flow become more pronounced, thereby increasing resistance.

(2) Under other rotational speeds, the Cd gradually decreases as the wind speed increases. This indicates that under higher rotational speeds, an increase in wind speed improves the flow field around the rotor, resulting in a decrease in the pressure difference of the upwind vortex. In addition, the relationship between wind speed and Cd undergoes significant changes near the critical wind speed (approximately 8 m/s). Under low wind speeds (less than 8 m/s), changes in wind speed have a significant impact on flow characteristics. As the wind speed increases, the Cd shows a sharp decrease trend with the increase of wind speed. When the wind speed exceeds 8 m/s, the impact of the increase in wind speed on the flow field gradually weakens, the turbulence characteristics begin to stabilize, and the change in Cd tends to be stable, showing a relatively gentle trend.

Figure 9 (c) shows the lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. From the figure, it can be seen that:

(1) There are significant differences in the effect of wind speed on the lift to drag ratio R under different rotational speeds. Under a rotational speed of 60 rpm, the R of the rotor sail gradually decreases with increasing wind speed. This is because as the wind speed increases, the impact of lower rotational speeds on the surrounding flow field is relatively small, resulting in a gradual deterioration of the aerodynamic performance of low-speed rotor sail. When the rotational speed is higher than 240 rpm, the high-speed rotation of the rotor sail has a significant impact on the wake flow field, effectively suppressing the release of vortices in the wake flow field. As a result, the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail gradually improves with the increase of wind speed. However, when the rotational speed is 120 rpm and 180 rpm, the flow field characteristics of the rotor sail are in a transitional state, and the wind speed has a significant impact on the lift to drag ratio R, showing a nonlinear correlation between the two. Under this condition, the R first increases and then decreases with the increase of wind speed.

(2) When the wind speed is the same, it is not necessarily the higher the rotational speed, the better the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail. Under low wind speeds, low-rotational-speed aerodynamic performance is better. While under high wind speeds, the aerodynamic performance under a rotational speed of 240 rpm is relatively better.

The influence of wind speed and rotational speed on the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail is complex and nonlinear, therefore it is necessary to study the control strategy of rotor sail based on wind speed.

Combined effect of wind direction and rotational speed

To consider the influence of wind direction, this section presents the aerodynamic performance results of the rotor sail when the ship speed is 10 kn, the true wind speed is 8 m/s, and the wind direction angle increases from 0° to 180°. The wind direction angle increases every 15°, as shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10 shows the variation curves of the lift coefficient Cl, drag coefficient Cd, and lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different wind directions. From Fig. 10 (a), it can be seen that:

(1) The effect of wind direction on the Cl of the rotor sail varies under different rotational speeds. Under low rotational speeds (60 ~ 120 rpm), the rotation of the sail has a limited impact on the flow field. At this time, the Cl mainly varies with the change of wind direction, and is less affected by the change of rotational speed. As the wind direction angle increases, the relative angle between the windward side of the rotor sail and the airflow becomes more favorable. The adhesion effect of airflow in the flow field is improved, resulting in a gradual increase in Cl. This indicates that the interaction between the surface of the rotor sail and the airflow is gradually optimized, and the sail exhibits a relatively stable and linear aerodynamic response.

(2) However, when the rotational speed increases to a certain range, the trend of the Cl shows complex nonlinear characteristics. The Cl first decreases when the wind direction angle is small, then rebounds and reaches its maximum value, and decreases again when the wind direction angle continues to increase. At this point, the rotation of the rotor sail has a more significant impact on the surrounding flow field, especially in inducing phenomena such as fluid separation and vortex formation. This leads to the flow field no longer being a simple stable airflow, but becoming more complex. The generation and disappearance of vortex structures, in turn, affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor surface, causing the Cl to exhibit fluctuating changes.

(3) In addition, the maximum Cl is associated with different wind direction angles under different rotational speeds. This indicates that the sensitivity of the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail to wind direction depends on the rotational speed. Under low rotational speeds, the rotor sail may maintain a relatively stable aerodynamic effect, and small changes in wind direction angle may have a significant impact on the Cl. Under high rotational speeds, due to the complexity of the flow field, the optimal wind direction angle changes accordingly. This change reveals the diversity of optimizing the aerodynamic characteristics of rotor sail, as different speeds may require different control strategies to achieve optimal performance.

From Fig. 10 (b), it can be seen that:

(1) When the rotational speed is below 300 rpm and the wind direction angle is small, the drag coefficient Cd of the rotor sail shows less sensitivity to changes in wind direction angle. Under low rotational speeds, the airflow velocity is low, the flow field is relatively stable, and the frictional force and airflow separation phenomenon on the surface of the sail cause less disturbance to the flow structure. Therefore, the change in wind direction angle has no significant impact on the aerodynamic performance around the sail, and the change in Cd is relatively gentle. Within this rotational speed range, as the wind direction angle increases, the sensitivity of the Cd to the wind direction angle increases.

(2) When the rotational speed exceeds 300 rpm, the flow field of the rotor sail becomes sensitive to changes in wind direction angle. At this point, as the wind direction angle increases, the aerodynamic effects on the rotor sail become more complex, and the Cd shows a nonlinear trend of change. The Cd decreases with the increase of wind direction angle, which may be related to changes in airflow separation mode and adjustments in rotor sail surface adhesion. As the wind direction angle further increases, the airflow separation becomes more severe, and the wake structure changes, resulting in a further increase in Cd. This phenomenon reflects the nonlinear response of the flow field around the rotor, and the vortex structure of the flow field has a more significant impact on aerodynamic drag.

From Fig. 10 (c), it can be seen that:

(1) Under different rotational speed conditions, the variation law between lift to drag ratio R and wind direction angle has a similar trend: as the wind direction angle increases, the R gradually increases, and after reaching a peak, it begins to gradually decrease. However, it is worth noting that the wind direction angle at which the maximum R occurs will vary with different rotational speeds. This indicates that there is a significant correlation between the optimal aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail and the wind direction angle, and this optimal performance is adjusted with changes in rotational speed. Therefore, it is necessary to study the control strategy of rotor sail to ensure optimal aerodynamic efficiency under different operating conditions.

(2) Under the same wind direction angle, the R shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase of rotational speed. Specifically, when the rotational speed is low (below 180 rpm), the R gradually increases with the increase of speed. When the speed exceeds 180 rpm, the R begins to show a decreasing trend. It indicates that under low rotational speed, the disturbance of the surrounding flow field by the rotor sail is relatively small, making the flow field more stable and thus beneficial for improving aerodynamic performance. However, as the rotational speed increases, the influence of the rotor sail on the flow field gradually strengthens, and the instability of the flow field increases, leading to a decrease in aerodynamic performance. Therefore, under the same wind direction angle conditions, low rotational speed can usually achieve a higher lift to drag ratio R, thereby improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor sail.

Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that ship speed, rotational speed, true wind speed, and its direction collectively constitute the key factors affecting the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail. The wind speed and direction in the sea area where ships navigate are dynamically changing, and ship speed is not always constant. In order to maximize the efficiency of wind energy utilization, how to accurately match these parameters to achieve the optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail has become an important consideration that cannot be ignored in the operation of the rotor sail in shipping driving. In view of this, this article innovatively constructs an effective power rose graph model for rotor sail, which can intuitively display the performance of rotor sail under different parameter combinations. Furthermore, a control strategy for rotor sail based on rotational speed regulation was proposed, aiming to optimize the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail by flexibly adjusting the rotational speed, thereby ensuring the maximum utilization of wind energy under various sailing conditions.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-21263-4/MediaObjects/41598_2025_21263_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-24 06:17:03.445287

“This year’s Annual Summit has provided a crucial opportunity for leaders from across the globe and maritime value chain to come together address some of the sector’s most pressing issues, including what needs to happen over the next year to set the stage for the adoption of the NZF,” said Global Maritime Forum CEO Johannah Christensen. “One of the overwhelming messages I’ve heard from participants over the last two days is how hopeful and energised they feel after the Summit, particularly coming off the back of such a disappointing outcome last week. The mood has certainly shifted.”

Throughout the Summit, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez also encouraged assembled industry leaders to think of the NZF delay as a pause of the adoption itself, but certainly not a pause on the work underpinning the framework.

“Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such, needs global regulations. Yes, we have paused now on the adoption, but the work on the implementation continues,” he said in a video interview. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” he said at a press event.

One of the themes that emerged from Summit discussions was the important role of the EU and China, as well as developing regions like Africa, as emerging centres of supply and demand for zero-emission fuels and champions that can reaffirm the support for the NZF that existed when it was agreed in April.

Shanghai to host 2026 Summit

China’s significance was underscored with the announcement that next year’s Annual Summit will be held in Shanghai, an important global maritime hub and home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The 2026 Summit will be supported by Shanghai Maritime University and the People’s Government of Hongkou District.

“Shanghai Maritime University is pleased to collaborate with the Global Maritime Forum, Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission, and Shanghai Hongkou District in providing support to the Annual Summit 2026. We look forward to contributing toward an event that will bring the industry together to help drive the energy transition and digitalisation of the shipping industry,” said a representative of Shanghai Maritime University.

“Hongkou District extends its warmest welcome and steadfast support for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2026 to be held next October. As a core functional zone of the Shanghai International Shipping Center, Hongkou boasts a rich history and profound maritime heritage, having previously gathered many of the world’s leading ports, shipping enterprises and institutions,” said a representative of Hongkou District.

Evolution of the All Aboard Alliance

On the second day of the Summit, the All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2030 strategy and industry ambitions for making at-sea careers more safe, attractive, and inclusive.

“With this new strategy underpinning our work, the All Aboard Alliance community can begin addressing the deep-rooted, systemic challenges facing the roughly two million seafarers who are the backbone of global trade,” said Global Maritime Forum Director of Human Sustainability Susanne Justesen. “It will require us to question these entrenched structures, ask hard questions, and confront uncomfortable truths—and it’s something none of us can do alone. We invite companies to join us in working towards a future where seafarers are at the heart of every voyage.”

The Alliance aims to track progress annually and build transparency, showcase what good looks like by defining better standards for living and working at sea, and align financial incentives towards industry adoption of those standards.

New governance taskforce convened

A key theme that has emerged in recent years is the need for strengthened governance to address uncertainty and geopolitical risks.

In Antwerp, assembled industry leaders expressed growing concern about the dark fleet putting the environment and crew safety at risk. Participants pledged to establish a task force, comprised of industry leaders from across the value chain, to explore ways to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance. The task force will convene in the coming weeks and present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

The 2025 Summit was supported by partners CMB.TECH and the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

“CMB.TECH is delighted to have partnered with the Global Maritime Forum for this year’s Annual Summit in Antwerp, the beating heart of maritime Europe,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “Now more than ever, our industry needed to come together to debate about trade, peace, and the future of our planet, all of which are under threat. But this is not our first shipping crisis. For more than 4,000 years, maritime men and women have proven that perseverance, vision, and bravery can make the world a better place. Energised by the positive shipping vibes at the Antwerp Summit, CMB.TECH will continue do its part.”

Rail accounted for 11.5 per cent and inland waterways for 3.4 per cent, both serving as critical modes for high-density and project cargo, from industrial machinery and steel to renewable energy components.

Resilient

Short-sea shipping within the EU remains a cornerstone for breakbulk movements, handling roughly 30 per cent of all freight tonne-kilometres. The segment has proven resilient, connecting Northern European, Baltic, and Mediterranean ports and offering a lower-emission alternative for heavy cargoes that cannot easily shift inland.

On infrastructure, the EU’s transport backbone now comprises 77,000 km of motorways, 201,000 km of active rail lines, and 50,000 km of navigable inland waterways. Over half of the rail network is electrified – a crucial enabler of the bloc’s modal-shift ambitions under the TEN-T policy.

Multipurpose

Meanwhile, Europe’s merchant fleet, representing 39 per cent of world gross tonnage, continues to supply significant multipurpose and Ro-Ro capacity for project cargo flows.

For the logistics sector, the commission’s figures reinforce a familiar message: Europe’s green and digital transition will hinge on efficient, multimodal heavy-freight connectivity. Investment in ports, intermodal terminals, and rail corridors will be essential if the EU is to reduce road dependency and meet its transport decarbonisation targets.",https://www.projectcargojournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Van-der-Vlist-performs-multimodal-transport-from-Spain-to-Poland.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 05:16:29.842050

The goal is to cut emissions of black carbon, a powerful climate pollutant produced by burning fossil fuels. The deadline for submitting formal proposals to the IMO’s pollution prevention committee (PPR13) is December 5, 2025. According to Dr. Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Alliance, a Nordic resolution would signal strong regional support for protecting the Arctic from shipping emissions ahead of the IMO’s critical session in February 2026.

Black carbon, which is over 3,000 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period, contributes around 20% of shipping’s total climate impact. When released near the Arctic, it settles on snow and ice, accelerating melting and reducing the Earth’s albedo effect, its ability to reflect sunlight, thereby intensifying regional and global warming.

Despite its severe impacts on climate and human health, maritime black carbon emissions have more than doubled in the past decade. The Clean Arctic Alliance argues that switching ships operating in or near the Arctic to distillate fuels (such as DMA or DMZ), which produce far less black carbon, offers a simple, immediate solution. While land-based sources have long faced regulations to curb such pollution, similar standards have not yet been implemented at sea.

A recent submission to the IMO (MEPC 82/5/2) by NGOs calls for the inclusion of a polar fuels regulation in MARPOL Annex VI, defining specific low-emission fuels for Arctic operations.

Nations had gathered to adopt the Net-Zero Framework, a package of measures designed to accelerate maritime decarbonisation.

When the Net-Zero Framework was agreed upon at the IMO in April 2025, it was arguably more of a victory for multilateralism than for the environment.

It fell well short of aligning with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, which set the vision for net-zero greenhouse gas emission from the shipping sector “by or around 2050,” plus indicative checkpoints to cut total annual GHGs by at least 20% (striving 30%) by 2030 and at least 70% (striving 80%) by 2040.

The storm

From 14-17 October 2025, when the Net-Zero Framework measures were due to be adopted, a storm blew into the IMO and swept it off course.

Intense lobbying and filibustering from petrostate Saudi Arabia and blatant threats from the United States created chaos and confusion. Ultimately a decision was made to defer the decision by 12 months by adjourning the meeting.

This was a bitter disappointment to the many stakeholders who have worked hard to make shipping one of the only hard-to-abate sectors with a global decarbonisation target, together with realistic measures to practically achieve it.

Overview of the shipping sector

For context, the global shipping sector is the backbone of international commerce, and yet it is largely out of sight and out of mind for most people.

It is a sector which has transformed dramatically in the last century, in terms of the size and number of ships it employs, the volume of goods it transports, the technologies it uses to standardise cargo handling and to facilitate inter-modal transfer of this cargo, the energy it uses for ship propulsion, the technologies it has adopted to increase safety for mariners, and the connection of bodies of water via canals to reduce shipping distances and timeframes.

Ships transport 80-90% of international trade (but only 11% of the economy’s material footprint).

The global merchant fleet surpassed 2.40 billion deadweight tonnes (DWT) in 2023–24, comprising more than 106,000 merchant ships over 100 Gross Tons (GT) and almost 70,000 ships over 300 GT.

Shipping fuels are cheap but are highly polluting. They are essentially the thick sludge at the bottom of the barrel of the oil refining process. The shipping sector consumes around 300 million tonnes of fuel annually, which emits around 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

If the shipping sector was a country, it would emit more than Germany and more than double that of Australia. And on a business-as-usual trajectory, shipping emissions are projected by the IMO to rise by as much as 40% by 2050.

Notably, almost 40% of all shipping (by volume) is involved with transporting energy commodities in the form of crude oil, refined petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and coal.

This makes energy the largest single category in global seaborne trade, ahead of bulk agricultural goods or containerised cargo.

The dominance of fossil-energy transport means that shipping is deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel economy, both as an enabler and as a consumer.

Decarbonising shipping thus means tackling both the fuel used by ships, and fuels transported by ships. Even if ships become carbon-free, the sector’s role as the carrier of fossil energy will continue to link it to global emissions until energy trade patterns shift.

No wonder the petrostates unleashed a storm upon the IMO.

Decarbonisation pathways

How to decarbonise such a sector? Much of the effort has focussed on alternative fuels like methanol, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG and biofuels.

None of these is the silver bullet: hydrogen and ammonia will be very expensive initially, particularly if produced using renewables rather than steam methane reforming, which is highly emitting.

Combustion of LNG emits less than shipping fuels, but methane leaks in the production, transport and storage of LNG limit its decarbonisation outcomes. And methanol and biofuels are hard to scale due to feedstock limitations.

Other initiatives use operational measures such as slower steaming, improved ship routing and port scheduling, and better use of shore power to switch off onboard generators whilst in port. All of these help, but pale in comparison to the emissions from burning dirty fuels.

Are there other things which can have quick impact at scale? Well yes, actually there are. They’re blowing in the wind.

Wind assisted ship propulsion

I have just returned from a Churchill Fellowship to investigate the potential for wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP) for commercial shipping. I visited leading innovators in Singapore, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and the Marshall Islands.

I was pleasantly surprised by what I learned:

Currently, 77 large merchant ships have been installed with wind propulsion systems and a further seven are “wind-ready”: awaiting or undergoing WASP installation. (WASP vessel tracker).

This corresponds to over 4.3 million deadweight tonnes (DWT) of shipping. More than 130 ship installations of WASP systems are on order, most for delivery in 2025/26. By the end of 2025, there should be 100 ships installed. The number of ships installed with WASP roughly doubles each year.

It feels like the early days of solar PV, 20 years ago, before installed capacity skyrocketed.

Innovators have been quietly bubbling away for the last 10-15 years developing new WASP technologies or refining old ones with modern materials and computerised controls.

British company BAR Techologies has used experience from Formula 1 car racing and America’s Cup yacht racing to develop WindWings, a 37.5m tall, solid wing sail which looks like a vertical aircraft wing with its flaps extended for landing.

Two to four powerful WindWings can be fitted to tankers and bulk carriers, either as retrofits or on newbuilds. On average, each wing sail saves one and a half tonnes tonnes of fuel / four and a half tonnes of carbon dioxide per day.

Image: Andrew Dickson

Union Maritime’s newbuild tanker fitted with WindWings, Brands Hatch, had a stunning maiden voyage in which her three WindWings sails avoided 12.8 tonnes of fuel use / 38t of CO₂ in just 24 hours. Sustained peak performance of over 18 tonnes per day was seen for a full six hours.

This was achieved whilst fully laden and whilst maintaining strong sailing speeds in challenging weather. In favourable conditions, the vessel achieved more than a third of its propulsion from wind power alone, proving the ability of the WindWings to deliver not only impressive peak results but also reliable efficiency over extended periods.

Image: Andrew Dickson

Tens of thousands of vessels could be fitted with solid wing sails, or with Flettner rotors like those supplied by Anemoi Marine Technologies (UK), Norsepower (Finland), Eco Flettner (Germany), Dealfeng (China) and others.

French company Neoline just commenced commercial operations with a newbuild, 136m, roll-on roll-off ship with a cargo capacity of 6,300 tons, capable of carrying up to 321 cars, 265 x 20-foot containers, or 125 x 40-foot containers.

Image: Andrew Dickson

It will be powered by two huge SolidSails from another impressive French company, shipbuilder Chantiers de l’Atlantique (https://chantiers-atlantique.com/en/). Three of these SolidSails have also been been fitted to the new luxury cruise liner Orient Express Corinthian, which, when commissioned, will be the largest sailing yacht in the world.

At a smaller scale, French company TOWT operates two 81m wind powered vessels which transport products all over the Atlantic with carbon emissions that are less than 1/10th those of regular ships. TOWT is expanding rapidly, with six more wind-powered ships currently under construction in Vietnam.

And in our backyard in the Pacific, the wind-powered cargo ship the SV Juren Ae was commissioned by the Republic of the Marshall Islands in July 2024 after several years of contribution and funding from Germany through a project called Expanding Low-Carbon Sea Transport in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (LCST).

Juren Ae uses wind power to resupply the communities living on atolls spread across its two million square kilometers of territorial waters, and reduces the need for expensive imported shipping fuels, improving RMI finances.

Low-lying islands in the Pacific are existentially threatened by rising sea levels, and wind-powered cargo ships are a tangible and practical way that Pacific nations can “walk the talk” of maritime decarbonisation.

These are just some of the many WASP innovations I learned about during my Churchill Fellowship.

So, what can Australia do?

Australia privatised its national shipping line, Australian National Line, in the late 1990s, and is now serviced largely by overseas shipping companies which operate on global routes. Not much we can influence there. But there is plenty we can do in our own region and at the IMO:

– If Australia is selected to host COP31, it will be the “Pacific COP” with a focus on Pacific priorities, especially on climate vulnerability, adaptation, finance, ocean/climate justice, loss-and-damage, and resilience. Wind-powered Pacific ships can help make COP31 into an “action COP”, not just an “agreement COP:”

We could help raise multilateral funding for new Pacific wind-powered cargo ships, ideally alongside France and Germany, who have WASP technologies ready to deploy and existing Pacific interests and decarbonisation programs.

We could help bring the Juren Ae to Adelaide for COP31, and potentially also one of the new TOWT vessels currently under construction in Vietnam, to show delegates first hand how their funding could deliver quick and meaningful results in the Pacific.

We can deliver training. Pacific nations could benefit greatly from more maritime and vocational training from Australian providers including the Australian Maritime College and TAFE Queensland. The latter already delivers training for crews of the patrol boats donated by Australia through the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which is a great foundation to expand from.

– We could nurture the local innovators who are developing WASP technologies including GoSailCargo and Advanced Wing Systems and companies developing other maritime decarbonisation technologies including E Class Outboards.

– We should remain resolute supporters of the Net-Zero Framework at the IMO, to hold firm against the petrostates and to complement the national decarbonisation policies which will help Australia achieve its 2035 NDC target of 62-70%.

Wind-assisted shipping is one of the few mature, immediately deployable tools to meet the IMO’s new Net-Zero Framework. In contrast to alternative fuels, wind energy is available everywhere, is available today, is available at the point of use (so no costly and complex e-fuel supply chains are needed) and with zero fuel cost.

And best of all: the cost and energy savings from deploying WASP system on large ships will help us to afford the more expensive solutions that we’ll inevitably need to decarbonise deeper.

“Sometimes the best discoveries are rediscoveries. We have a green, efficient, cost-effective solution ready to help the industry meet its goals now. We have to realise that there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. We can look back to go forwards, rediscovering the huge potential of wind. Let’s keep it simple. It’s time to set sail.” Bertrand Charrier (Source)",https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/andrew-dickson-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 05:16:41.810935

WinGD, a global leader in marine propulsion, is advancing the decarbonisation of shipping through innovative energy systems, cutting-edge emissions reduction technologies, and digital optimisation. The company is redefining the way the marine industry approaches sustainability, combining advanced two-stroke low-speed engines with comprehensive lifecycle support through Global Service by WinGD. ChemAnalyst spoke with Sebastian Hensel, Vice President of Research & Development at WinGD, about his professional journey, the technical and commercial case for ethanol-fuelled engines, and WinGD’s broader commitment to enabling a sustainable future for global shipping.

Complete Interview with Sebastian Hensel

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and R&D leadership experience in marine propulsion and alternative fuels, and how these experiences have shaped your vision and approach at WinGD in pioneering ethanol-fuelled two-stroke engines.

Sebastian Hensel: As Vice President of Research & Development at WinGD, I lead our global innovation strategy, which today is deeply focused on enabling the clean-energy transition in shipping. My journey with WinGD began over 16 years ago as a combustion and computational fluid dynamics expert. Over the years, I’ve held various roles—leading Collaborative Research and Engine Performance and eventually Global Testing — before stepping into my current position.

Taking a moment to reflect on our decarbonisation journey, I’m truly proud of how far we’ve come. The urgency of the energy transition has placed engine technology front and centre, driving us to work at an extraordinary pace, one that’s both exhilarating and deeply motivating. But when we look at the innovation we’ve brought to market in these past years; it is truly remarkable. I am inspired by what we have been able to overcome through commitment, drive and collaborations with our customers and partners. And I am proud of the legacy this will leave for the future generations who are depending on us.

Q: The new ethanol engine is adapted from the X-DF-M methanol engine. Could you explain the key technical modifications made to accommodate ethanol’s higher energy density and different combustion characteristics?

Sebastian Hensel : Adapting the X-DF-M engine for ethanol is related to the different lower heating value, or energy density. This means that we need around 25% less fuel volume to generate the same power when using ethanol. To accommodate that, we need different fuel injection and engine control parameters and a fuel optimized nozzle design.

Because ethanol combustion involves different fuel-air mixtures and flame temperatures, there is also a slight impact on NOx formation. These emissions are tightly regulated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and we manage those with the new injection atomizer design and changes to the control system.

Beyond managing the injected fuel amount and optimizing some combustion relevant parameters, there will be few, if any, changes to the wider storage and fuel supply system. Material compatibilities are similar, for example, and under the IMO’s IGF and IGC Codes (for gas-fuelled and gas carrying ships respectively), the same vessel and machinery safety rules apply for both alcohol fuels.

Q: How has WinGD’s 10 years of research on ethanol and methanol helped shape the design, performance, and reliability of this new ethanol-fuelled engine?

Sebastian Hensel: Our early exploration into ethanol 10 years ago proved that it was a viable fuel for large two-stroke marine engines. Our deep understanding of its combustion characteristics, thermal efficiency and emissions profile, allowed us to design the injection and ignition concepts to optimize performance. Strong early market interest in methanol led us to bring that concept to market first, which has proven to be very favourable with our customers. Given the close similarity between methanol and ethanol, only minimal adaptation of the engine technology is required.

Q: Beyond ship owners, which stakeholders—such as fuel suppliers, classification societies, or regulators—have been critical in the development and commercialization of ethanol-fuelled engines, and how is WinGD engaging with them?

Sebastian Hensel: Collaboration is the key to accelerating the energy transition in shipping, so joining the Global Ethanol Association (GEA) as a founding member was a clear decision. We expect that it will become an important forum for sharing best practices as well as identifying opportunities to develop commercial and regulatory acceptance of ethanol as a marine fuel. By working with GEA, we are helping the shipping industry meet its decarbonization targets with solutions that combine flexibility, reliability, and sustainability.

Engagement with classification societies and regulators on ethanol is progressing. To meet our customers’ needs for flexibility, we are advancing both a pure ethanol engine concept and a dual-fuel solution. Based on current discussions, we anticipate smooth classification approval and see no regulatory barriers to ethanol adoption as a viable marine fuel.

In terms of safety, the viability of ethanol is already accounted for in IMO regulations. IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee Circular MSC.1/Circ.1621 contains Interim Guidelines for the Safety of Ships Using Methyl/Ethyl Alcohol as Fuel, which is valid for both methanol and ethanol as fuel. That means the same safety regulations govern the use of both fuels.

Further engagement with regulators will be essential, as lifecycle analysis guidelines are finalised, ensuring that ethanol’s emissions-saving advantages of ethanol are correctly accounted for.

Q: Can you outline the main technical and operational challenges your team faced in scaling ethanol engine technology, and how WinGD’s R&D approach overcame these hurdles?

Sebastian Hensel : Having first tested ethanol and later developed methanol technology, we’ve been able to adapt for ethanol use with straightforward, manageable technical adjustments.

We are now driving operational execution to meet market demand and deliver parallel technology rollouts. Backed by advanced resource planning and WinGD’s industry-leading testing infrastructure, we are fully equipped to deliver results with speed and precision.

Q: From a market perspective, how do you see global adoption of ethanol-fuelled marine engines evolving, and which regions or types of shipping are likely to lead in uptake?

Sebastian Hensel: There are specific countries where ethanol’s price and availability will make it an attractive option, for example in Brazil, US, Canada and India. Ethanol is already widely available and produced at significant scale in these markets. It is also competitively priced. That is in part due to lower-than-expected demand from road transport due to the emergence of electric vehicles. In some cases, ethanol is cheaper even than diesel, which makes it unique amongst biofuels.

As with other alternative fuels, it is difficult to predict how global availability will evolve, as this will be driven by future demand from sectors including shipping. So, it will likely be operators serving those markets where ethanol is widely available that will adopt it as fuel. In Brazil for example, where there are significant oil, iron ore and soybean exports as well as ready availability of ethanol, it is foreseeable that bulk carriers and tankers serving that market will consider using the fuel.

Our ethanol concept can in principle use methanol as well, with optimisation for either fuel. We therefore expect that ship owners already using methanol—for example container lines—will be exploring the opportunity to use ethanol if it is available and competitive on the routes they trade. And as is often the case with new fuels, vessels already carrying ethanol will have an added incentive to use their cargo as fuel and are likely to be among early adopters.

Q: With sustainability regulations tightening worldwide, how is WinGD leveraging R&D to ensure ethanol engines not only meet current emission standards but also anticipate future regulatory requirements?

Sebastian Hensel: In terms of lifecycle analysis, which will be crucial for determining penalties and rewards under various regulatory regimes, the full well-to-wake emissions for ethanol depend on the feedstock, production process and supply chain (well-to-tank) as well as emissions arising directly from use (tank-to-wake). There are a wide range of ethanol feedstocks and production processes, and an increasing focus by producers on delivering low-emissions ethanol.

According to the Climate Ethanol Association: “Sugarcane ethanol produced at an average facility in Brazil might show GHG savings of approximately 60% compared to fossil fuels under conservative assumptions, while more optimized facilities can achieve reductions approaching 90%. When the same lifecycle analysis methodologies and models are used, US corn ethanol offers similar GHG savings in the 50-70% range. These figures are consistent with existing data across methodologies in Europe, North America, and other regions.

“Further reductions are anticipated through the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. As these advancements are adopted more broadly, it is plausible that average GHG savings could approach—or even exceed—100% relative to baseline fossil fuel emissions under commonly accepted calculation methodologies.”

Those figures suggest that ethanol could play a role in enabling ship operators to meet IMO’s target of net-zero emissions from global shipping by or around 2050. Our role is to design engines that use as little fuel as they can to fulfil the power demand, minimise combustion-related emissions, and work safely and reliably.

Q: Looking ahead, what do you see as the most transformative opportunities for ethanol and other alcohol fuels in the marine sector, and where is WinGD focusing its R&D efforts over the next 5–10 years?

Sebastian Hensel: WinGD envisions a multi-fuel landscape for maritime for several decades at least, with ship operators making fuel decisions based on availability and pricing for their specific areas of operation. Methanol and ethanol will have a role to play, and the scaling of lower emission variants will drive their use further.

Our mission is to ensure that ship operators can choose which fuel works for them, and the new ethanol engine is an example of how we aim to respond to emerging market demand. We offer safe, reliable, and efficient engine concepts for diesel, LNG, methanol, ammonia, LPG, and ethanol.

ChemAnalyst Insights on Ethanol

In Europe, ethanol market activity in Germany during the second quarter of 2025 reflected a balance between soft demand and supply-side constraints. Prices eased slightly as weak consumption and logistical challenges, particularly rail and port disruptions around Hamburg and Bremerhaven, weighed on trade flows. Early in the quarter, subdued blending demand linked to cooler weather and lower gasoline use kept the market under pressure, though stability returned in May as port congestion limited availability. By late June, regulatory compliance needs supported a mild recovery in blending activity. Production costs remained elevated throughout the period due to high agricultural input expenses and energy-related inflation, though some relief was seen toward the end of the quarter. Imports from the Americas and intra-EU shipments helped offset domestic bottlenecks, yet market sentiment stayed cautious amid concerns over trade route irregularities. Looking ahead, stricter greenhouse gas reduction mandates and reduced certificate allowances are expected to strengthen ethanol blending demand in the coming months, adding upward pressure on prices as logistical constraints persist.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-24 05:16:57.716535

The main points from Sinolink Securities are as follows:

Frequent shipping decarbonization policies from the IMO and the EU are being implemented, marking the beginning of the practical phase for shipping decarbonization.

Global marine fuel consumption is approximately 300 million tons, corresponding to over 1 billion tons of carbon emissions (with the EU accounting for about 18%), representing 3% of global emissions. Decarbonization policies for shipping continue to emerge from the EU and IMO. 1) EU: The shipping industry will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System starting in 2024, with non-compliance gaps subject to fines of €100 per ton of CO2e. FuelEU mandates a 2% reduction in carbon emissions starting in 2025, reaching an 80% reduction by 2050, with violators fined €642 per ton of CO2e. 2) IMO: In 2023, a net-zero strategy for 2050 was proposed, and in April 2025, a draft framework for net-zero emissions was approved, establishing a unified carbon price ($380 or $100 per ton of CO2e) to significantly advance shipping decarbonization. 3) China: Green fuel pilot programs are underway, and it has been clarified that the consumption of green hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol can be counted towards green power consumption targets.

The target usage rate for ZNZ by 2030 is 5-10%. Rising compliance costs are contributing to increased demand for ZNZ, leading to a situation of undersupply in the industry.

From the supply and demand perspective, DNV statistics as of August 2025 indicate that the demands for biodiesel, LNG, and green methanol are approximately 200 million/40 million/6 million tons respectively, whereas marine fuel supplies are only at 700,000/100,000/100,000 tons, highlighting a severe shortage of low-carbon fuels.

It should be noted that carbon pricing locks in the upper limit for ZNZ, with current green methanol prices at $6,200 per ton dependent on a carbon price of $380 per ton. Future efforts must focus on cost reduction. By comparison, biodiesel is more economical than green methanol (at 0.21/0.31 yuan per MJ respectively).

Biodiesel: A core decarbonization measure for existing vessels, with high growth in port bunkering volumes.

Demand: Existing vessels primarily rely on single traditional fuels, with extremely high retrofitting costs, making future decarbonization heavily reliant on biodiesel. There has been significant growth in biodiesel bunkering volumes at Singapore ports. Since 2022, biodiesel bunkering volumes at Singapore ports have continued to rise sharply, reflecting that demand is gradually materializing. On the supply side, global biodiesel production is approximately 52 million tons, mainly used for reducing carbon emissions from diesel vehicles. With the rapid development of electric vehicles, biodiesel is expected to shift more towards sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as shipping. Investors are advised to monitor companies like Excellence New Energy (688196.SH) and Shandong Hi-Speed Environmental Energy (000803.SZ).

Biogas: Broad demand for LNG carriers, green premium to drive explosive growth

Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) can significantly reduce carbon emissions, improve the environment, and enhance energy security. China and the EU aim to achieve production targets exceeding 20 billion/35 billion cubic meters by 2030. Historically, RNG development has been slow mainly due to high costs. However, with the implementation of the IMO's net-zero framework and the mass balance model, there is potential for the realization of RNG's green premium (with a green premium as high as 725% for US-based Archaea RNG). The industry is poised for rapid growth. Recommended companies to watch include Viridi Clean Energy (300190.SZ) and China Tianying (000035.SZ).

Green Methanol: Rapid growth in methanol ships expected to result in robust supply and demand in the medium term

The current fleet of 406 methanol vessels (including orders) is projected to generate demand for methanol exceeding 8 million tons. However, global green methanol capacity expected to be operational by the end of 2025 totals only 1.24 million tons, with 730,000 tons in China, indicating a short-term supply shortage. Although global mid-term plans exceed 40 million tons, considering the various challenges in actual implementation (certification, resources, technology, costs, etc.), companies that can quickly implement projects and possess cost and scale advantages are likely to benefit first. Recommended companies to watch include: FJ Eco-Environmental Protection (688335.SH), China Tianying (000035.SZ), Goldwind Technologies (002202.SZ), Jilin Electric Power Co., Ltd.

The International Maritime Organization’s recent failure to adopt a global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping is more than another bureaucratic delay. It is a demonstration of Garrett Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” in real time, replayed on the high seas. The ocean is the world’s pasture and the atmosphere is the waste pit for its exhaust. Each nation benefits from cheap trade and fossil fuels, while the long-term costs are spread thin across the entire planet. What should have been a landmark step toward collective stewardship turned into another lesson in how ideology shapes, and often defeats, cooperation.

Last week’s meeting of the International Maritime Organization ended without agreement on a proposed global carbon-pricing mechanism for the shipping industry. The plan, part of the organization’s Net-Zero Framework, aimed to put a price on emissions and use the revenue to support cleaner fuels and infrastructure. The proposal collapsed after heavy lobbying by the United States, which reportedly warned smaller member states of trade and diplomatic consequences if they supported the measure. Saudi Arabia and a handful of allies backed the U.S. position, framing the levy as a threat to competitiveness. The outcome was a one-year postponement and another missed opportunity to align the maritime sector with global climate goals.

Hardin’s 1968 parable was simple. A group of herders share a pasture. Each gains individually by adding more animals, even though overgrazing will destroy the grass. Since the cost of overuse is shared, the incentive to restrain is weak. The result is collapse of the common resource. The essay was a warning about incentives, not morality, yet over time it has become a mirror. Every ideology that reads it sees a different villain and a different cure.

Classical economists treat the tragedy as a pricing failure. If the pasture is free, it will be overused. Their solution is to internalize the externality through taxes, permits, or private ownership. In their view, the IMO’s proposed carbon levy was a clean correction: make each ton of carbon emitted by a ship carry a cost, and the industry will innovate toward efficiency. The European Union and Japan largely followed this logic, supporting a price on emissions as the most rational way to align markets with climate stability.

Neoliberal thinkers take a similar but narrower view. They agree that markets should solve the problem, but distrust regulation to do it. Their instinct is to commodify the commons rather than govern it. At the IMO, this view was embodied by the United States, which opposed the carbon-pricing framework on the grounds that it was a “global tax on trade.” American negotiators and allied industry groups insisted that innovation would clean up shipping without what they called coercive rules. In practice, that argument protects incumbents. When the world’s largest economy rejects a collective price on emissions, the invisible hand becomes a barrier to cooperation.

Liberals and social democrats interpret the commons as a shared trust that must be managed through transparent rules and mutual obligation. For them, the proposed levy was not an economic scheme but an act of stewardship. The idea was to recycle the revenue into clean fuel infrastructure in developing nations and into adaptation funding for small island states that are already facing the physical consequences of climate change. To these delegations, mainly from Europe and the Pacific, the United States’ behavior was not a philosophical disagreement but a direct betrayal of multilateralism. Reports surfaced that senior American politicians lobbied IMO member states to block the measure even while Congress was shut down. The pattern was unmistakable.

Libertarians saw something different in the same pasture. To them, the tragedy of the commons is not a call for cooperation but proof that ownership is the only safeguard. Each actor should be free to decide how to manage its own resources. The IMO proposal, from this perspective, was an assault on sovereignty. The American fossil fuel lobby and many right-wing commentators framed it as a form of global governance, a loss of freedom disguised as environmental policy. The rhetoric of individual liberty served as cover for collective neglect.

Socialists reversed the libertarian logic. They saw the IMO stalemate as another example of capitalist capture of a shared resource. The atmosphere and oceans are global goods, but the profits from their exploitation flow to a small number of corporations and petro-states. For many in the Global South, the carbon levy was less about pricing efficiency than fairness. Those who had benefited most from burning fossil fuels should shoulder more of the cost of cleaning up. From this view, the United States and Saudi Arabia were defending entrenched interests while vulnerable nations were left to absorb the damage.

Environmentalists read Hardin as a moral text. They see the pasture as the planet itself, not a metaphor. To them, every year of delay at the IMO is measurable harm: more CO2, more ocean acidification, more rising water. Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse emissions, a share comparable to major industrial nations. The science is not in dispute. The failure to act is a political choice that sacrifices the long term for the short term. Environmental advocates saw the U.S. position as deliberate obstruction, not strategic caution.

Technocrats focus on systems management rather than ideology. They believe better monitoring, reporting, and optimization can prevent collapse. Inside the IMO, this tendency shows up in endless debates about metrics, efficiency standards, and pilot programs. Japan and South Korea lean heavily on this approach, preferring incremental improvements over broad policy commitments. The U.S. government often supports this middle ground because it sounds reasonable and buys time. The result is motion without direction.

Nationalists draw the boundaries of the commons around their own borders. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia both invoked national interest to justify resistance. Saudi officials feared that a carbon price would undercut oil revenues, while American leaders claimed it would raise shipping costs for U.S. exports. In both cases, sovereignty was the language of self-interest. Protecting the homeland became synonymous with preserving fossil competitiveness.

Corporate strategists, meanwhile, read Hardin as a business opportunity. For some firms, regulation is an advantage. Maersk and a few other global carriers had already invested in green methanol ships and supported the carbon levy because it would level the field. For others, especially fuel suppliers and smaller operators, delay was profitable. Every year without a carbon price keeps older fleets viable and fossil fuels cheap. The commons becomes a market to game rather than a system to preserve.

Communitarian and Indigenous perspectives reject the framing of the commons as property at all. For small island nations such as Tuvalu and Vanuatu, the ocean is home, not a pasture. Their push for a carbon levy was grounded in reciprocity: those who profit from maritime trade should help protect the seas that make it possible. Watching the most powerful country on earth block even modest reform was a reminder of how fragile moral appeals become in the face of power.

Sociopath’s are not ignorant herders in the commons, but understand the consequences and choose to graze two sheep anyway. They know the pasture will fail but calculate that they will profit before it does. This mindset is difficult to distinguish from the libertarian argument for absolute freedom, which elevates individual choice above collective restraint. Both claim that responsibility is personal and that limits are a kind of tyranny. The difference is intent: the sociopath acts with awareness and indifference, while at least some libertarians rationalize that the damage will somehow be self-correcting. In the current U.S. position at the IMO, the two have merged. The refusal to price carbon is presented as defense of liberty and competitiveness, but it functions as deliberate overgrazing of the planet’s shared field, a knowing decision to take short-term advantage while others bear the cost of decline.

The American position at the IMO cannot be separated from the Trump-era narrative that climate change is a “green scam.” That phrase, repeated by senior figures and amplified through media networks, has moved from the fringes into policy. It casts every environmental measure as a conspiracy to tax the public and weaken the nation. The claim is politically effective because it transforms collective restraint into betrayal. In that framework, science becomes suspect, and cooperation becomes surrender. The same framing shaped the lobbying campaign that derailed the IMO’s carbon-pricing plan.

This episode reveals more than policy disagreement. It shows how ideology determines action when a commons is under strain. The EU approached the problem as a market correction. The Pacific nations treated it as survival. Saudi Arabia saw a threat to its oil rents. The U.S. viewed it through a lens of nationalism and fossil patronage. Every actor was rational within its own worldview, and that is the heart of Hardin’s insight. The tragedy of the commons is not only that people pursue self-interest, but that they define self-interest differently and cannot agree on the rules.

The cost of delay is concrete. Ships have lifespans of 20 to 30 years. Every new vessel built without zero-carbon capability will still be burning fossil fuels in the 2050s. Carbon pricing would have accelerated investment in cleaner fuels and propulsion. Its absence locks in emissions and puts greater pressure on land-based sectors to make up the gap. The longer the IMO remains divided, the more likely regional systems such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will dominate. Fragmented regulation raises costs and weakens global coordination.

The lesson is not that global governance is impossible, but that it cannot succeed without shared definition of fairness. The tragedy of the maritime commons is preventable, but only if the largest players treat stewardship as a duty rather than a concession. Markets can manage scarcity, but they cannot manage morality. The United States once led the creation of institutions designed to prevent exactly this kind of collective failure. Its choice to obstruct rather than lead shows how far it has drifted from that role.

The oceans remain open, the ships continue to sail, and the carbon continues to rise. Hardin’s pasture is the planet. Whether it endures will depend not on our technology, but on our willingness to see the commons not as a burden to avoid, but as the foundation of shared prosperity.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-23-2025-07_10_52-PM-800x445.png,N,,2025-10-24 05:17:08.684784

Industry Warns Delay Could Slow Maritime Low-Carbon Transition.

LNG Gains Competitiveness as Green Fuel Investment Faces Uncertainty.

Fossil fuels might still be the go-to energy source for shipping, especially since the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is facing delays with its new decarbonization rules, as noted by industry insiders. Advocates of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) were counting on these regulations to speed up the transition from oil-based fuels to greener options like methanol and ammonia, reports S&P Global.

Framework Adoption Postponed

Just earlier this month, member states of the IMO decided to push back the adoption of the NZF by a year, which means we might not see it implemented until the end of this decade—or even longer. Thomas Blomgren-Hansen, Chief Advisor at the Danish Maritime Authority, said: “The delay will in reality lead to a reopening of text because a revision of dates is required.” “That could lead a complete renegotiation, putting the whole deal at risk [and] delaying the transition for an even longer period.”

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, oil-based fuels made up a whopping 97% of the global bunker mix in 2024, with LNG trailing at just 2%. The new IMO regulation aims to impose a cost on the greenhouse gas emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2028, which should help close the price gap between traditional and sustainable fuels.

Industry Reaction and Concerns

This delay has thrown a wrench into the plans of shipping and bunker companies that are trying to make a low-carbon shift, although some are optimistic that it gives them more time to refine the framework’s design. Jan Dieleman, Cargill’s shipping head, said: “After what happened… I can understand why people don’t want to double down on net-zero fuels.”

There’s been pushback against the framework from the US, Russia, Venezuela, and several Middle Eastern oil producers, who argue that it imposes hefty carbon costs and strict decarbonization rules. Saudi Arabia has suggested a postponement, with backing from China, India, and key flag states like Panama and Liberia. Even with an EU mandate to adopt the regulation, Greece and Cyprus abstained from the postponement vote. Greece’s Minister of Shipping, Vassilis Kikilias, said the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.

Regulatory and Implementation Outlook

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez emphasised: “The framework is in place, what we need to do is to develop the guideline. What we paused is the adoption itself, not further work.” DNV estimates LNG could become a non-compliant fuel by the end of this decade, though member states could extend its use with a low default emissions factor.

Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, noted: “LNG just got another improvement in its relative competitiveness versus the fully green fuels,” citing increased uncertainty over the investment case for green fuel production due to the framework’s delay.

LNG as a Transitional Fuel

LNG can reduce emissions by 20%-30% compared with oil-based fuels. Supporters argue LNG-capable ships can later switch to bio-LNG or e-LNG for deep decarbonization.

SEA-LNG, an industry association promoting marine LNG, stated: “The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonization of the global maritime industry.”

The association plans to continue scientific studies to support the IMO’s work. Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker fell from 18.8 g CO2e/MJ in 2019 to 13.9 g CO2e/MJ in 2024.

Geopolitics Overshadowing Regulation

Some industry participants warn that the adoption of the IMO regulation may depend more on geopolitical factors than content.

Maria Skipper Schwenn, Director of Public Affairs at Bunker Holding, said: “The world we’re living in today is very different from the one just a few years ago. I think it would be fair to say that the opponents’ reasoning had very little to do with shipping.” The combination of regulatory delays, political opposition, and high fossil fuel reliance continues to cloud the outlook for a low-carbon maritime transition.

“Using the average recycling pattern during 2000-2019, we estimate that the current minimum recycling overhang is 500 ships and 1.8 million TEU,” says Niels Rasmussen, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO.
Rasmussen highlights that this results in a maximum overhang estimate of 850 ships and 3.1 million TEU.
The data highlights that the share of older ships has not been higher since the early 1970s.
“However, our estimates indicate an overhang of 6-10 percent of currently trading ships, equal to 33-55 percent of ships older than 20 years.","The shipping industry has speculated for years that a potential recycling wave might be coming, but it was delayed by low capacity, high demand, and issues ranging from the pandemic-related shipping surge to the diversions away from the Red Sea. Industry trade group BIMCO highlights that many older ships have been hanging on longer than anticipated, creating a large market overhang ripe for recycling.

“Using the average recycling pattern during 2000-2019, we estimate that the current minimum recycling overhang is 500 ships and 1.8 million TEU,” says Niels Rasmussen, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO.

The numbers could be even more dramatic, BIMCO says, if you use the data from the earlier recycling of ships during the weaker market conditions of the 2010s to estimate the current maximum recycling overhang. Rasmussen highlights that this results in a maximum overhang estimate of 850 ships and 3.1 million TEU.

The share of ships 20 years old or older has increased from 16 percent at the beginning of 2020 to 24 percent currently, BIMCO reports. These ships were used to fill gaps in capacity over the past few years, and they are likely to make up the bulk of future recycling. The data highlights that the share of older ships has not been higher since the early 1970s.

“So far this year, only 10 container ships have been recycled,” says Rasmussen. “This extends a pattern of low recycling activity seen since 2021, as many ships have continued trading beyond their usual recycling age. Applying historical recycling patterns, we have calculated an average lifecycle for each size segment of the fleet and compared it to the current fleet. For instance, during the period from 2000 to 2019, 20 percent of ships were recycled before the age of 20, and 53 percent of ships were recycled before turning 25 years old.

There are a few other factors that could influence the speed at which ships are sent for recycling. BIMCO highlights the currently very large orderbook, the threat of ship demand erosion if ships return to normal Suez Canal routings, and regulatory requirements to improve ship efficiency. All of this could contribute to the higher end of its estimate.

“Future recycling is very difficult to estimate accurately,” says Rasmussen. “However, our estimates indicate an overhang of 6-10 percent of currently trading ships, equal to 33-55 percent of ships older than 20 years.

He notes that the estimated overhang is larger than the orderbook for all ship segments, but that is especially so for the small, under 8,000 TEU, vessels. He says this points to a trend where fleet growth in the coming years will be driven exclusively by the larger ships, which in turn could drive further cascading of larger ships into routes where smaller ships are currently deployed.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Wreckage_Salvage/ship-recycler-s-association-of-turkey.1bb908.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:16:28.252509

In April, the United Nations member states approved the initial draft of the IMO's policy Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which would mean imposing a global shipping emissions tax from 2028 in order to fund cleaner maritime technologies and help developing nations transition to low-carbon shipping.
The NZF also set goals to cut annual carbon emissions from international shipping by at least 20% by 2030, and 70% by 2040, and then finally reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Although pressure from the U.S. is significant, the controversy surrounding the Net-Zero Framework extends well beyond Trump's objections, delegates at the conference said.
On the other hand, the NZF will still have the same emissions benchmarks to hit, regardless of the delay.","A delay in charging a global shipping emissions tax could stall critical investments in green fuels, and cause decarbonization efforts across the industry to slow, warned industry stakeholders at a ocean conservation and sustainable shipping conference.

""We were disappointed that this did not go through,"" said Marco Romero, a decarbonization specialist with risk management firm DNV, speaking at 2025's One Ocean Week conference in Seattle, Washington, on October 21. ""We were looking for something that would harmonize the global approach.""

In April, the United Nations member states approved the initial draft of the IMO's policy Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which would mean imposing a global shipping emissions tax from 2028 in order to fund cleaner maritime technologies and help developing nations transition to low-carbon shipping. The NZF also set goals to cut annual carbon emissions from international shipping by at least 20% by 2030, and 70% by 2040, and then finally reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

But, on October 17, all members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted to postpone a vote on passing the NZF until late 2026. The pullback came a day after President Donald Trump criticized the plan as a ""global green scam tax on shipping,"" and threatened to impose port levies and sanctions against any nations that supported it.

Although pressure from the U.S. is significant, the controversy surrounding the Net-Zero Framework extends well beyond Trump's objections, delegates at the conference said.

""There is a coalition of groups that had concerns — some of them very valid, and some of them very rooted in practicality,"" said Romero.

Some groups were critical of the framework for its inclusion of biofuels as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, pointing to how the production of biofuels still releases carbon through deforestation and intensive farming practices. Others claimed that the NZF wasn't ambitious enough to meet any of the emissions benchmarks it had set along the path to net-zero.

In any case, delaying the NZF could end up being a double-edged sword, Romero said. On one hand, it provides an opportunity for the industry to reconvene and address any outstanding concerns. On the other hand, the NZF will still have the same emissions benchmarks to hit, regardless of the delay. ""What we lost is the mechanism to get there,"" Romero explained.

As deliberations over the framework continue in 2026, Romero stressed the need for individual stakeholders, countries and regions to continue taking steps to develop cleaner fuels and reduce emissions themselves. Ultimately, that collective effort will be critical in bridging the gap created by the IMO's delay.

""We can be disappointed by the outcome, but we can be energized by the outcome as well, and we can figure out a way forward together,"" he said.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2025/10/23/IMO-Net-Zero-Framework-SCB-File-Photo.jpeg?height=635&t=1761242381&width=1200,N,,2025-10-23 19:17:04.779418

Under the NZF, vessels that meet emissions targets generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels generate Rectification Units (RUs), classified into: Tier I (RU1s): for vessels meeting minimum targets.

According to the company’s analysis, surplus unit prices will be driven more by market dynamics than by biofuel price differentials.

Ahead of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting, a comprehensive study by Rystad Energy’s maritime decarbonization experts revealed major gaps in the current framework that must be addressed to ensure a fair and sustainable energy transition for the global shipping sector.

The postponement gives member states additional time to refine ambiguous or contentious elements of the framework and produce a more robust and actionable plan.

The study highlighted a substantial gap between projected clean fuel supply and targeted demand, worsened by infrastructure limitations, raising doubts about the feasibility of the proposed transition timeline.

It also identified ongoing imbalances in the carbon trading mechanism, forecasting that demand for Tier II offset units will exceed available surplus units until 2035 — a structural deficit likely to push trading prices toward the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The report stressed the need for careful design of the reward mechanism to avoid turning it into a mere fine collection system. While cost gaps are expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale improve, an effective incentive structure remains essential to encourage sustainable practices. By addressing these key issues, the IMO can develop a more efficient and equitable framework to support a low-carbon future for the maritime sector.

Rystad Energy noted that decarbonizing shipping is a complex challenge that extends beyond the industry itself, being closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The findings suggest that progress will likely be slower than IMO’s current projections due to infrastructure constraints, technological readiness, and the interconnected nature of energy systems.

While the industry has shown strong commitment, practical limitations call for a pragmatic approach. The IMO is expected to use the extra year to develop a more realistic and balanced framework.

Junlin Yu, Vice President of Supply Chain Research at Rystad Energy, said, “The IMO should use this additional year to craft a framework that is both practical and fair.”

The company recently published a detailed report on the financial structure of maritime decarbonization under the Net Zero Framework, available on its official website.

The analysis was based on an extensive database covering conventional fuels, hydrogen derivatives, and biofuels, alongside a global review of alternative-fuel fleets, port infrastructure, and shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet emissions targets generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels generate Rectification Units (RUs), classified into:

Tier I (RU1s): for vessels meeting minimum targets.

Tier II (RU2s): for vessels failing to meet required targets.

Non-compliant vessels can offset Tier II rectification units by purchasing surplus units from compliant ones.

Rystad’s projections show a complex interaction between surplus and rectification units. Surplus units are expected to start at 40 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2028, rising to 53 million by 2035, while RU2s could soar from 47 million to 234 million tonnes annually by 2035.

This imbalance will dictate market pricing, with Rystad forecasting that RU2 demand will remain above available surplus supply until 2035 — likely pushing trading prices toward the Tier II penalty cap.

According to the company’s analysis, surplus unit prices will be driven more by market dynamics than by biofuel price differentials.

Given the limited supply of advanced biofuels for shipping, surplus unit prices are projected to approach the penalty ceiling of $380 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent after transaction costs.

Yu added, “While surplus units will offset much of the Tier II penalties until 2030, this may also limit financial incentives for early adopters of zero-emission technologies.”

A structural shift is expected in 2031, as surplus units decline and compliance requirements tighten, increasing emission deficits among shipping companies. This will result in higher penalty revenues, strengthening the NZF Fund’s ability to finance industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

The study also highlighted design challenges in the framework — notably the two-year holding limit on surplus units, intended to prevent dilution of future emission-reduction efforts. However, this restriction could discourage early adoption of clean technologies, unlike the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation, which allows permanent storage of units.

Financial forecasts show that the IMO’s Net Zero Fund could grow significantly, with Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate around $13 billion in 2028 and nearly $79 billion by 2035.

Still, the analysis questions whether the framework will effectively support the shift to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its initial stages.

Rystad estimates that the required reward levels to achieve cost parity between e-fuels and conventional fuels will initially be prohibitively high, leading to a financial shortfall until 2030 — even if the fund’s full resources are allocated to incentives.

Over time, however, technological advances and production scaling are expected to narrow this gap, ultimately producing a substantial fund surplus after 2030.

Bitcoin rose more than 2% over the past 24 hours, climbing back above $109,500 as traders positioned themselves ahead of Friday’s release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) — the week’s most closely watched economic event.

With most official economic data on hold due to the ongoing US government shutdown, investors expect the upcoming inflation report to be the only major indicator guiding markets this week.

Analysts at QCP Capital wrote in a Thursday report: “The only data point that really matters this week is Friday’s CPI, as it will be the sole reading the Federal Reserve sees before resuming its policy communications.”

The firm added that a softer-than-expected inflation reading could reinforce the “soft landing” narrative for the US economy and provide fresh momentum for Bitcoin prices.

“A 0.2% reading would support that narrative and keep Bitcoin’s upward trend intact,” the report said, noting that gold (GC=F) posted its biggest one-day drop since 2020 as the US dollar strengthened, while Bitcoin briefly spiked to $114,000 before pulling back.

Geopolitical Tensions Dominate, but Trade Talks Offer Hope

Despite persistent geopolitical tensions weighing on global risk appetite, reports of potential trade talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump brought some relief to markets.

The two leaders are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea later this month, in a meeting investors hope could ease trade and security frictions in the region.

Diverging Views on Bitcoin’s Path

Bitcoin has declined since reaching a record high above $126,270 on October 6, 2025.

John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, believes the rally is over.

“The Bitcoin bull run is done!” he told Yahoo Finance UK. “I think we’ve completed the five-wave advance and are now entering a bear market that could last through the end of 2026.”

Glover added that while a retest of $124,000 is possible, he expects prices to trade lower overall in the coming months.

“I’m looking for a major correction into the $70,000–$80,000 range — perhaps even lower — and the final target will become clearer as prices evolve over the next few months.”

Institutional Demand Could Fuel Renewed Optimism

On the other hand, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, said Bitcoin could see another leg higher if short-term selling pressure eases.

“If current sellers step back, allowing institutional demand to play a larger role, Bitcoin could mirror gold’s 2025 rally,” Hougan wrote in a research note this week.

He pointed out that gold has gained roughly 57% in 2025, driven by surging central bank purchases that have more than doubled since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war — from around 467 tons annually to 1,080 tons, according to Metals Focus.

Hougan said this level of buying nearly matches demand from gold exchange-traded products (ETPs), which helps explain why gold has outperformed Bitcoin this year.

“If central banks are the main engine behind gold’s rally, it’s only natural that Bitcoin hasn’t risen at the same pace,” he added.

Despite strong demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investors, Hougan believes cautious sentiment continues to limit gains: “Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached $200,000 despite robust inflows, because price-sensitive investors keep selling into every 10%–15% rally.”

Oil prices surged by 5% on Thursday after the United States imposed new sanctions on Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil over the war in Ukraine, extending the gains recorded in the previous session.

Brent crude futures rose by $3.39, or 5.4%, to $65.98 a barrel at 10:18 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained $3.31, or 5.7%, to $61.81 a barrel.

Ole Hansen, an analyst at Saxo Bank, said the US sanctions mean that refineries in China and India — the largest buyers of Russian oil — will now have to seek alternative suppliers to avoid being cut off from the Western banking system.

Washington reaffirmed its readiness to take further action, urging Moscow to agree immediately to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The UK had already imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil last week, while the European Union approved its nineteenth sanctions package against Russia, which included a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Market Structure Shift and US Inventory Drop

The Brent crude forward curve shifted into backwardation, with the front-month contract trading $1.98 above the six-month delivery contract, reflecting tightening short-term supplies.

Following the announcement of US sanctions, Brent and WTI futures both jumped more than $2 a barrel, also supported by an unexpected drawdown in US crude inventories.

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS, said the impact of the sanctions on oil markets depends largely on India’s response and whether Russia can find new buyers for its crude.

India has become the largest importer of discounted Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but private refiners are expected to sharply reduce purchases under the new sanctions, according to industry sources.

Sources added that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest buyer of Russian crude, plans to significantly scale back — or even halt — its Russian oil imports in the coming period.

Lingering Doubts Despite the Rally

Some analysts remain skeptical that the new sanctions will bring about a lasting shift in the oil market. Claudio Galimberti, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said: “So far, most of the sanctions imposed on Russia for more than three and a half years have failed to meaningfully curb its oil production or revenues.”

He added that concerns over potential oversupply — due to increased output from the OPEC+ alliance — continue to cap price gains, while UBS expects Brent to remain within a $60–70 per barrel trading range.

On the demand side, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed that US crude, gasoline, and distillate inventories declined last week amid improved refinery activity and stronger domestic consumption.",https://dixdeynibyck7.cloudfront.net/images/content/General/BUSINESSJOURNAL_01_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 17:17:00.576667

As the old English saying goes, “Every dark hour brings forth its champion.” In this case, nuclear power could be that champion.
Nuclear Power Generation represents a clean and virtually inexhaustible source of energy and much higher power generation capacities on board ships.
The use of nuclear technology will also herald the rise of a new category of service suppliers (e.g.
The first floating nuclear power plants—potential forerunners of nuclear-powered merchant ships—are expected to enter service within the next decade.","The shipping industry has resolved to reduce its GHG emissions. Ambitious targets have been set for GHG emission reduction with a view to achieving a net-zero carbon future by 2050. This transition represents nothing short of a maritime renaissance, driving a paradigm shift in how ships operate. A wide range of low- or zero-carbon fuels and technologies—biofuels, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, onboard carbon capture, battery assistance, and wind-assisted propulsion—are being explored, with sustainability as the central theme.

However, concerns have been raised on the production, supply, availability, and costs of new fuels and technologies (not to forget safety!). For example, today’s renewable power generation capacity is far from sufficient to meet the needs of large-scale green fuel production. Scaling up production is also not a trivial task, as it will need sustained efforts by all nations in an era of fragile geopolitical alliances and growing trade protectionism. Replacing or retrofitting existing ships with ships using cleaner fuels will also need enormous efforts in shipbuilding as well as recycling the existing fleet. This raises the question: is the industry being too hard on itself—and what will it truly take?

As the old English saying goes, “Every dark hour brings forth its champion.” In this case, nuclear power could be that champion. The Secretary General of the International Atomic Energy Agency noted a few years ago that without nuclear energy, achieving global climate goals will be impossible. And why not? Nuclear propulsion is not new - naval ships and submarines have relied on it for decades, while Russian icebreakers in the Arctic continue to use nuclear reactors for onboard power. Nuclear Power Generation represents a clean and virtually inexhaustible source of energy and much higher power generation capacities on board ships. Alternatively, a nuclear reactor may be installed on a barge moored offshore, and this can supply power to remote communities, or for desalination to produce potable water, or even to supply clean electricity to produce green fuels. The possibilities are multiple.

However, public opinion towards nuclear remains cautious—unsurprisingly, given the legacy of Chernobyl and Fukushima. Nuclear Technology works, there is no doubt about that. It is the potential consequences that are overwhelming should this technology face setbacks. The World Nuclear Association reports that more than 14000 reactor years of accident-free service have been recorded in a marine environment. The safety record of nuclear technology provides optimism, but this underscores efforts by designers, manufacturers, and regulators to ensure that this technology is safely harnessed. Nuclear Technology also offers a unique proposition to the maritime industry in the sense that at the end of life, not just the ship but also reactor components, auxiliaries, and spent fuel will have to be safely recycled.

There has been a spurt in the growth of Generation IV nuclear technology, which is deemed to improve safety using passive measures. The inherently safe design is expected to reduce to a major extent the possibility of another Chernobyl and Fukushima.

The arrival of General IV nuclear technology is undoubtedly cannot be ignored and shipping will explore what it can derive from the use of such technology. From a classification society’s perspective, the approval of nuclear technology for civilian ships will present significant challenges. The marine environment is considerably more dynamic and hostile compared to the terrestrial application. Classification societies will also need to engage with multiple regulators—from the International Atomic Energy Agency to national nuclear bodies, as well as port and coastal state authorities. It is anticipated that Class will serve as a bridge between the maritime and nuclear disciplines to ensure the safety of the ship, persons, and environment.

The role of a systematic and holistic risk assessment is paramount, as well as a robust procedure to qualify the use of such “FOAK” (first of a kind) technology for onboard use, which is necessary (while ensuring that it is technology-agnostic). The importance of Material Technology needs no emphasis to ensure safe containment of radioactive fuel, as well as ensuring that appropriate materials are used to shield against the effects of harmful radiation in the event of loss of containment. The use of nuclear technology will also herald the rise of a new category of service suppliers (e.g. fuel removal, replenishment, nuclear equipment inspection, maintenance, etc.) for which Class will have to prepare (though it is anticipated that most (if not all) of these will be guided by regulations for terrestrial nuclear plants). Licensing of shipyards and recycling yards to handle nuclear-powered ships is also foreseen.

ISM and Cybersecurity audits are additional aspects which Class (acting as recognized organizations for flag administration) will be called upon to address, as also the decommissioning stage, keeping into account both safety and security (i.e. to ensure non-proliferation).

Time is short. The first floating nuclear power plants—potential forerunners of nuclear-powered merchant ships—are expected to enter service within the next decade.

Class Rules and Guidelines have to be ready for these. Personnel with knowledge of nuclear technology will also be essential in a Classification Society, for this, we have resolved to undertake an ambitious program to ensure our staff is ready for the future with nuclear.

These are uncharted waters, but the shipping industry has always proven capable of navigating safely. IRCLASS is gearing up to rise to this occasion. As Gene Kranz, lead flight director of Apollo 13, famously said, “Failure is not an option.”

The idea behind these policies is to ease pressure on natural ecosystems and agricultural land, and to create a more circular economy where products are reused rather than discarded.
Yet this is the first and most important thing to understand about biofuels: When combusted, they still emit carbon dioxide.
This means that consumers cannot be confident that their biofuels are not directly fueling the destruction of natural ecosystems, the release of huge carbon bombs, and the dispossession of local communities.
That’s why members of my organization gathered outside the IMO headquarters in London during the negotiations, seeking to persuade delegates that biofuels cannot be part of shipping’s green transition.","On October 17, the member states of the International Maritime Organization decided to postpone the decision on adopting a new framework to cut international shipping emissions until 2026. But one year of delay does not erase shipping's ultimate goal — decarbonization by 2050, as stipulated under the pre-existing 2023 IMO Revised Strategy. To reach this, many potential pathways are under consideration, including harmful biofuels.

Recent concerns about sustainability and land use have encouraged governments and businesses to promote policies incentivizing so-called “waste” or “residue” feedstocks for biofuels, such as used cooking oil. The idea behind these policies is to ease pressure on natural ecosystems and agricultural land, and to create a more circular economy where products are reused rather than discarded. However, like the biofuels boom more broadly, there have been unintended consequences.

Biofuels are often praised for their supposed carbon savings. Since many are derived from plants, the logic goes that the carbon they sequester while growing offsets the carbon released when they burn. Yet this is the first and most important thing to understand about biofuels: When combusted, they still emit carbon dioxide.

That might be acceptable if their cultivation really did pull an equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil. But this process is not permanent — crops are harvested and burned — and often the cultivation of biofuels actually reduces the amount of carbon a given landscape can store.

The establishment of biofuel plantations often takes place on formerly biodiverse, intact rainforest or peat wetland in South America or Southeast Asia. The destruction of these healthy ecosystems releases huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, as well as displacing wildlife. These lands are also home to Indigenous or traditional farming communities, who often face violent eviction or persecution at the hands of the state or big business, exposure to toxic agrichemicals, loss of food security, and the erosion of culturally important practices tied to these ecosystems.

Even when new soy or palm plantations are established on land that is already used for agriculture, this often displaces food crops and cattle ranching onto more marginal or uncultivated land, a process known as indirect land use change (ILUC). The result is shrinking wild habitats, accelerating deforestation, and rising food insecurity as prime farmland is diverted from dietary staples.

Industrial biofuel farms are also monocultures, covered in soil-depleting fertilizers and carcinogenic pesticides, and so provide little to no habitat while reducing the land’s natural ability to hold in CO2. They are also more vulnerable to severe forest fires.

These damaging impacts are what have led to the surge in demand for waste- and residue-based fuels. These are also often cheaper than pure vegetable oils. Common feedstocks such as used cooking oil or palm oil mill effluent can be made chemically identical to virgin vegetable oil, and several whistleblowers have revealed how sloppy auditing and overt fraud are widespread in sustainability certification processes that are entirely captured by industry-led bodies. This means that consumers cannot be confident that their biofuels are not directly fueling the destruction of natural ecosystems, the release of huge carbon bombs, and the dispossession of local communities. This is all without even touching on the occupational hazards and poor conditions suffered by workers in biorefineries.

Many campaigners tout electrofuels or ""e-fuels"" as potential alternatives, but they are very early in development, with no guarantee of ever becoming commercially (or environmentally) viable.

Yet, shipping presents an ongoing challenge. As biofuels are cheap and largely available, they will be the go-to solution of the industry, with the threat of unleashing an environmental disaster. That’s why members of my organization gathered outside the IMO headquarters in London during the negotiations, seeking to persuade delegates that biofuels cannot be part of shipping’s green transition.

Wind-assisted propulsion is doubtless a crucial tool in cutting both emissions and general energy usage over long distances at sea. But to fully address the problem of shipping’s enormous carbon footprint, policy must go beyond techno-fixes to encompass the unspoken truth at the heart of this debate — that demand reduction is required to bring shipping in line with necessary decarbonization targets. There simply have to be fewer container ships, making fewer, shorter journeys, and carrying less freight.

We may have to wait a year to find out. But whether shipping charts a bold course to shores unknown, or relies on tired industry-led false solutions designed to maintain the status quo, is yet to be decided. Governments now have an historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean solutions that protect people and the planet.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2022/12/15/EMISSIONS-CONTAINER-SHIP-POLLUTION-CLIMATE-CHANGE-iStock-Arkadij-Schell-1326664988.jpg?height=635&t=1671166945&width=1200,N,,2025-10-23 16:21:37.575171

Money, you say?

Bingo. But the projected annual US$15 billion bill facing container shipping lines and other carriers under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only one line item in the decarbonization cost projections for maritime freight movement.

And money is only one shipping industry red flag.

As noted previously in the Substack Shipping News, the estimated annual cost to decarbonize maritime shipping ranges between US$8 billion and US$28 billion.

Make that US$90 billion if you factor in the investment in bunkering and the other energy transition infrastructure needed.

Overall, the bill for reaching the IMO's 2050 zero-emission shipping destination is estimated at US$1.6 trillion.

But that is just a ballpark, big-picture number.

A small example of the impact on everyday operating costs was provided during an October 8 review of the main findings in DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025.

Eirik Ovrum, the report’s lead author and the principal maritime environmental technology consultant for the maritime industry risk-management company, noted that the IMO’s NZF “will effectively double fuel costs by around 2036.”

That raises another NZF red flag issue: what lower-carbon fuel and what technology required to turn that fuel into efficient and financially viable propulsion power will be commercially available to shipping fleets embarked on ambitious decarbonization initiatives?

The answer today is not enough of either. That explains in part why the adoption of heavy marine oil (HMO) alternatives remains minimal.

According to DNV data, 2,851 ships out of a global fleet of 120,936 have dual-fuel technology. That is just over 2%. And only 8.9% of total gross tonnage today is powered by alternative fuels. (See attached DNV chart.)

The HMO alternative for most of those dual-fuel ships (1,539) is liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The good news for NZF fans and decarbonization advocates is that 51% of new ship orders include dual-fuel technology.

Most of those are containerships.

But the IMO is not big on LNG.

DNV’s Maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen has taken the organization to task for erecting roadblocks that “make the pathway less attractive” for shipping to incorporate LNG in its decarbonization toolbox, even though approximately 600 ships sailing today have dual-fuel LNG engines, and another 700 on order will have that technology.

Lower carbon propulsion fuel availability is a major concern for ocean carriers.

Ørbeck-Nilssen has estimated that to hit its 2030 20% emissions reduction target, the maritime shipping sector will need between one-quarter and one-third of the projected global supply of low-GHG fuels.

During DNV’s October 8 session, Ovrum speculated that ocean carriers could only source enough biodiesel to hit that 2030 goal if “road transportation stopped using biodiesel and gave it all to shipping.”

And that is just the fuel-use and availability side of the energy transition equation. Other challenges include the complexities and costs of refitting ships with dual-fuel technologies, allocating space aboard vessels for less energy-dense fuels, and incorporating costly and complex onboard carbon capture systems.

But another red flag raised following the U.S.A.’s NZF rejection in August is this: should a UN agency be entrusted with instituting and policing the initiative and collecting and disbursing the levies raised?

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez thinks so.

At DNV’s September 16 launch of its Energy Transition Outlook 2025 report, Dominguez was confident that member states at the Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London would approve the initiative.

During his discussion with Ørbeck-Nilssen, he downplayed doubts about the approval.

Dominguez told the audience that “there is a consensus to move forward” with the framework.

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided. So, I’m still confident that we will continue to move forward [in] October.”

Dominguez got the month right, but not the year.

Countries opted to delay the NZF adoption vote to October 2026, which could push its implementation down the road to 2030.

In the meantime, America’s NZF opposition is another example of its distrust of the UN.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.

John Lightbourn, a commercial shipping financier and the founder of U.S.-based Cavalier Shipping, suggested that the NZF implementation delay “could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — perhaps an acknowledgment that the IMO and, in turn, the UN, might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.”

He added that waning U.S. financial support for the UN raises questions about where funds collected under the NZF would end up and “whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the UN’s operating budget.”

Shipping consultant Darren Shelton agreed that delaying NZF implementation might be better in the long run.

In a LinkedIn post, the Moran Shipping Agencies sales director wrote that “the postponement, while frustrating, may be the only responsible choice.”

He maintained that it would provide “a pause long enough to ask whether the IMO’s traditional structure can still manage a borderless industry shaped by private enterprise and accelerating technology.”

Shelton added that “progress in shipping has always depended on realism … Ports, fuels, and safety rules evolve through collaboration between practitioners, not speeches by politicians.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz highlighted the need to balance climate objectives with industrial competitiveness, sparking ongoing debates on how these targets will be financed.

As the EU races against a U.N. deadline and prepares for the COP30 climate summit, discussions are expected to focus on the financial mechanisms and flexibility needed to achieve this ambitious target.

“I have to say, the member states, the IMO representatives from the different diplomatic sectors, have been very engaging with us.","IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez is looking at silver linings after an extraordinary meeting of its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) last week delayed the adoption of a ground-breaking global levy on greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking to Seatrade Maritime News at WISTA’s AGM and Conference in Barcelona, Dominguez said it’s easy for critics to judge the IMO’s success based on the unexpected events at MEPC but IMO has over 70 years of improving ship safety, security, and shipping's green credentials, and remains a strong organisation with a large programme of work that is relevant to the industry.

“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting. That's why I say that we shouldn't be rated as an organisation in relation to the postponement that took place, but instead on the fact that — like everybody else right now — we are dealing with different changes, different geopolitical situations, and we need to adapt.

“We need to learn from these scenarios, adapt and move forward, and that's exactly what IMO is doing. Just this Monday, we continue the work on decarbonisation to address some of the concerns that were raised last week, related to how this is going to be implemented, how it's going to be managed, the administration of the fund, the certification, etc.”

Rather than that work taking place between adoption and entry into force of NZF, the work now takes place before its adoption. Given the contentious geopolitics around the meeting, Dominguez said the result was good.

“Whenever there were comments in the room… the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other. Those that had different views [were] in the same room, and we're not going to find the agreements right away, because we need to understand those comments. We need to address them with further discussions, with further data. That is how multilateralism continues to work, and is at the centre of everything that we do at IMO. So again, a silver lining — the member states are talking to each other.”

As a former chair of MEPC, the IMO’s environmental work is a pillar of Dominguez’s term as secretary general. Another topic he has given full support to is diversity in shipping, where progress has been slower than expected.

“The recent IMO-WISTA survey showed us that even though we have more participation and engagement with the survey , the numbers are not reflecting all the effort that has been put into it,” said Dominguez. Awareness of the issue and the survey have increased, but room for improvement remains.

In July, Dominguez presented IMO’s internal gender and diversity strategy to the IMO Council to help the secretariat and member states take action on diversity within their work. Areas of work across IMO such as revision of the STCW convention, decarbonisation, and autonomous ships are all opportunities to attract women and focus on the younger generation, he said.

“Progress is there. We just need to be relentless in not backing down, and whenever there are challenges, just continue to power through with the actions that were taken and demonstrate progress,” said Dominguez.

Behind the scenes at IMO, progress has also been made on the criminalisation of seafarers through diplomatic engagement with member states following guidelines set by the legal committee this year.

“I have to say, the member states, the IMO representatives from the different diplomatic sectors, have been very engaging with us. They provide their feedback once they contact the national authorities and that allows us to actually make progress in some of the cases.”

Dominguez said there was work to be done to enhance relationships and cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration for mutual benefit on a topic that is outside of IMO’s scope, but affects the shipping industry.

“We need to understand each other better in order to address situations like when seafarers are not able to get visas, or even shore leave because of migration policies,” said Dominguez.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltad6e73e3f41ec0ac/68fa62a1590d4612e22b3ff6/WISTA-AGM-2025-Credit-Emma-Howell.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-23 17:17:07.685245
