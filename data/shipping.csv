*********************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.

As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you.

This year’s Forum took place with physical attendance at the Eugenides Foundation and was broadcast live worldwide, attracting hundreds of viewers and Members from the Institute’s 27 international Branches.

In her opening remarks, Ms. Natalia Margioli-Komninou, Managing Director of HMC & ICS Greek Branch, reflected on the Branch’s 20-year journey of promoting education and professionalism. She highlighted its vital role in shaping generations of maritime professionals through knowledge-sharing and networking. Ms. Margioli emphasized the importance of the ICS community – a network built on trust, respect, and a shared passion for shipping – and presented two major new initiatives; The Company Membership Scheme allows organizations to connect, access professional training, and tap into ICS’s global network, creating growth opportunities for both individuals and companies. The partnership with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) offers management and leadership programmes that equip professionals with essential soft skills for success in today’s global markets.

Both aim to foster leadership development and enhance the professional capacity of individuals and organizations within the maritime industry. She concluded by reaffirming the Branch’s mission to continue growing alongside the sector and to uphold its core values of learning, collaboration, and excellence.

In his welcome address, Mr. Nikolas Tsavliris, Chairman of the ICS Greek Branch, spoke with heartfelt emotion and deep respect, describing the 20th ICS Annual Forum as not only a milestone but a moment for gratitude and reflection. He underlined the Forum’s role as a platform for meaningful discussion in today’s complex and fragmented world. Drawing inspiration from the original Greek concept of dialogos, Mr. Tsavliris highlighted that dialogue is not a contest of opinions, but a shared pursuit of understanding, the very essence of the ICS mission.

The panel discussion, moderated with great insight by Mr. Simon Ward, FICS, Director, Ursa Shipbrokers, brought together a distinguished lineup of speakers:

Mr. Polys V. Hajioannou, Chairman & CEO, Safe Bulkers Inc., and President, Cyprus Union of Shipowners

Mr. George G. Mangos, Principal, Interunity Group

Ms. Ismini Panagiotidi, CEO & Founder, Pavimar S.A. and Icon Energy Corp.

Ms. Milena Pappa, Board Member & Commercial Director, Star Bulk Carriers Corp.

Mr. Thanasis Martinos, Managing Director of Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd., contributed to the forum via a pre-recorded video message.

The conversation covered key pillars shaping the shipping industry today — market outlook, geopolitics, environmental regulation (IMO & emissions), and professional development.

In his remarks, Mr Martinos noted that shipping is going through challenging times, and highlighted early indications that freight rates for VLCCs, Capesize bulk carriers, and container ships are expected to be higher next year. He added that he believes future freight market forecasts will become increasingly accurate as AI-enhanced econometric modeling continues to evolve.

Mr Hajioannou highlighted that many shipowners remain skeptical of the current IMO Net-Zero Framework and emphasized the long-term strategic impact of China’s dominance in shipbuilding. He stressed the need for coordinated dialogue among leading maritime nations to manage this structural imbalance. He also described shipping as a dynamic industry offering exceptional opportunities for professional growth. Mr Mangos cautioned against adopting unrealistic decarbonisation targets and noted that geopolitical volatility makes long-term commercial planning challenging. He highlighted the differing capacities of the liner and tramp sectors to influence global policy and stressed the importance of navigating market interdependencies carefully.

Ms Pappa focused on the technical and regulatory challenges facing decarbonisation, including green fuel incentives, lifecycle assessments, and fuel costs. She highlighted progress made through engine efficiency improvements but stressed the need for modern port infrastructure and scalable alternative fuels. Last, she highligted that personal integrity and transparency, alongside technical competence, are essential for anyone seeking a career in shipping. Ms Panagiotidi noted how commercial decision-making now requires constant adaptation to geopolitical uncertainty. She added that shipowners have historically had to make decisions under disruption, and recent developments have further shaken traditional decision-making frameworks in the industry. She observed that formal qualifications remain essential, but success increasingly depends on navigating complex markets with skill and foresight.

A US-led coalition scuppered the IMO’s attempts to agree a comprehensive road map that would see shipping substantially reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of those recorded in 2008.

The IMO set out a clear pathway to 2050 with interim targets for 2030 and 2040 with many nation states already committed to delivering the reductions in emissions and many vessel operators investing in the green technology that will achieve the industry’s goals.

In a move that will find support from many in the maritime sector, five NGO’s, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, have set out a six-point action plan that they are calling on governments to commit to in a bid to make sure that the maritime meets its climate obligations.

The plan calls for governments to: Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions. Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels. Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition. Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification. Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations and support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping.

Postponement of the NZF was a disappointment for many within and outside the industry but John Yum, head of shipping team at Solutions for Our Climate, argues that individual states can still take action to reduce emissions by expanding green corridors or investing in zero or near zero fuels. He said: “Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.” Meanwhile, Pacific Environment believe that overshooting the Paris target of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5degs has already been missed and blames “bad actors” for “bullying” countries into inaction.

Brazil was confident global unity would prevail at November's climate talks, but the exceptionally undiplomatic scenes at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN shipping regulator, presented an uglier possibility.

Even with the United States skipping the climate summit, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for good faith negotiations at COP30 and a rejection of the ""pressure and threats"" witnessed at the IMO.

Washington's conduct -- threatening sanctions, visa freezes and port levies on nations that didn't vote its way -- was not ""typical"" of the IMO, Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told AFP.

AFP interviewed Dominguez, a Panamanian nearly halfway through his four-year term as IMO chief, at COP30 in Belem. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: The shipping carbon price was expected to be approved until US officials threatened retaliation against nations to get the vote delayed. Is this normal conduct at the IMO?

A: ""In my 28 years I have never experienced that kind of meeting at the IMO. It was not a typical IMO meeting. Geopolitical situations around the world right now are different to where they were in the past. We all know that.

""But for me, the task is to keep the momentum, maintain the approach, and whenever we come back to the negotiations in future, I call on everyone to do it in the normal spirit of compromise and cooperation that we carry out at IMO.""

Q: How can the IMO's 176 member states rebuild trust after this?

A: ""I can tell you that multilateralism is very much alive at IMO. And that's what I told everyone -- not to judge the organization, or come too quickly to conclusions, from the outcome of one specific topic in one specific meeting.

""For us, we need to learn from it. I am very much in support of multilateralism. We have had conversations and discussions about how to deal with geopolitical aspects.""

Q: US President Donald Trump called the shipping emissions deal a ""scam"" and pressure from Washington clearly influenced its delay. Is the scheme dead?

A: ""The negotiations continue, and they are ongoing. It is by no means a done deal. The process will continue ahead.

""It is important to take their comments and concerns on board, and have further bilateral and multilateral conversations ahead of the next session. They may have proposals to put on the table for us to consider as well. And that's how we make progress.

""I work with all countries, and all governments, at any given time. My job is to listen to what everybody is saying and see how we can accommodate and find those common areas that might allow us to make progress.""

Q: Is the industry still committed to decarbonizing?

A: ""Our goal -- that we all agree at IMO back in 2023 -- is to decarbonize the sector by around 2050. And we all maintain that goal, regardless of the state of play right now. We continue to make progress... and I am convinced actually that the organization is serious about decarbonizing by around 2050.""

Pinnington released the latest edition of Making Waves November 4 through publisher Rethink Press.

Pinnington said the book is the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews. It also includes a new in-depth section on the U.S. maritime industry, as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.

“Maritime now has its highest profile in decades, and this is an opportunity and threat,” he said. “As we have seen with President Trump challenging China’s maritime industry and with the IMO Net Zero framework being paused, maritime is now front and center of the news agenda.”

Companies within the maritime industry historically have endeavored to keep a low profile, but that approach may need to change, Pinnington argues in “Making Waves.”

“Times have changed, and maritime needs to start prioritizing professional communications to build authentic reputation and trust,” he said.

A big part of that story is the industry-wide effort and cost associated with decarbonization and how technology and alternative fuels are driving down emissions.

Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.

“I want ‘Making Waves II’ to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said. “The hard reality is that many maritime firms do not have the reputation they deserve. They are trapped in repeating the same year with minimal growth and average marketing. However, if you communicate authentic good behavior on digital media and in the abundant maritime press, your reputation will rise. And research has shown that, with a stronger reputation, your business is more likely to grow.”

The new edition of “Making Waves” features interviews with leading industry figures like Marina Hadjipateras and Nir Gartzman, marine autonomy specialist Jack Dougherty, entrepreneur Darren Shelton, Texas maritime figure Niels Aalund, American maritime lawyer Charlie Papavizas, Great Lakes maritime professionals Ian Hirt and William Friedman, inland waterways specialist Scott Sigman and PR thought leader Stephen Waddington.

Polaris Media is a maritime and engineering specialist PR firm. Pinnington founded the company in Liverpool, UK, in 2011. Pinnington expanded the company to Chicago in 2022. Polaris has worked for more than 100 clients, including ship builders, boat builders, hovercraft builders, shipping lines, ports, flag states, classification societies, equipment makers, cybersecurity firms, professional service companies, seafarer charities and trade associations. The firm has clients in the United States, United Kingdom, India and Europe.

Polaris helped to recharter the Chicago chapter of the International Propeller Club in 2023. Following a 15-year hiatus, the club was named International Port Chapter of the Year in 2024.

As informed, the engine uses the Diesel principle combined with dual-fuel Liquid Gas Injection technology, similar to prior engines running on methanol and LPG. The engine incorporates safety features specific to ammonia, including containment systems, sensors, system ventilation, and double-walled piping.

Ammonia as a marine fuel has several technical advantages, Everllence explains. It produces zero CO₂ when derived from renewable sources and has low sulphur-oxide and particulate emissions. Its high volumetric energy density allows more compact storage compared with hydrogen, and it can be stored as a liquid at moderate pressures. Ammonia’s slow combustion rate is compatible with two-stroke engine designs, and existing global production infrastructure supports scalability and operational reliability.

The first engine is expected to be operational in 2026, with testing and bedding-in scheduled beforehand. Extensive testing has already been conducted, including over 800 trials since mid-2023, with safety measures reviewed alongside relevant authorities.

The ME-LGIA engine will support digital connectivity to allow real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and operational data collection.

As the maritime industry’s leading engine designer, we are in a unique position to advance the green transition and know that bringing new fuels to market is not just innovation – it’s imperative for zero-carbon shipping. In this context, ammonia is a vital piece of the puzzle. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement; it is another concrete step towards a climate-neutral future where the time to act is now

According to Besley-Gould, SSI continues to deliver on its road map set across six key areas-- oceans, people, community, finance, transparency and energy, including Scope 3 emissions.
Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.
Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.
SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said.","A clear opportunity exists to expand the maritime sector's decarbonization focus to the embodied environmental impacts of ship materials, beginning with the circularity potential of steel and pathways toward greener steel, said Ellie Besley-Gould, CEO of the Sustainable Shipping Initiative.

""A huge transition is happening, with genuine market signals from the industry to achieve maritime decarbonization,"" Besley-Gould told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview.

""Our members, who include very forward-thinking industry players, are leading the industry by acting on their carbon footprint and are calling upon the SSI to identify and fill in gaps where uncertainty remains,"" she said via an e-mail on Nov. 13.

According to Besley-Gould, SSI continues to deliver on its road map set across six key areas-- oceans, people, community, finance, transparency and energy, including Scope 3 emissions.

So, SSI is also focusing on ship life cycle management, among other aspects, she said.

Steel is the dominant material in ships, accounting for about 70%-90% of a ship's total mass and driving one of the largest shares of Scope 3 emissions, factoring in extraction, refining and manufacturing, Besley-Gould said.

As a major wave of ship retirements approaches, about 150 million metric tons of ship steel will become available for recycling before 2032, she said, adding that this was a ""strategic climate lever"" that falls within this decade rather than after 2050.

According to Besley-Gould, with the Hong Kong Convention entering into force in 2025, a global minimum standard is now in place, providing greater confidence to invest in upgraded recycling capacity.

Using recovered marine steel in electric arc furnace production can reduce life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared with using new primary steel made from iron ore. However, today, the system mostly fails to capture that benefit, she said.

Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.

One of the major hurdles is timing, according to Besley-Gould.

End-of-life decisions are often made in the last months of operation when the original owner has already lost leverage, she said. At that point, recycling becomes a cost rather than an opportunity, she said.

""On the demand side, what we need to see is fleet owners looking for green steel in their supply chain... And on the supply side, we would love ship owners to be thinking about recycling ships at midlife instead of end-of-life so that we can start well,"" she added.

Circularity is most achievable when embedded from design through to end-of-life, not just at the point of recycling, she said.

Coordination across the shipping and steel sectors, supported by global and regional regulations, and de-risking demand-generating policies are also vital to close material loops, she added.

Additionally, SSI is undertaking significant work on marine biodiversity and ocean health. This includes linking biofouling to energy efficiency, the impact of slow steaming on underwater radiated noise and whale strikes, as well as human impact, such as the mariners' welfare, Besley-Gould said.

Shipping's transformative pathway

The delay in the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework ratification was disappointing, Besley-Gould said.

""The IMO MEPC83 outcome has, of course, maintained a level of uncertainty... There is still unpredictability over whether it is possible to have an incentivization scheme and whether the reward mechanism is appropriate, what it should ideally look like, and how the carbon tax proceeds would be spent,"" she said.

""I think while the mechanism would have accelerated the transition, it is nevertheless underway,"" she said, adding that a huge opportunity exists for shipping to not just transform itself but become a transformative industry that inspires others.

SSI is working with its members to explore how best to support net zero while continuing to deliver on its road map, she said.

""Although SSI remains fuel-agnostic, it highlights a wide range of alternative fuels under consideration -- from LNG and bio-based fuels to methanol, ammonia and synthetic options -- underscoring the need to evaluate each on sustainability criteria across the full fuel life cycle,"" she added.

""If we can combine energy efficiency with clean fuels, then there is kind of a double win,"" she said, referring to measures such as slow steaming, wind sails, hull coating and bubble lubrication.

Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.

In 2023, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach unveiled a partnership strategy for a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor across the Pacific Ocean.

SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said. ""So, how would slow steaming not only reduce emissions but also noise levels and whale strikes? Can one also implement human-side excellence and track crew welfare?""

""It will be exciting when we see emissions data and other things that the GDSCs are measuring, to extrapolate it to scale and see what is possible,"" she added.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:09.012803

We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping.
The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality.
The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.” Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action.
Full Report Sources: Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment","On Energy and Transport Day at COP 30, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment call on national governments to urgently accelerate action to reduce shipping emissions, especially following the recent U.S.-led postponement in the adoption of a binding global shipping measure at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonisation efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the IMO’s 2023 Strategy sets a clear pathway to achieve net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040 that countries have already committed to deliver. While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward.

We therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonisation:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate, said: “The postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is deeply disappointing, but it also gives governments a chance to take meaningful action. Instead of just waiting for international negotiations to resume, countries like Korea should take immediate steps to decarbonize their shipping sectors — for instance, by continuing to commit to expanding green shipping corridors and increasing investment in ZNZ fuels. Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.”

Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, said: “We now face a reality we long anticipated — overshooting the 1.5°C target is inevitable. Member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed. We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping. There is only one planet. We must stand together for the health of our ocean and for future generations. Now is the time to act.”

Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund, said: “The development and deployment of clean, alternative fuels for global shipping is not only good for stabilizing the climate and improving public health—it also creates economic opportunities for those countries and companies that embrace innovation. The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.”

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action. In the face of the climate crisis, countries need to start taking leaps, not steps, towards decarbonising shipping, including addressing short-lived climate pollutants such as methane and black carbon. Meanwhile, bullying tactics must be called out and multilateralism must take precedence. Steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.”

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.

Early preparation around these regimes is closely tied to maintaining their competitive position.

Ahead of his contribution to the Tanker 2030 conference in Singapore, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore global market leader for tankers Robert Elliot described how operators had to make informed choices on fuel sourcing and pooling, alongside carefully managing operational performance.

He set out two main pathways for owners: securing access to sustainable fuels, which offers greater control and relative stability, or joining pooling agreements that provide flexibility but depend on robust contracts to manage price volatility.

Mr Elliot noted the best balance between these approaches depends on a vessel’s trading profile and fuel options, including access to alternative energy sources, and the ability to anticipate and model these factors had become a commercial capability rather than a narrow compliance task.

The extraordinary meeting is to be resumed in 12 months. In the meantime, the member states want to continue working towards a consensus on the regulations.

The IMO's net zero framework was included as a new chapter in the draft revision of Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) at the 83rd session of the MEPC in April 2025. However, without the USA, which did not attend this meeting.

The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations. Promoting ""activist-driven climate policies"" under the IMO net-zero framework could lead to sanctions, tariffs, port fees, economic sanctions related to US government contracts or visa restrictions for seafarers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned in a joint statement ahead of the meeting.

From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"". This is because, by and large, the new net zero framework, even if it is not usually discussed as a ""tax"", will be the first and only global financial sanction for carbon emissions. The US announcement then includes a rather blunt threat to penalise countries that vote in favour of the IMO's carbon tax scheme by imposing costs on them.

Speaking at the 19th Greener Shipping Summit on Tuesday, the head of the Marine Technical Managers Association (Martecma), Panos Kourkountis, argued that “with the technology we have now, we can reduce emissions by 50%.
“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels.
Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

Speaking at the 19th Greener Shipping Summit on Tuesday, the head of the Marine Technical Managers Association (Martecma), Panos Kourkountis, argued that “with the technology we have now, we can reduce emissions by 50%. Unless we have new technologies, we must move forward with what we have now.”

Kourkountis, who is also the Technical Director at Sea Traders, explained that only 1% of the amount of fuel required for shipping by the controversial IMO Net-Zero Framework that got postponed in October is available at this time, and producing that fuel is not something we could do “the very next day,” he emphasized, adding that the energy required to produce ammonia and methanol would be greater than the energy they generate.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels. We do not have energy from batteries, while nuclear energy is not ready to be applied, even though it would certainly solve the global energy problem, but environmentally the problem remains, since nuclear waste exists,” he said.

Echoing those views, ABS Business Development Manager Angelos Minakis presented the key points of contention in IMO, saying the organization has made a strategic mistake by condemning liquefied natiural gas while theoretically other fuels don’t exist. Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

For his part, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, vice president and CEO of Skaramangas Shipyards, argued that US opposition to IMO’s Net-Zero Framework poses a unique opportunity for the Greek shipbuilding industry, especially for Skaramangas, as the shipyards will be certified next year to serve LNG carriers and such vessels are expected to travel the Eastern Mediterranean region to export American LNG.

The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality.
Leaders can and must act now to implement it.
As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.
… the NGOs concluded.","According to a statement by Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, the U.S.-led postponement delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonization efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward. The NGOs therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonization:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback

… said John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate

Meanwhile, Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, highlighted that member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed.

The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today

… commented Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, expressed the opinion that steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.

The European Union (EU), the Port of Rotterdam and the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport) have signed a deal to advance the expansion of Lüderitz Port at Angra Point.

The agreement forms part of the EU–Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chains and renewable hydrogen.

Under the deal, the EU has committed N$13 million to support planning for the port’s expansion.

The agreement was signed during the closing session of its Africa regional workshop on Global Gateway Green Shipping Corridors in Walvis Bay.

Maritime transport must undergo rapid change to cut emissions, European Union (EU) ambassador to Namibia Ana Beatriz Martins told delegates at the workshop.

She said the sector’s contribution to global emissions demands urgent action from governments and industry.

She addressed representatives from African partnership countries, the International Maritime Organisation, the African Union Commission, port authorities and private operators.

The discussions come as world leaders gather at the 30th Conference of Parties (COP30) climate conference in Belém, Brazil.

The workshop is the first of three regional sessions to be held worldwide. Martins said hosting it in Namibia shows Europe’s confidence in African partners and Namibia’s growing role in green shipping.

“No better place than Namibia to show us the way on green shipping,” she said.

She outlined the long-standing cooperation between the EU, IMO, and African countries across transport sectors, such as roads, rail, aviation safety, and sustainable fuels.

She said these partnerships have strengthened mobility and connectivity on the continent.

Martins reminded delegates of the urgency of the climate crisis.

The EU has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution for 2035, committing to cut emissions by 66% to 72% and aiming to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

She noted that Europe remains the world’s largest provider of climate finance, with €31.7 billion contributed in 2024 and €11 billion in private finance for developing countries.

Last week at COP30, President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah revealed that Namibia would require about US$15 billion, or roughly N$270 billion, to meet its climate mitigation and adaptation goals by 2030.

Most of this funding would rely on international support.

Namibia’s adaptation efforts in agriculture, water, health, biodiversity and infrastructure would require about US$6 billion (around N$108 billion), with 90% expected to come from external sources.

Its mitigation measures were projected to cost about US$9 billion (roughly N$162 billion), with 10% expected to be financed locally.

Martina said momentum toward decarbonising shipping remains strong, despite the IMO’s delayed decision on the Net Zero Framework.

She said the EU wants to support long-term competitiveness and economic growth across Africa and Europe through cleaner shipping routes.

She also pointed out challenges, such as geopolitical pressures, high investment costs, renewable fuel prices, and limited infrastructure.

The Global Gateway’s Green Shipping Corridors initiative responds to requests from shippers, fuel producers, port operators, and maritime authorities.

Martins said the long-term goal is to establish shipping routes powered by renewable fuels and supported by ports able to supply clean energy. She said this transition requires robust financing.

Erongo governor Natalia |Goagoses welcomed the delegates from across Africa to the workshop, which was held under the theme “Accelerating Inclusive Green Shipping in Africa: Energy Efficiency, Innovation and Finance for a Low-Carbon Maritime Future.”

She praised the International Maritime Organization, the European Union and MTCC Africa for supporting sustainable and inclusive maritime development.",https://www.observer24.com.na/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cropped-WO-App-Icon-Apple-1-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 06:57:15.359762

The Singapore bunkering sector is supported by three LNG bunker vessels, is also actively delivering bio bunker fuels, and backed by storage terminals ready for methanol and ammonia.
Join the Conversation With over 300 delegates expected, the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 is set to be a defining moment for the marine fuels industry.","The Port of Long Beach on Tuesday (11 November) said the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners voted unanimously to approve a cooperative agreement with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Port of Los Angeles containing time-bound and enforceable commitments to develop zero-emissions infrastructure at the nation’s largest ports complex.

The enforceable agreement requires the ports to develop and implement charging and fuelling infrastructure plans and includes annual reporting requirements and agency oversight.

The agreement, which the SCAQMD Board approved 7 November, commits the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to developing and implementing plans for zero-emissions infrastructure for equipment types in three phases, starting with a draft plan in May 2027, followed by approved plans in place for all categories by the end of 2029.

According to SCAQM, the cooperative agreement prioritises the development of zero-emission infrastructure at the Ports—the first critical step towards eliminating emissions from cargo handling equipment, harbour craft, trucks, trains, and ocean-going vessels and attaining clean air in the region.

Taken together, the actions build on the voluntary, landmark Clean Air Action Plan that has delivered remarkable progress in cutting emissions from port-related sources, including reductions of 90% in diesel particulate matter, 68% in nitrogen oxides and 98% in sulphur oxides from port-related sources since 2005.

In the months ahead, the ports will also continue working with SCAQMD on additional “CAAP Plus” measures that will focus on emission-reducing strategies related to cleaner oceangoing vessels, the largest source of emissions at the ports, through strategies like the Environmental Ship Index Incentive Programs.

The measures could also include strategies like committing Clean Truck Fund Rate revenue to subsidise the transition to zero-emission trucks and infrastructure, developing a zero-emissions drayage truck utilisation incentive program and consulting annually with SCAQMD on spending priorities.

“We are pleased to move forward with this cooperative agreement and accelerate the progress we’ve achieved by making our operations cleaner and more efficient,” said Long Beach Harbor Commission President Frank Colonna. “It will deliver tangible results and a sustainable future without risking jobs or cargo throughput.”

“I commend the South Coast Air Quality Management District for its willingness to compromise, and all of the work by staff from the agency and both ports in recent months to develop this agreement in a transparent and open process,” said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero.

“Collaboration has been a key to our success in reducing environmental impacts. Together, with the participation and active support of the ports, SCAQMD, labor, industry, energy suppliers and utilities, technology developers and community representatives – which this agreement will intensify – I am confident we can reach our shared goal of a zero-emissions future.”

“Environmental progress and economic leadership are no longer competing goals – they must move forward together,” said Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson.

“This collaborative agreement marks a major step toward a more sustainable port complex that protects community health, advances our climate action commitments and strengthens regional economic growth with good-paying jobs. By accelerating zero-emission infrastructure, we will deliver cleaner air, healthier neighbourhoods and a greener global supply chain that reaches far beyond our two cities.”

EnviTec Biogas on Thursday (13 November) said TT-Line signed a bio-LNG supply contract following a trial bunkering.

Some 40 metric tonnes (mt) of bio-LNG from EnviTec Biogas was supplied to TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferry Peter Pan in Travemünde, Germany.

“We are delighted to be able to supply TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferries, a combination of passenger and vehicle ships, with our renewable fuel bio-LNG,” said Markus Pille, Managing Director of EnviTec Energy GmbH & Co. KG.

Since the entry into force of the EU Regulation on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, also known as FuelEU Maritime, shipping companies such as TT-Line are required to comply with binding limits for the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The regulation applies to all ships in the EU with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 in commercial passenger or freight transport, regardless of the flag they fly.

“Our Peter Pan, together with her sister ship Nils Holgersson, is the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferry in the world. These ferries represent far more to us than merely meeting legal requirements; we are preparing ourselves and our fleet as well as possible for a sustainable future,” said Torben Nikolay, CFO of TT-Line.

“We have already carried out extensive bio-LNG bunkerings by bunker barge this year and are now pleased to have found, in EnviTec Biogas, a German partner for particularly flexible bunkering by truck.”

Hong Lam Marine, an industry staple for over 40 years, has always aimed to keep pace or even lead the Singapore bunkering sector. We were amongst the first to build and in June 2005 introduced the 9,330 dwt Leadership which was then Singapore’s largest bunker tanker. Today, we operate the 9,338 dwt Oracle which is the largest in Singapore (as per MPA data on 8 September 2025).

Though we are concerned about alternative marine fuels due to high building costs and uncertainty about the dominant fuel, we are still planning newbuildings including IMO Type II bunker tankers to deliver alternative fuels to keep pace with the market.

Even so, it remains uncertain what alternative fuels will dominate the bunkering market, as most shipowners are building dual-fuel vessels enabling them to switch to conventional bunker fuels if prices are too high or when supply is limited.

MT: Can you describe the challenges Hong Lam Marine faced during IMO 2020 and how lessons learned have prepared it for upcoming IMO 2030?

The IMO 2020 Global Sulphur Cap provided a clear regulation with a definite compliance date, creating a level playing field.

However, we lack such clarity with alternative fuels; the failure of the MEPC extraordinary session in October 2025 on the net-zero framework was a setbac k. We hope for consensus next year to approve the net-zero framework and the mechanics agreed by 2028-2029, which would provide investment clarity for the bunkering industry.

To date, we have observed shipowners building dual-fuel vessels predominantly powered by methanol, some ammonia, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Until global regulations are in place, biofuels and LNG will likely be the main transition fuels, as a lack of a level playing field impedes investment.

MT: What are your thoughts on mass flowmeters (MFM), electronic bunker delivery notes (e-BDN), and digitalisation for Singapore’s bunkering sector, and how does those set an example for marine refuelling in the rest of the world?

The best thing that ever happened to the Singapore bunkering industry is the MFM. It’s not only the MFM itself but also the whole piping system to ensure the quantity of fuel delivered is correct.

That really brought integrity to the Singapore bunkering and gave us a reputation, and it is through this reputation that allowed the local bunkering sector to thrive amongst global competition. The enforcement and compliance checks by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the MFM system are also crucial to its success.

A noteworthy fact is that Hong Lam Marine test-bedded MFM with ExxonMobil and MPA from 2010 to 2016, resulting in the company operating the certified for MFM custody transfer in Singapore when MFM bunkering for fuel oil became mandatory in 2017.

The adoption of e-BDNs for Singapore’s bunkering sector was successful because the MPA listened to industry feedback. We are currently in Phase One of e-BDN, with the next phase hopefully being full digitalisation to integrate banks, suppliers, buyers, sellers, operators, and MPA, ensuring transparency and integrity when you bunker in Singapore.

MT: Based on your experience as SSA’s president from 2019 to 2025, how prepared is Singapore’s bunkering industry to tackle IMO 2030 and beyond?

Singapore is more than ready. With the involvement of Hong Lam Marine, we were the first to conduct ship-to-ship methanol bunkering and thereafter, MPA has since implemented simultaneous operations for cargo discharge and methanol bunker supply.

The Singapore bunkering sector is supported by three LNG bunker vessels, is also actively delivering bio bunker fuels, and backed by storage terminals ready for methanol and ammonia.

The MPA is proactive, and the SSA president has a seat on the MPA board, ensuring Singapore stays relevant and invests in future trends. The Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA) has trained many crew for methanol and is training for ammonia.

While Singapore is ready, the alternative fuels future resets the bunkering landscape, and we must continue to innovate to maintain our position as the world’s top bunkering port.

Singapore-headquartered crude and product tankers owner AET on Monday (10 November) said it has signed shipbuilding agreements with Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) for the construction of two LNG dual-fuel Suezmax tankers.

The vessels will further expand AET’s growing dual-fuel fleet operating worldwide. With these orders, AET will have dual-fuel capability in all the tanker sectors it operates in – Aframaxes, Shuttle Tankers, Suezmaxes and Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs).

Each vessel will feature advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and environmental performance, including:

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) .

In addition to these savings, LNG from alternative feedstocks namely bio-LNG and e-LNG offer a long-term and scalable solution to deep decarbonisation for the industry. These forms of LNG while nascent in their use as marine fuel offer significant incremental GHG emissions savings beyond (fossil) LNG based savings and utilise the same infrastructure .

Nick Potter, President & CEO of AET, said: “This marks another important step in building a more sustainable fleet and supporting our customers’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these newbuilds, our dual-fuel fleet will grow to 18 vessels , a clear demonstration of the progress we’re making in delivering more energy with less emissions.

“Through continued collaboration with industry partners, we’re investing in technologies that deliver lower-carbon energy solutions today while keeping firmly on course towards a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 as part of our Energy Transition Strategy.”
