But there is much more than shipping at stake, Duffy and Rubio said.
""This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world,"" wrote Duffy and Rubio.
In a statement, Rubio and Duffy said that the administration unequivocally rejects the MEPC proposal and will ""not tolerate"" it.
Our fellow IMO members should be on notice,"" Rubio and Duffy warned.","The Trump administration is threatening to deploy some of its biggest legal penalties against countries that back the Marine Environment Protection Committee's draft CO2 emissions regulations, which are up for a final vote text week. Promoting the ""activist-driven climate policies"" in the IMO Net Zero Framework could result in sanctions, tariffs, port fees or crew visa restrictions, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned in a joint statement Friday.

In the administration's view, the framework amounts to a ""European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations."" This dramatic framing might seem disproportionate to the size of the sector, which accounts for just three percent of global CO2 and barely flickered on U.S. policymakers' radars in years past. But there is much more than shipping at stake, Duffy and Rubio said. In the big picture, though it is not usually discussed as a ""tax,"" the new Net Zero Framework will be the first and only global financial penalty of any kind for carbon emissions. If enacted, it would be a symbol of non-U.S. opinion on climate change and a new goal post for measuring every other industry's emissions.

""This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world,"" wrote Duffy and Rubio. ""President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.""

In a statement, Rubio and Duffy said that the administration unequivocally rejects the MEPC proposal and will ""not tolerate"" it. An estimated 10 percent hike in global shipping cost from the carbon fee structure is too much to bear, they warned, and could be ""disastrous.""

To penalize countries that vote for the IMO carbon tax system, Rubio and Duffy laid out a menu of options that could be brought to bear, to include:

- Sanctions on individual officials

- Additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by countries supporting the Net Zero Framework

- Investigations of ""anti-competitive practices"" and potential blocking of vessels from certain flagged countries, measures which would require the participation of the Federal Maritime Commission

- Visa restrictions on C-1/D maritime crewmember visas

- Commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts

""We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.

In 2025, emissions trading under the EU ETS alone is expected to add more than $6bn in costs to global shipping. By the end of the decade, a mix of regional and global carbon pricing schemes could lift that bill above $50bn a year, according to cost projections from shipping emissions analytics company Siglar Carbon.

The total includes overlapping measures such as the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, UK ETS, and the IMO’s upcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measure, set to take effect from 2028.

If all schemes coexist and other countries follow the EU’s lead with local emission taxes, the total annual carbon bill for shipping could climb toward $100bn by 2030, the Norway-based company noted.

Forecasts from LSEG Research project that European carbon prices could reach $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, amplifying the cost burden for operators and charterers still dependent on conventional fuels.

“When carbon is priced, it changes the game — from chartering to ship finance,” Siglar analysts said, noting that emissions now carry a measurable commercial value on every voyage.

The IMO’s GFI will effectively introduce a global carbon layer across all international shipping. Estimates suggest it could generate $22bn in compliance costs when it enters into force in 2028, rising to $33bn two years later.

The open question for regulators and the industry is whether the IMO’s global framework will replace or stack on top of regional schemes. If it becomes another layer rather than a harmonised solution, shipping faces a fragmented, multi-tier carbon regime that could penalise some trades more than others.

For shipowners and operators, carbon pricing has shifted from an environmental metric to a core commercial variable. It now influences time charter equivalent (TCE) returns, voyage planning, and contract terms. For financiers and insurers, carbon exposure is emerging as a new category of operational and credit risk — one that must be tracked and priced with the same precision as freight volatility or bunker costs.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/FuelTrust-pollution.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:56:15.899327

Labour Party climate spokesperson Deborah Russell said it could impact New Zealand's trading reputation.
'Missed opportunity' - climate scientist University of Canterbury professor of physics David Frame was one of five experts on the government-appointed science panel reviewing on biogenic methane targets.
""I think if they'd been a little more far sighted, they could have put a small price on agricultural methane emissions and then they would have been in a position to say to the rest of the world, we have a price on agricultural methane emissions and you don't.
The government will pass an amendment bill - legislating the new biogenic methane target - before the end of the year.","The coalition has missed an opportunity to price agricultural methane emissions, as it moves to slash the country's biogenic methane target, a climate scientist says.

The government has cut the biogenic methane reduction target to 14 to 24 percent below 2017 levels by 2050. The previous target was a range of 24 to 47 percent.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said the lower range would give farmers certainty while keeping the country on track to meet its other climate commitments.

""It is really, really important as a government that we want to provide certainty to our agricultural sector and the adjustment that we're making in terms of changing the methane target to 14 to 24 percent is fair and pragmatic,"" he said

In weighing up a new target, the government had to decide whether to embrace a 'no additional warming' approach - cutting just enough to hold methane's heating effect steady at a fixed point - or hold the line on more ambitious cuts, brought in by the former Labour government.

ACT leader David Seymour hailed the decision as a win for his party, saying it's about time his coalition partners caught up to him on climate policy.

""I voted alone against the entire parliament when these targets were introduced. I'm thrilled seven years later to see a reality check.

""It makes no sense to drive New Zealand farmers out of business so their competitors overseas can serve the same customers with higher emissions. That's the definition of a lose-lose.""

Both Labour and the Green Party have condemned the move, arguing the cut will cost the country in the long term.

Labour Party climate spokesperson Deborah Russell said it could impact New Zealand's trading reputation.

""My concern is not so much the emissions themselves, but the political and economic signals it sends; it says that we're not prepared to do our bit and because of that we could be compromised in terms of our markets.""

Green Party co-leader and climate change spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said there was a lot more than just the markets on the line.

""This methane denial betrays farmers who are on the front line of climate-driven extreme weather events that threaten global food production and rural livelihoods.""

'Missed opportunity' - climate scientist

University of Canterbury professor of physics David Frame was one of five experts on the government-appointed science panel reviewing on biogenic methane targets.

He said the old target was far too ambitious, given it was widely accepted the world was about to go ""zooming by"" the 1.5 degree global warming target.

""It was never very realistic, [the former Labour government] plucked that target because it was ambitious but that I don't think it was particularly well thought through.

""Now you're seeing a bunch of other countries and entities who made ambitious pronouncements a few years ago begin to see the writing on the wall.

""It's sad and it's not great but it was always a bit of a mistake to hardwire in legislative targets around 1.5 degree Paris [target], which is the lower end of the Paris Agreement target range, just because it was never very plausible.""

Frame said the new target was more realistic, though he was critical of the government for deciding against pricing agricultural methane emissions, saying decision makers had bowed to the farming lobby.

""I think if they'd been a little more far sighted, they could have put a small price on agricultural methane emissions and then they would have been in a position to say to the rest of the world, we have a price on agricultural methane emissions and you don't.

""That is a form of leadership, actual practical policy leadership, not just grand pronouncements or what about what the world would be like in 2050 which are pretty meaningless.

""It was a missed opportunity and I also think they could have gone some way to assuaging the concerns of people who think this is a retrenchment from climate policy.""

A meteorologist from Environment and Climate Change Canada said the colder temperatures are brought by a sharp cold front coming off a low-pressure system.
“It’s basically bringing in a colder air mass, which has been situated to the north,” said Rob Griffith on Saturday.
While Calgary had its warmest September on record this year, Griffith said it’s normal to start seeing colder temperatures by the middle of October.
“It’s not like it’s winter for good, yet, but it’s kind of the first taste of those temperatures,” Griffith said.","After a mostly mild start to fall, Calgarians can expect colder temperatures over the Thanksgiving weekend, as well as the first snowfall of the season.

The Weather Network is forecasting afternoon highs of zero and -1C on Sunday and Monday, with overnight lows dipping down to -2C and -5C on those two days, respectively.

A mixture of rain and snow was in the forecast for Saturday night .

A meteorologist from Environment and Climate Change Canada said the colder temperatures are brought by a sharp cold front coming off a low-pressure system.

“It’s basically bringing in a colder air mass, which has been situated to the north,” said Rob Griffith on Saturday. “You’ll notice, (Saturday night), strong northerly winds and that’s bringing in that air mass.

“Then there’s precipitation along the front that will start off to rain and should change to snow as temperatures drop, which in Calgary should be around the night, give or take an hour.”

Environment and Climate Change Canada issued snowfall warnings Saturday morning for areas west of Calgary, including Kananaskis, Banff and Lake Louise. Anywhere from five to 20 centimetres of snow is expected to fall this weekend, depending on location.

“Elevation makes a big difference, so higher areas west of Calgary in particular will have some fairly significant accumulation this weekend, but in Calgary itself, we’re not expecting (much),” Griffith said. “That precipitation will start as rain, whereas in the mountain, you’re cooler already just by being higher up, so it takes less to drop to freezing.”

Snow is also expected along other travel routes through the Rockies, including portions of the Trans-Canada Highway, which the federal agency is saying may make travel hazardous.

While Calgary had its warmest September on record this year, Griffith said it’s normal to start seeing colder temperatures by the middle of October.

“Going forward, I would never rule out snow in September in Calgary,” he said. “It’s maybe becoming less likely with climate change but it’s still a possibility.”

For those who haven’t done so already, he said it’s likely time to turn on furnaces and winterize backyards and houses.

“It’s not like it’s winter for good, yet, but it’s kind of the first taste of those temperatures,” Griffith said.

However, he noted temperatures in Calgary are expected to bounce back to the positives by the middle of next week, with a high of 6C forecast for Tuesday and an afternoon high of 12C by next Thursday, according to The Weather Network.

The first panel discussion, “Winds of Change: Ministers at the Helm of Maritime Transformation,” of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference, took place earlier today.
More than 1,000 delegates took part in the international Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, held in Limassol from October 6 to October 8.","Here are the top business stories in Cyprus from the week starting October 6:

One of the government’s main goals, the qualitative and further strengthening of the Cypriot ship registry, has been achieved, president Nikos Christodoulides said on Sunday evening.

Speaking at a dinner at the presidential palace marking the start of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, he stated that the registry recorded an increase approaching twenty per cent over the past two years.

The president welcomed participants, expressing “great pleasure” at hosting the dinner and highlighting the importance of the biennial event, which was first organised in Cyprus in 1989.

He said that the conference has now been “firmly established as a significant institution both in Cyprus and in international maritime affairs and has been substantially upgraded in recent years, both in quality and scale”.

President Nikos Christodoulides on Monday said that one of the key priorities of the Cypriot Presidency of the EU Council is to ensure the competitiveness of European shipping.

He also spoke about the progress achieved by the Cypriot maritime sector, which has recorded robust growth over the past two years.

During his address at the opening of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol, the president said that the event’s title, “Unlocking the Future of Shipping”, reflects both today’s intricate challenges and the enduring resilience of the maritime industry.

He added that his presence at the conference demonstrates the importance his government places on the maritime sector.

Referring to Cypriot shipping, Christodoulides said that “the numbers speak for themselves“, emphasising that Cyprus holds one of the largest fleets in the world and operates across all shipping-related domains.

Cyprus’ shipping sector remains a cornerstone of the national economy, according to the president of the Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC) Andreas Neophytou.

Neophytou’s comments were delivered during a reception hosted by the chamber on Sunday, ahead of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 international conference.

An announcement from the chamber said the event brought together more than 800 guests, “underscoring the chamber’s prestige and the respect it commands both locally and internationally”.

Among those attending were ministers, members of parliament, diplomats, senior government officials, representatives of professional organisations, and top executives from the Cypriot and global shipping industry.

In his address, Neophytou welcomed attendees and highlighted the vital role of Cyprus’ shipping industry for the economy and global trade.

A high-level ministerial panel bringing together maritime leaders from Cyprus, Greece, Bahrain, and Qatar took place on Monday, as part of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference.

The first panel discussion, “Winds of Change: Ministers at the Helm of Maritime Transformation,” of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference, took place earlier today.

Ministers of Cyprus, Greece, the State of Qatar and the Kingdom of Bahrain responsible for maritime affairs shared valuable insights regarding the challenges that global shipping is facing.

They all agreed that by aligning policies regionally and deepening collaboration through multilateral platforms like the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), states can build a more resilient, fair, and sustainable maritime future.

The panel was moderated by Souzana Psara, business and finance reporter at the Cyprus Mail.

Participants included Shipping Deputy Minister of Cyprus Marina Hadjimanolis, Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy of Greece Vasilis Kikilias, Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications of Bahrain Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and Minister of Transport of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani.

Cyprus is set to take centre stage in shaping Europe’s future transport, shipping and tourism policies during its upcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union, according to European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

Addressing the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference in Limassol, he said the Cypriot Presidency “will be decisive for Europe and for transport policy,” noting that as a major maritime nation, Cyprus will help define the new EU Maritime Industrial Strategy, the EU Port Strategy and the Military Mobility Package.

He also revealed that the EU’s first-ever European Strategy for Tourism is expected “by Easter next year,” adding that Cyprus will play a key role in its development.

On the sidelines of the conference, Shipping Deputy Minister Marina Hadjimanolis met with the commissioner to discuss the ministry’s priorities ahead of the Presidency in 2026 and in light of the forthcoming European Industrial Maritime Strategy.

Cyprus, a country with more than six decades of maritime tradition, reaffirmed its role as a global shipping leader during the opening of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol on Monday.

Addressing delegates, Shipping Deputy Minister Marina Hadjimanolis welcomed ministers, shipowners and industry figures from around the world, saying it was “a great pleasure to welcome you all to Limassol, the capital of shipping, for Maritime Cyprus Conference 2025.”

She noted that the first Maritime Cyprus Conference was held in 1989, creating “a platform for global dialogue that has endured for decades.”

Today, she said, “the heart of international shipping beats strongly in Cyprus,” describing the event as “a celebration of the spirit, resilience, and enduring excellence of shipping.”

The minister also extended a warm welcome to her counterparts from India, Qatar, Bahrain, Greece, Poland and Malta, saying their presence “sends the strongest message, that shipping is the force that shapes the world, whether it’s ideas, products or goods, nothing changes until it moves.”

The Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) represented Cyprus at the Science and Technology for Society (STS) Forum 2025, held in Kyoto, Japan, on October 5–6, 2025.

According to an announcement released on Tuesday, chief scientist Demetris Skourides and RIF director general Theodoros Loukaidis held a series of high-level meetings with leading international figures in research and innovation.

During the forum, they met with Marcia McNutt, president of the US National Academy of Sciences, to discuss the need to redesign research evaluation systems.

The discussion focused on better use of knowledge and creating career opportunities for young researchers.

Paphos has emerged as one of Cyprus’ most dynamic property markets in the first half of 2025, according to a report released on Tuesday by Landbank Analytics.

The findings show that Paphos recorded a high number of apartment sales, while resale houses in the district remained among the most expensive on the island.

Specifically, a total of 203 apartment transactions were recorded in Paphos during the first six months of 2025, more than twice the number of house sales.

In addition, the average resale apartment price stood at €129,774, the lowest in Cyprus, reflecting the district’s continued appeal to local and foreign buyers seeking affordable yet attractive options.

Cyprus recorded one of the highest proportions of employees working long hours in the European Union during the second quarter of 2025, according to figures from Eurostat.

The figures reveal that 16.6 per cent of employed Cypriots aged 20 to 64 worked more than 45 hours per week in their main and second jobs combined.

This places Cyprus second only to Greece, which topped the list at 20.9 per cent, while Malta followed with 14.6 per cent.

At the other end of the scale, the lowest proportions of long-hour workers were found in Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, where the rates stood at 2.5 per cent, 4.1 per cent, and 5.9 per cent respectively.

Businesses are being urged to step up their role in the green transition while maintaining competitiveness, President Nikos Christodoulides told an event in Nicosia on Monday evening.

Addressing the presentation of the Photos Photiades Group’s new sustainability initiative ‘Epilogi’, he said the programme tackles one of today’s biggest challenges, protecting the environment in a “structured, practical and specific way.”

“Industry”, he said, “remains a key pillar of Cyprus’s economy but also one with significant energy needs.”

“However, through energy-efficient technologies, management systems and renewable energy, companies can reduce both their consumption and environmental footprint, our minimum obligation to future generations, while also strengthening their long-term competitiveness,” he added.

Christodoulides also said that the government is promoting investments in renewable energy, smart systems and innovative technologies aimed at cutting costs and improving industrial resilience.

Deputy Tourism Minister Kostas Koumis met with European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas this week, in order to discuss the European tourism strategy currently under development.

According to a statement by the Deputy Ministry, the meeting took place as part of the commissioner’s visit to Cyprus and focused on the sector’s importance to the Cypriot economy, as well as its performance from 2019 to the present.

The discussion acknowledged that tourism, in Cyprus as elsewhere, has been affected by both the pandemic and geopolitical tensions.

According to the announcement, the main topic of discussion was the European Tourism Strategy, an initiative of Commissioner Tzitzikostas, which is expected to be presented in 2026 following consultations with all stakeholders.

The process is set to culminate during the Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the EU.

Cyprus and Qatar have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to strengthen cooperation in maritime affairs.

The memorandum covers areas such as education, infrastructure, environmental protection, as well as the green transition of shipping.

The agreement was signed on Tuesday by Deputy Minister of Shipping Marina Hadjimanolis and Qatar’s Minister of Transport, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, on the sidelines of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol.

The signing followed a meeting between the two delegations, building on discussions held during Hadjimanolis’ official visit to Doha a few months earlier.

Hadjimanolis said she was pleased to welcome the Qatari minister to Cyprus, describing his presence as “a continuation of my visit to Doha, where we discussed the signing of this memorandum”.

Entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou awarded a total of €200,000 to three young Cypriot businesses during the 2025 Stelios Awards for Young Entrepreneurs, held at the Stelios Philanthropic Foundation headquarters in Nicosia.

The awards, now in their third consecutive year, aim to recognise innovation and support the growth of youth entrepreneurship in Cyprus.

The first prize of €100,000 was presented to George Chrysostomides for his Shopify website creation company, “Shrine”.

The second prize of €60,000 went to Chrystallena Poulli for her plant-based cosmetics company, “CP Herbalist”.

The third prize of €40,000 was awarded to Harout Chouldjian and Panayiotis Frantzesko for their international online shapewear clothing company, “Luxmery”.

The second day of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference, held on Tuesday, brought together international industry leaders for discussions on insurance, ownership, and chartering trends under the theme “Unlocking the Future of Shipping.”

Throughout the day, speakers and delegates examined how cooperation, technology, and long-term thinking will shape the sector’s evolution amid continued regulatory, geopolitical, and economic pressures.

The day began with the panel “P&I Market: Latest Developments and Update about the Renewal Season 2026,” moderated by Filippo Fabbri, CEO at Lockton P.L. Ferrari, and featuring Paul Jennings, Managing Director at NorthStandard, Andrew Taylor, CEO at UK P&I Club, Jonathan Andrews, CEO at Steamship Mutual, and Rolf Thore Roppestad, CEO at Gard AS.

During the discussion, speakers focused on the resilience of the protection and indemnity market and the challenges shaping the 2026 renewal season.

The Bank of Cyprus on Wednesday announced the full implementation of instant payments in Cyprus, effective October 9, 2025.

This will allow customers to send and receive payments from any bank within Cyprus or the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in a matter of seconds.

According to the bank’s announcement, customers will now be able to make and receive instant payments from any Cypriot or SEPA-zone bank, significantly reducing transaction times compared with traditional transfers.

The processing time for a payment from the payer’s account to the recipient’s account will be reduced to just 10 seconds, regardless of the country from which the payment originates.

By contrast, the current processing time for conventional bank transfers can take one to two business days.

The Cyprus hospitality venues association (Pasika) has expressed its strong opposition to a new draft law proposed by the Deputy Ministry of Tourism, warning that it will not hesitate to take strong measures if the bill is enacted.

The bill, titled “The Establishment and Operation of Catering and Entertainment Venues Law of 2025”, was approved by the Cabinet earlier this week.

According to the Deputy Ministry, the new legislation is designed to replace the existing framework governing the operation of recreation and entertainment centres, introducing simplified procedures, modernised regulations, and revised operating hours.

Deputy Minister of Tourism Kostas Koumis said that the law aims to modernise legislative provisions, support entrepreneurship, and promote service quality in the hospitality sector.

The European Union is ready to support the transformation of shipping into an industry focused on cleaner fuels, energy efficiency and innovation, European Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans Costas Kadis, said on Wednesday.

Kadis, who addressed the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference in Limassol, highlighted Cyprus’ important role in shaping the future of international shipping, both through the International Maritime Organisation and the EU, but also beyond these two bodies.

He added that this year’s conference theme, ‘Unlocking the Future of Shipping’, aligns closely with the pressing challenges currently facing the international maritime sector.

Saying that shipping is undergoing profound transformation, he stressed that “the European Union is ready to support this transition with both ambition and accountability”, and underlined that “the European Ocean Pact represents a flagship initiative of his portfolio”.

The Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference entered its third and final day on Wednesday, concluding three days of dynamic discussion under the central theme “Unlocking the Future of Shipping.”

Building on the momentum of previous sessions, the final day focused on the future of maritime safety, the transition toward climate resilience, and the technologies and partnerships that will shape the next decade of global shipping.

The day opened with an address by European Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans, Costas Kadis, who outlined the European Union’s commitment to supporting shipping’s green and digital transitions.

He highlighted Cyprus’ leadership as a maritime services hub and its close alignment with the EU’s vision for sustainable ocean governance under the European Ocean Pact.

According to the commissioner, a European Maritime Industrial Strategy, an EU Port Strategy and a Strategy for Coastal and Island Communities are all in the pipeline, each designed to strengthen competitiveness, modernise infrastructure and accelerate investment in renewable fuels and technology.

Cyprus’ Ministry of Labour will roll out or announce 14 employment support grant schemes by the end of 2025, with a combined budget of €88.7 million.

The schemes form part of the ministry’s broader employment strategy for 2026–2028, which focuses on tackling unemployment and helping businesses hire from groups facing barriers to work.

According to the ministry, the plans are co-financed by national resources, the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), and the Recovery and Resilience Plan, while the Department of Labour is responsible for their design, implementation and monitoring.

Within the framework of the Thaleia 2021–2027 Operational Programme, all 14 schemes are expected to be either completed or launched by the end of next year.

In September, the government moved ahead with four new incentive schemes aimed at helping those who face greater difficulties finding a job.

Cypriot MEP Michalis Hadjipantelas’ report on simplifying the EU tax was debated in the European Parliament plenary on Wednesday, aiming to make the bloc’s tax system more competitive without easing the fight against tax avoidance, evasion and fraud.

The report, according to Politis, includes proposals to reduce administrative barriers, simplify tax compliance, and cut compliance costs, which for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are estimated to reach about 30 per cent of taxes paid.

At the same time, the measures are expected to help governments improve tax collection and curb avoidance and evasion.

It also integrates key proposals from organised bodies in Cyprus, reinforcing the country’s presence and positions at the European level.

Hadjipantelas said in his address to the plenary that the EU “needs a simple tax framework, modern and functional, that will encourage entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises, attract investment and support social cohesion.”

Cyprus is pushing ahead with a new model of governance that puts people, trust and innovation at its core, Deputy Minister to the President Irene Piki said on Thursday, opening the Digital Agenda Cyprus Summit 2025 in Nicosia.

She said the government is modernising institutions, simplifying procedures and embedding accountability in daily decision-making, in an effort to make governance more efficient and ensure citizens feel that change is real.

“When people hear the phrase ‘digital transformation’, they often think of technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence,” she said, noting that, “for her, it is about people”.

She cited several examples, including “a citizen trying to renew a permit, a small business owner applying for a licence, or a parent enrolling their child in school online”.

These, she explained, are signs of a country that is “efficient, transparent, fair and results-oriented”.

Cypriot telecoms provider Cyta has won the top European award for its strategic fibre network rollout that brings high-speed internet to every corner of Cyprus.

The telecommunications authority received first place in the category “Champions in addressing the digital divide in rural and remote areas” at the European Digital Connectivity Awards 2025, held in Brussels on October 7, 2025.

“The award recognised Cyta’s nationwide fibre-optic network development, a strategic project that only Cyta is implementing on an island-wide scale to ensure equal access for all citizens to Gigabit speeds, from urban centres to the most remote communities,” the company said in an announcement.

“Through this project, local communities are being empowered, businesses strengthened, and access facilitated to essential services such as remote education, teleworking and telemedicine,” it added.

Eurobank reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Cyprus’ new generation of entrepreneurs, standing once again beside the country’s emerging business leaders at the eighth annual “Ge’ neo Epicheirein” Young Entrepreneurship Awards 2025, held on October 8, 2025, at the Presidential Palace.

The awards, organised by the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Keve) and Greek magazine Thessalonikis Dromena, were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry, with the support of Eurobank Ltd, the Youth Board of Cyprus, Coneq, and the Association of Cypriot Cartoonists.

The long-established awards aim to recognise and reward young entrepreneurs under 40 years old, highlighting their essential role in driving innovation, extroversion, and economic growth in Cyprus.

Eurobank’s General Manager of Corporate Banking, Nicolas Panayi, congratulated the winners and organisers, describing the event as a celebration of courage, creativity, and innovation.

Seventy-four per cent of shipping companies have already aligned or plan to align with the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) net-zero emissions targets, according to preliminary findings presented at the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference.

Biofuels have emerged as the dominant choice for decarbonisation, with 62 per cent of companies adopting them as part of their transition strategy.

Meanwhile, interest in green hydrogen and ammonia is also growing, with 25 per cent and 19 per cent of respondents respectively identifying them as future alternative fuels.

The findings were presented by Michalis Ierides, secretary-general of the Cyprus Marine Environment Protection Association (CYMEPA), as part of the ongoing international five-year project Metavasea.

The Association of Cyprus Banks (ACB) on Thursday announced that Panicos Nicolaou, chief executive officer at the Bank of Cyprus, has been appointed as its new president following the most recent meeting of board of directors.

Demetris Shacallis, chief financial officer at Eurobank, has been appointed vice-president.

According to the association’s statutes, both the president and vice-president will serve a two-year term.

The change in leadership follows the departure of former president Aristidis Bourakis, who stepped down after taking on new professional responsibilities.

In its statement, the Association of Cyprus Banks thanked Bourakis for his contribution and wished him “every success in his future endeavours”.

A new survey by Zubr Capital has revealed that the majority of relocated tech founders in Europe feel shut out of local startup ecosystems, describing them as “in a bubble” and often lacking meaningful access to capital and quality support.

The findings, published in September 2025, stem from the Relocated Tech Survey, which collected insights from over 100 participants, primarily startup founders, along with investors and senior executives.

Respondents were drawn from major relocation hubs across Europe, with Poland and Cyprus among the most represented, offering what Zubr Capital described as a rare dual founder–investor perspective on how well Europe integrates incoming entrepreneurial talent.

According to the survey, 82 per cent of relocated founders said that local ecosystems are “in a bubble”, while 51 per cent considered this situation critical.

The Cyprus Association of Large Investment Projects has backed a bill to establish a national mechanism for the control of foreign direct investments (FDI), saying it will bolster the credibility of the state and the economy without deterring foreign investors.

Covering key sectors such as energy, financial services and defence, the bill aligns with Cyprus’ wider strategy to attract international capital for major projects that support long-term growth.

The association said that “the need for a formal control framework emerged after a series of large-scale acquisitions in public utilities, which revealed the risk of strategic infrastructure being transferred to investors from third countries”.

“Given the small size of the Cypriot economy, such developments could affect critical sectors such as banking and port operations,” the association added.

A bill submitted to parliament by the Deputy Ministry of Tourism seeks to modernise the legal framework governing catering and entertainment venues, aiming to boost competitiveness and simplify outdated procedures in Cyprus’ hospitality sector.

According to the ministry’s introductory report, the proposed law addresses long-standing gaps and weaknesses in the existing system, with a view to strengthening entrepreneurship, public safety and the overall quality of the tourism product.

It abolishes what the ministry described as “burdensome and anachronistic provisions” that hinder business development, replacing them with a more flexible and transparent structure.

Under the new framework, seven key changes are proposed. These include scrapping strict building criteria and the previous categorisation of recreation centres by class, as well as ending the requirement for operators to submit price lists for approval.

More than 1,000 delegates took part in the international Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, held in Limassol from October 6 to October 8.

The conference focused on how to unlock the future of shipping, exploring topics such as navigating global disruptions, the P&I market, decarbonisation and climate resilience, technological impacts on seafarers, and funding strategies for the next era of shipping.

Moreover, this year’s event, supported by Eurobank as a platinum sponsor, provided a vital platform for dialogue on the challenges, risks, and opportunities shaping the new era of global shipping.

“Established in 1989, the conference once again highlighted Cyprus’ role as an international maritime, energy, and investment centre, hosting senior executives, officials, and leaders from across the global shipping industry,” Eurobank said in a statement released on Friday.

Neocleous Tower is a groundbreaking commercial development in central Limassol inviting corporations to discover the future of upscale workplace excellence. Redefining the work lifestyle paradigm, the tower is also raising the benchmark for sustainable real estate, offering an eco-conscious, tech-driven and people-centric work environment that fosters excellence, collaboration and well-being.

One of the central themes of the recently-concluded Cyprus–Greece Business and Investment Forum was that the two countries should pursue stronger collaborations, partnerships, and joint ventures to bolster their economies and expand into neighbouring markets.

The event, which took place in Athens, attracted broad participation from both countries’ business communities.

“The event underscored the need for closer cooperation in sectors such as investment, technology, innovation, and women’s entrepreneurship, highlighting their potential to drive mutual economic growth,” the organisers said in a statemenet released on Friday.

Speaking at the forum, Cyprus’ Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry, George Papanastasiou, and Greece’s Deputy Minister of Development, Stavros Kalafatis, emphasised that “businesses in both countries have the capacity, infrastructure, and willingness to enhance their cooperation and strengthen economic prospects”.

The Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC) expressed its strong support for a joint statement by seven leading international maritime organisations urging governments to adopt the ‘Net-Zero Framework’ (NZF).

The proposal is set to be discussed at next week’s Extraordinary Session of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which will take place from October 14 to 17, 2025.

The statement, endorsed by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA), the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) and the World Shipping Council (WSC), calls for the NZF to be adopted as a single, global framework to drive the industry’s transition to zero emissions.

The National Hurricane Center has its odds of development in the low range for now.","Updated 10 a.m. ET Saturday

The storm will strengthen as it tracks offshore of the Carolinas later today. Winds will increase along the coast, especially around the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The most significant impacts of the system look to begin tomorrow in the Northeast, however. Strong winds from the east and northeast will impact the coast from the Delmarva Peninsula, along the Jersey Shore, Long Island, and into coastal New England.

Winds will blow hard Sunday into Monday, at least. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph are forecast at the coast and up to 30 mph inland. Tides at the beaches and in bays, waterways, and sounds will run a few feet above normal with powerful waves crashing onto beaches, causing high water and beach erosion along most of the eastern seaboard.

The National Weather Service has issued a variety of coastal flood alerts from Florida to New England. If you're near the water, beware of the threat to your neighborhood. And remember, the flooding will be saltwater, which is terrible for your car if you drive through it.

Travel may be disrupted Sunday and Monday in the tri-state area around New York City and in Boston. Check with your airline before you go.

A swath of heavy rain is forecast along the coast, especially from Cape Hatteras north to New England. The land is quite dry, however, which will limit flooding. But in many areas, drainage runs into waterways that might be elevated by the extra-high tides, so local freshwater flooding is possible.

Stay alert to changing conditions along the coast and west to the I-95 corridor until the storm moves away on Tuesday.

Jerry is still disorganized, and the National Hurricane Center is not expecting it to pull itself together to become a hurricane before it gets absorbed into a cold front in a few days. The storm's moisture tail is still impacting the northeast Caribbean with periods of very heavy rain. That will slowly let up as Jerry swings into the central Atlantic, bypassing Bermuda.

An unusually robust tropical disturbance for this time of year has moved off Africa. The National Hurricane Center has its odds of development in the low range for now. In any case, it's forecast to turn north into the open Atlantic.

Interestingly, some computer forecasts show yet another African disturbance moving into the Atlantic next week. We'll watch for that.

""In the unlikely event of any glint and glare occurring, it would be at such a small scale to not be different from what is experienced in the presence of the sun daily and hence would go unnoticed so as to not affect the amenity of their living,"" the statement said.

A decision is expected later this year after a consultation.

Taking Action To Defend America From UN's First Global Carbon Tax - International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF)

Joint Statement by Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Duffy

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.

The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.

The US government, however, slammed the proposal, calling it “a global carbon tax that would harm economic growth and penalize developing nations.”

Since retaking office in January, President Donald Trump has rolled back several climate initiatives, dismissing climate change as a “hoax” and promoting fossil fuel expansion through deregulation.

Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reiterated that the Trump administration “categorically rejects” the NZF proposal and will resist any attempt to impose what it considers “globalist economic controls” through the UN framework.

This recognition marks a significant step towards creating an integrated hydrogen ecosystem and advancing India’s transition towards clean energy.

The National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched by the Government of India, aims to position the country as a global hub for the production, utilisation, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. The Mission promotes the development of large-scale hydrogen hubs to serve as focal points for production and consumption, thereby facilitating the establishment of a sustainable and competitive hydrogen economy.

Welcoming the development, the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW), Sarbananda Sonowal said, “This recognition marks a defining moment in India’s maritime journey as we transition to become a modern, capable and leader in the global maritime segment. Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, we are working towards building an ecosystem of sustainable development that will power India towards realising the vision of becoming net zero by 2070. Ports are an important node in this transition. As Green Hydrogen hubs, our ports will act as catalysts of clean energy innovation. As a maritime leader, India’s ports will not only empower their own country but also leverage its strategic positions along the eastern and western trade routes to drive the region towards sustainable logistics.”

Recognising the logistical and technical challenges associated with long-distance hydrogen transport, the Mission adopts a cluster-based development model. This approach enhances early-stage project viability, enables infrastructure convergence, and helps achieve economies of scale in identified regions.

The revised scheme guidelines for setting up Hydrogen Valley Innovation Clusters (HVIC) and Green Hydrogen Hubs, issued on 27th June 2025, provide the framework for identifying and supporting potential regions capable of large-scale hydrogen activity. Under Component B2 of these guidelines, MNRE may recognise locations as Green Hydrogen Hubs without direct financial assistance, thereby facilitating access to incentives and benefits available under other central or state government schemes.

In accordance with these provisions, the competent authority has approved the recognition of Deendayal, V.O. Chidambaranar, and Paradip Port areas as Green Hydrogen Hubs. Projects established within these designated zones will be eligible for benefits available under other relevant schemes and policies of the Central and State Governments, including those linked to the National Green Hydrogen Mission.

The recognition of these ports is expected to catalyse industrial participation, attract green investments, and promote innovation in clean fuel technologies, supporting India’s broader vision of achieving energy self-reliance and net-zero emissions by 2070.

This recognition has been issued with the approval of the competent authority.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/H-2-hubs-three-news.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:57:21.476835

The United States has threatened to use visa restrictions and sanctions to hit back against nations that vote in favor of a plan put forward by an UN agency to reduce global-warming greenhouse gas emissions from sea shipping.

United Nations (UN) members are scheduled to vote next week on the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework proposal to reduce global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector, which handles around 80% of world trade and accounts for close to 3% of global greenhouse gases.

Large container carriers, under pressure from investors to fight climate change, generally agree that a global regulatory framework is crucial to speeding up decarbonisation. Still, some of the world’s biggest oil tanker companies said they had ‘grave concerns’ about the proposal.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a joint statement.

“The proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties,” they said.

Without global regulation, the maritime industry would face a patchwork of regulations and increasing costs without effectively curbing climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, supporters of the IMO proposal have said.

The US is considering retaliation against UN countries that support the plan, the US officials said in Friday's statement.

That includes potentially blocking vessels flagged in those nations from US ports, imposing visa restrictions and fees, and slapping sanctions on officials “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies”.

The US is now considering the following measures against countries backing the deal, according to the statement:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

However, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, have denounced the framework. In a joint statement, they described it as an “unsanctioned global tax regime” that could raise shipping and energy costs, harming both the American economy and international trade. The officials warned that any country endorsing the plan could face penalties such as blocked port access for vessels, higher fees, and targeted sanctions against policymakers “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

While environmental advocates and major shipping companies argue that unified global standards are essential to accelerate decarbonization and prevent fragmented regulations, some oil tanker operators have voiced “grave concerns” over potential financial burdens.

In the wake of the storm, unusual clouds were spotted from parts of Scotland.

BBC Weather Watchers captured some of the scenes on Monday.

Striking asperitas formations were among the clouds spotted.

The Met Office describes them as a new and rare cloud type that look like ""rippling ocean waves in the sky"".

It also said why these clouds form remains a mystery, but it is thought their appearance is associated with thunderstorms.

The Met Office added: ""What is clear, however, is that atmospheric conditions must be unstable to form a wavy cloud base like that seen with asperitas.""

BBC Weather Watcher Martainn pictured asperitas from Arnisdale, in the west Highlands, on Monday evening.

Similar formations were seen from Lochcarron, also in the Highlands.

In parts of north east Scotland, there were double rainbows and some dramatic sunsets.

Since returning to power in January, US President Donald Trump has reversed Washington's course on climate change, denouncing it as a ""scam"" and encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation.

In the statement, Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Trump administration ""unequivocally rejects"" the NZF proposal.

They threatened a range of punishing actions against countries that vote in favor of the framework, including: visa restrictions; blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports; imposing commercial penalties; and considering sanctions on officials.

As the final stretch of the 2025 Atlantic season is underway, no hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S., though four have formed so far.
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.

Karen formed late the night of Oct. 9 and by morning was located about 570 miles north-northwest of the Azores off of Portugal. As of Oct. 10, there were no threats to land predicted from Karen, which was moving 9 mph to the northeast with wind speeds of 40 mph.

The subtropical storm won't make it far before fizzling out into a post-tropical low by Oct. 11, the National Hurricane Center said. It will pick up a little in speed but not strength in the meantime, forecasters said.

Tropical Storm Jerry is meanwhile bringing heavy rain to the Caribbean island of Barbuda, along with the Leeward and Virgin islands, risking flash flooding, the hurricane center said. Puerto Rico could also see between 2 and 4 inches with localized amounts up to 6 inches.

Jerry was struggling to organize into a hurricane as forecasters previously predicted might happen toward the end of the week. Early on Oct. 10 it was passing to the north of the Leeward Islands and was located about 80 miles away, with wind speeds up to 50 mph.

As the final stretch of the 2025 Atlantic season is underway, no hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S., though four have formed so far. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November. Experts say it's wise to stay prepared for potential impacts, as more hurricanes or strong storms could still form before then.

A grim reminder: October is still hurricane season. These were the most destructive October storms in U.S. history

Tropical Storm Jerry not expected to become a hurricane

Jerry is no longer expected to become a hurricane, which would happen if it reached wind speeds of at least 74 mph. Jerry could still see some strengthening, but some forecast models suggest it won't strengthen further at all and there's some indication it will only weaken, forecasters said.

Despite not forming into a hurricane, Jerry is still bringing potentially dangerous rainfall and flash flooding risk to the Leeward and Virgin islands. Dangerous surf conditions are also extending out from the tropical storm.

Jerry is moving toward the northwest and is expected to make a northward turn later on Oct. 10, pulling away from the islands. Its center should move well to the southeast of Bermuda on Oct. 12. By early next week, Jerry is likely to turn more northeastward and eastward, forecasters said.

US faces dual storm threats this weekend

On the Atlantic Coast, a developing nor'easter on the horizon for the weekend is forecast to wreak havoc on a stretch from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic, likely reaching the Northeast. Coastal flooding and high surf, compounded by seasonal high tides, with dangerous rip currents and gusty winds are all possible from the storm, the National Weather Service said.

Tropical moisture from Hurricane Priscilla in the Pacific is meanwhile expected to bring heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding in the Southwest. Burn scars are particularly vulnerable to flooding in the region, forecasters said.

They firmly stated that the administration will not support any policy that adds to the financial burden of energy providers, shipping companies, or consumers.

Supporters of the IMO's initiative argue that without a comprehensive global regulation, the industry will deal with a fragmented regulatory landscape that increases costs while failing to curb emissions effectively.

It’s cheaper than distillate fuels and is used widely by most of the large cruise ships that travel along Alaska’s coastline every year.
Nearly 80% of the cruise trips made in Alaska last year burned heavy fuel oil through open-loop or hybrid systems.
Cruise ships that burn heavy fuel oil are equipped to switch between fuel types.","Some Alaskans are fired up about water pollution from heavy fuel oil burned on large cruise ships. At a panel discussion in Juneau on Wednesday, members of tribes and conservation organizations said there’s a solution: using cleaner fuel.

Heavy fuel oil is the stuff from the bottom of the barrel — the waste product at the end of the oil refining process. It’s cheaper than distillate fuels and is used widely by most of the large cruise ships that travel along Alaska’s coastline every year.

When it’s burned, heavy fuel oil exhaust releases sulfur oxide into the air, which can cause heart and lung disease and lead to acid rain. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, required ships that burn heavy fuel oil to use scrubbers, which filter the exhaust through seawater.

Aaron Brakel is a clean water campaigner at the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, which organized the panel. He said scrubbers didn’t solve the pollution problem — they just moved it into the ocean.

“They spray the water, transferring pollutants from the air into the water from the exhaust,” he said. “Most of the scrubbers worldwide, most of the ones here in Alaska, are open-loop systems.”

That means they pump seawater infused with toxic exhaust back into the ocean instead of storing it and disposing of it at an onshore facility.

Nearly 80% of the cruise trips made in Alaska last year burned heavy fuel oil through open-loop or hybrid systems. Hybrid scrubbers can switch between dumping the effluent or storing it, depending on discharge regulations in the waters the ship is passing through.

Brakel probed into U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records and found that between 2023 and 2024, 17 ships using open-loop scrubber systems reported more than 700 water quality violations off the coast of Alaska, as Alaska Public Media reported last month. But the data doesn’t show exactly where the violations happened.

Kay Brown is the Arctic policy director at Pacific Environment, an advocacy nonprofit. Last year, she and her colleagues published a literature review of studies around the world on the negative effects of scrubbers.

“The big takeaway here is that scrubber pollution is toxic to marine life at very low concentrations,” Brown said.

One study found scrubber wastewater at a concentration of 5% killed tiny crustaceans called copepods within one day, and called the wastewater a “witch’s cauldron” of toxic compounds. Another study found that exposure to scrubber discharge affected the reproduction success of some mussel and sea urchin species at even lower concentrations.

Several Southeast tribes have passed resolutions calling for cleaner fuel, including the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, the Organized Village of Kake, the Organized Village of Kasaan and the Ketchikan Indian Community.

Ilsxilee Stáng Gloria Burns is president of the Ketchikan Indian Community. She said she wants cruise lines to take initiative.

“This practice of fuel dumping makes the cruise ships an extractive industry,” she said.

Burns said the onus is on the cruise industry to build a relationship of reciprocity instead.

Linda Behnken is the executive director of the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association and board president of Alaska’s Sustainable Fisheries Trust. She’s fished commercially for 40 years and says the statewide seafood marketing strategy is built on telling the story of Alaska’s healthy, pristine waters.

“To have this information, to me, where we know sort of that dirty secret, I feel like we’re being disingenuous by continuing to build our reputation on this,” she said.

Behnken said Alaskans have a responsibility to protect the water from pollution.

Cruise ships that burn heavy fuel oil are equipped to switch between fuel types.

Some regulations have already taken effect in U.S. waters. Last year, the IMO banned heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, with some fuel tank exceptions. Scrubber discharge is restricted in Hawaii’s waters and banned within the Port of Seattle. California has long required ships to burn cleaner fuels upon entering its waters.

Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, attended the panel. He said he’s concerned about water pollution from scrubbers, but hasn’t decided on a policy path yet.

He said he’s been meeting with a lot of people about it, including cruise companies.

“We had some serious conversations and they presented some research, some of which I bought and some which I didn’t,” Kiehl said.

Cruise Lines International Association Alaska represents the cruise industry.

“There is no scientific basis to support a ban on [scrubbers],” CLIAA spokesperson Lanie Downs wrote in an email, adding that they “remain an important compliance option as the maritime sector continues to reduce air emissions.”

Alix Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry director, said in an interview that there’s a long-standing voluntary commitment from the cruise lines to switch to marine gas oil when they’re in Gastineau Channel, while in Juneau’s cruise port and upon departure.

“All we can do is make agreements and ask that they be followed, and even if we did have legislation, I don’t know what our compliance program would look like,” Pierce said.

She said the city has no reason to believe ships aren’t honoring the commitment. But in 2019, Gov. Mike Dunleavy axed state funding for the Ocean Rangers program that had observers aboard cruise ships, so there is no longer oversight on oil slicks. The state’s wastewater permits and ship inspectors only address sewage and grey water, not scrubber wastewater dumping.

Pierce said the city is working to help find alternative shipping fuels through a partnership between ports and cruise lines called the Pacific Northwest to Alaska green corridor project.

“We’re excited to see how we can kind of continue to try to drive change in the alternative fuel space, because that’s really the future,” she said.

She said the group will publish a report in the next few months looking at the feasibility of transitioning cruise ships to another fuel type called green methanol, which can be produced from municipal or agricultural waste. The IMO suggests it could cut carbon and sulfur oxide emissions. Pierce said the effort could move the needle beyond the scrubber problem and meet IMO’s goal to make shipping a net-zero emissions industry by 2050.

Juneau’s last cruise ship of the 2025 season will depart next Tuesday.

This marks the fourth annual disclosure and the second year of benchmarking results against the IMO’s 2023 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy, which targets net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050.

Rising Misalignment Despite Operational Improvements

According to the report, climate alignment scores for 2024 show an average misalignment of 27.4% with the minimum trajectory and 35.1% with the striving trajectory, both higher than in 2023 (24.8% and 30.8%, respectively).

Despite this setback, the report notes positive progress at the vessel level, particularly in operational efficiency and emissions intensity reduction. However, external challenges such as global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions causing longer voyage routes contributed to higher emissions and overall misalignment.

The 2024 data also indicates a narrower range of climate alignment scores, suggesting greater consistency among signatories. This uniformity is largely due to improved data modeling and collection processes, allowing insurers to better understand and address emissions trends in their portfolios.

Commitment Toward a Sustainable Maritime Future

While the report underscores the gap between current performance and IMO targets, it also highlights a shared commitment to change. Signatories are strengthening their approach by integrating responsible underwriting, educating clients on decarbonization strategies, and collaborating strategically to promote sustainability.

Additionally, insurers are exploring ways to increase coverage for green vessels, adopt efficiency-based underwriting, and leverage sustainability as a competitive advantage. These steps signal a growing recognition that environmental performance is becoming central to long-term business resilience in the maritime sector.

The 2024 PPMI report paints a mixed picture: while progress in efficiency and awareness is evident, the overall alignment with IMO decarbonization goals has weakened. The findings emphasize the urgent need for collective innovation, regulatory support, and industry-wide cooperation to steer global shipping back on course toward net-zero emissions. With continued dedication and collaboration, the maritime insurance sector can play a pivotal role in driving sustainable transformation across the global shipping industry.

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.

The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.

“Both LNG and bio-LNG can help reduce lifecycle GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions compared with conventional marine fuels,” Exxon global lower emission fuel manager Amy Wood said.
Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.","US supermajor Exxon Mobil has made a small splash into the LNG bunkering space with plans to charter two new vessels, as part of a larger plan to invest billions in low-carbon opportunities over the next five years.

While Exxon plans to start offering bunkering services in 2027, it is also “actively developing complementary supply solutions” to support customers who are ready to adopt LNG before that time, the company said in a statement, stopping short of providing details.

It is not clear where the two vessels, chartered respectively from Avenir LNG and Evalend Shipping in the first and fourth quarter of 2027, will be deployed. The ships will be capable of transporting both LNG and biogas-derived bio-LNG.

New Addition

LNG bunkering appears to be a new addition to the $30 billion in “low-carbon opportunities” identified by Exxon during its corporate plan update in December last year — some of which have been facing headwinds. It included low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, lithium, carbon materials and its patented Proxxima high-performance polymer.

The foray into bunkering marks a key step in supporting the maritime industry’s decarbonization efforts.

“Both LNG and bio-LNG can help reduce lifecycle GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions compared with conventional marine fuels,” Exxon global lower emission fuel manager Amy Wood said.

“As the maritime industry looks for scalable solutions to reduce GHG emissions, Exxon Mobil is leveraging its skills and capabilities to deliver these fuel options,” Wood said.

Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.

Ships, which move close to 90% of global goods, still run overwhelmingly on oil products, but mounting climate pressure, technological breakthroughs and shifting capital are converging to reshape the industry’s fuel choices toward low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory Push

Exxon’s foray into LNG bunkering comes as “supportive policies and rising demand for LNG in marine transportation are creating opportunities,” the company said, emphasizing that technology-neutral policies are essential to accelerate the adoption of lower GHG emission marine fuels.

The US major did not specify which policies it was referring to, but International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states are due to decide at a London meeting on Oct. 14-17 whether to approve the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) designed to put shipping on a trajectory to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The NZF consists of a global fuel standard, a GHG pricing mechanism with credit trading and a revenue-recycling scheme that would use the revenues from the pricing regime to fund green fuel initiatives.

The outcome of the vote is hard to predict. At the last IMO meeting, there was heavy opposition from a handful of flag states and oil exporters, and overt pressure from the Trump administration has also complicated the politics. But the NZF requires a majority of member states, rather than full consensus, to pass.

The shipping industry emits more than 1 billion tons of CO2 annually, accounting for approximately 3% of global human-caused emissions, according to Japanese shipping firm NYK Line.

Transition Fuel

LNG-ready ships account for around 7% of the global fleet by tonnage, the largest share among alternative fuel pathways, supported by existing bunkering infrastructure and local air quality benefits over fuel oil.

Some research suggests the NZF will favor the deployment of ammonia in the medium term, while others estimate it could support first-generation biofuels or even LNG in the short term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last month in its Global Hydrogen Review.

“A lot will hinge on the guidelines to be developed in the next few months, and in particular on the default emission factors included in the guidelines on life-cycle GHG intensity of marine fuels,” the IEA said.

LNG is viable as an NZF compliance option over the next five to 10 years, experts and shippers say, but it isn’t generally considered a scalable zero-emission fuel because it still emits CO2 and methane.

Some observers argue that with container vessels typically built for 20–25 year lifespans, LNG newbuilds could face stranded asset risk by the mid-2030s as IMO rules tighten and increasingly favor hydrogen-derived fuels.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768c284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5476x2875+0+447/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2Ffe%2F67a481e54f2b9f1b901530266064%2Fss498488416-logos-companies-exxon.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:56:22.294452

Corvus Energy operates across 15 locations internationally, with manufacturing sites in Norway, Canada and the United States. The company claims to have supplied more than half of the world’s zero-emissions vessels, which are few in number, and said it has delivered more than 1,300 hybrid or all-electric ESS installations worldwide.

""This represents 1,300 MWh of installed capacity and more than 1M operating hours across different segments such as ferries, offshore vessels, tugs, ropaxes and cruise ships – averting an estimated 11M tonnes of CO2 to date,"" the company said.

The need to avoid further use of the fossil fuel, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is ’urgent’, according to MARBEM.

""Methane, a greenhouse gas 82 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, is the primary component in LNG. Methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships rose 180% between 2016 and 2023, underscoring the urgent need for informed action,"" the group said.

According to MARBEM, there were an estimated 247,000 tonnes of methane emissions in 2023 from shipping’s global LNG-fuelled fleet. These emissions, they claim, translated to nearly US$950M in annual climate damages – a near-fourfold increase from 2016, when the estimates stood at around US$250M.

The figures incorporate damages and deaths from the effects of ground-level ozone, a critical pollutant formed by methane, and, while significant, the group said it does not fully represent the impact of the pollution.

""This figure still understates total harm by excluding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, localised air quality, and non-fatal health outcomes such as asthma and hospitalisations,"" MARBEM said.

In its research, MARBEM said it used the US EPA’s Social Cost of Methane, a monetary benchmark of the human and environmental impacts of methane-based pollution that the group said is consistent with internationally recognised values.

The group said it aims to provide independent, evidence-based data ""that enables and encourages the sector to make tangible commitments towards future-ready shipping solutions"".

The newly formed initiative said it is working with policy experts, financial analysts, economists and research institutions to target the uptake of fuels in the maritime sector that are lower in greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous pollutants than methane-based LNG.

With partners in 13 countries focused on the LNG supply chain, including fossil, bio and e-LNG, MARBEM said it aims to ""clarify regulations, technologies, and analyse the trends influencing maritime decarbonisation"".

""LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG dual-fuel vessels accounting for 55% of the current orderbook. If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10% of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030. At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bioLNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emissions future,"" the group said.

With major decisions coming up at shipping’s United Nations-based regulator the International Maritime Organization and within the European Union on the substance of plans for the shipping sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions around 2050, MARBEM said it would be working directly to influence regulators.

""In the months ahead, Maritime Beyond Methane will actively engage with IMO, and with EU regulators through the FuelEU negotiations, to inform decisions in line with global climate ambition, supporting the advancement of regulatory frameworks that use informed decision-making that keeps the shipping sector on track towards a just, net-zero emissions future,"" MARBEM said.

""The shipping sector is nearing a critical juncture to be able to move the dial on getting off LNG, and avoiding any alternative that enables locking-in methane and going farther down a pathway where monetary penalties, costly retrofits and early abandonment of vessels will get more severe with the continued use of methane-based fuels that have no real impact on decarbonising shipping and addressing the climate crisis.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/151/Gate-Terminal_at_Rotterdam_source_Gate_Terminal_1200w_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 16:56:56.192500

Ensuring that Africa benefits from the new mechanism would showcase international cooperation success.","African governments are now key players in shipping emissions negotiations. Earlier this year, they helped approve the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This framework includes the first binding pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The IMO is expected to formally adopt this measure in October. This represents a significant win for climate action and reduces shipping's reliance on fossil fuels.

The real challenge lies in designing and implementing this policy over the next few years. African governments are particularly concerned about how to use revenues from the pricing mechanism. These revenues could reach $10-15 billion per year by 2030. If used wisely, these funds could help close Africa's energy gap and improve port infrastructure.

Investments could also enhance transmission networks and unlock renewable energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar power. A strong grid is vital for producing renewable hydrogen and green e-fuels. These solutions are promising for the shipping industry’s long-term sustainability.

Africa has struggled to develop its renewable resources due to high capital costs. Many African economies face unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings. This situation makes clean energy investments very expensive. Currently, Africa receives only about 2% of global renewable investment.

The new carbon-pricing mechanism could lower initial costs and encourage clean-energy investments. The IMO must create incentives for e-fuels to support Africa's renewable resources effectively. Without these incentives, cheaper options like liquefied natural gas may undermine green hydrogen efforts.

Using biofuels could be disastrous for African nations like Nigeria. Diverting crops for fuel while millions face hunger is both immoral and reckless. Biofuel production can worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.

Nigeria has abundant resources to lead in sustainable shipping fuels but needs proper investments now. If designed well, the IMO’s framework could provide essential funding for Africa’s renewable capacity growth. Failing to create an ambitious policy risks limiting Africa's future prospects.

As the IMO meets in London this month, African countries should demonstrate leadership like at the Second Africa Climate Summit. Ensuring that Africa benefits from the new mechanism would showcase international cooperation success. A climate-resilient future is possible if African voices are heard on the global stage.

Waiting until 2029 for support is unconscionable. The proposal accelerates the Fund’s establishment and calls for readiness finance to flow by 2026. Delaying until 2029 risks billions in lost support — billions that should already be building resilience and a just transition.

On governance of the Fund:

Justice must be written into its design. An equal split on the Board is proposed: seven seats each for SIDS and LDCs; developing countries; and developed countries. That is how equity becomes real.

On zero- and near-zero fuels:

Only scalable, truly clean solutions should qualify. Scarce resources must not be wasted on false options that buy more years for fossil fuels. Fuels that compromise the environmental integrity of the Net-Zero Framework, slow the energy transition, and endanger food security must be avoided.

On climate science:

The evidence is clear. 2024 was the first year the planet stayed above 1.5 °C for twelve consecutive months. The IPCC made it clear in 2018 that 1.5 °C is a dangerous threshold — not just for Pacific Islands, but for the planet as a whole. In Tuvalu, the impact is already felt: the land is disappearing underfoot.

While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific Island nations must consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake.

We are here to lead high ambition, as we always have. Our abstention at MEPC 83 was a signal: Tuvalu will not rubber-stamp weak outcomes. At this Extraordinary Session, we call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival.

The move—decades in the making—marks a turning point for one of the world’s most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

A Price on Pollution

At the core of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is a simple but powerful idea: if you emit, you pay. From 2027, ships over 5,000 gross tons—responsible for about 85% of the industry’s CO₂ emissions—will be subject to mandatory emissions limits and a global fuel pricing system. Those that outperform the thresholds earn rewards; those that exceed them must buy “remedial units” or contribute to the IMO’s new Net-Zero Fund.

The system is expected to raise $11–12 billion annually by 2030, funding cleaner fuel innovation, seafarer training, and technology transfer to developing nations. In other words, the polluters help pay for the transition.

One Global Standard, Not Many

For years, industry leaders warned of the risks of a fragmented patchwork of regional carbon rules—from the EU’s ETS to national carbon levies. “A unified global system is essential,” said one member of the Getting to Zero Coalition, “otherwise shipowners face conflicting regulations and distorted competition.”

That call seems to have been heard. The new framework, backed by the EU27, BRICS, and major flag states, reflects a rare global alignment. Shipowner groups and maritime associations have lined up in support, urging IMO member states to finalize the deal during the MEPC E.2 session (October 14–17).

The Politics of Progress

Still, the consensus isn’t universal. The United States has reportedly expressed “serious reservations,” with some sources suggesting Washington is seeking to delay adoption until after further domestic review. But with mounting pressure from both industry and environmental groups, few expect that to stall the process.

As one European delegate put it this week: “If not now, when? The industry is ready. Investors are ready. The world is watching.”

Rewarding Early Movers

Unlike traditional carbon taxes, the IMO’s approach combines penalties with incentives. Ships that switch early to low- or zero-emission fuels—like green methanol or ammonia—stand to earn credits that can be traded or sold. That reward mechanism, observers say, could accelerate fuel adoption faster than regulation alone ever could.

“Every ton of CO₂ avoided becomes an asset,” said a technical advisor at Global Maritime Forum. “That changes the economics entirely.”

What Happens Next

Once adopted, technical negotiations will continue into 2026 to refine operational details and verification systems. For shipowners, the clock will be ticking fast toward 2027 compliance. Ports and fuel suppliers, too, will need to adapt—because once a carbon price is set, there’s no going back to free emissions.",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-apple-touch-icon-32x32-optimized.png,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:20.907408

With the longest coastline in the world, an exclusive economic zone of nearly six million km², and the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system linking the Atlantic Ocean to North America’s industrial heartland, Canada’s prosperity has always been tied to the sea. It is only natural to build upon that strength.

The Government of Canada’s Projects of National Interest list appropriately highlights the significance of ports and marine infrastructure for Canada’s economy and trade. Key projects include expanding the Port of Montreal, significant offshore wind development in Nova Scotia, and enhancing northern ports for increased shipping through the Northwest Passage.

But this moment is also about more than building port capacity and doubling down on fossil fuel exports. The next round of nation-building announcements, expected imminently, will provide a critical opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate that it understands the increasingly significant link between clean electricity and economic power.

Ports are critical in the supply chain—connecting offshore wind to the grid, linking shipping to industry, and tying together rail and road networks. Modern, electrified ports can maximize generational investments in clean energy by serving as hubs for offshore wind, energy storage, sustainable fuel trade, and electrified transport.

Geopolitical heavyweights already understand this. China and India are moving at breakneck speed to electrify their ports to support cleaner economic growth and trade. If Canada is serious about competing with global players, it must be able to meet the world where it is going. With abundant wind and solar resources, Canada has a natural advantage in the clean energy transition. Not harnessing it risks falling behind—and facing penalties for the goods we export.

The international shipping sector is moving rapidly to impose penalties for dirty shipping, and reward early adopters of zero- or near-zero-emission shipping fuels such as those derived from green hydrogen. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is targeting steep reductions in the carbon intensity of international shipping, with a goal of being net-zero by 2050. Measures including cleaner standards and a global emissions pricing mechanism are being finalized and are expected to be in force in just two years. The Global Maritime Forum estimates the demand for hydrogen-derived shipping fuel, such as e-methanol and e-ammonia, will be over 500 million tonnes by 2040 due to these regulations, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity and hundreds of thousands of green jobs.

Canadian ports and shipping companies need help with supply and access to zero-emission fuels and renewable energy. Without it, Canada’s world class ports of today, Port of Vancouver, Port of Montreal, and Port of Halifax risk being a destination for the world’s most polluting ships.

The government has an opportunity to leverage its historic investments in nation-building projects and port infrastructure to unlock market opportunities for Canadian hydrogen producers and renewable energy developers. To remain competitive with the EU and China, Canada must grow trade without also growing emissions.

Canadians are counting on the federal government to balance economic development with climate action. By embedding clean fuels, electrification, and marine clean tech into today’s port investments, Canada can lead as a strong G7 economy, a responsible ocean nation, and a partner in building a climate-competitive future.",https://climateinstitute.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/modernizing-canada-ports.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:31.792561

In early September, African leaders convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Second Africa Climate Summit, which focused on overcoming the obstacles to climate-resilient development on the continent. In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action.

As part of that process, they are increasingly recognizing that decarbonizing shipping – an industry that generates nearly 3% of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialization.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations’ maritime regulator.

Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar.

A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialization, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2% of global investment in renewables.

But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless.

Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments.

If designed properly, the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit.

Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.

A quiet revolution is underway in the maritime sector. Often obscured from popular view, yet championed by emerging innovators and leaders in the ports and shipping world, the global maritime industry is at the heart of a clean energy revolution.

While headlines are dominated by tariff strife and shifting climate politics, global shipping is propelled by a powerful counter-narrative of rapid and far-reaching decarbonisation. Once dismissed as a ""hard-to-abate"" sector, the maritime industry’s complex and interconnected global network is a perfectly positioned platform for large-scale climate action.

From hard-to-abate to First Movers

Recent decisions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have set the global shipping sector on a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, with binding interim targets for 2030 and 2040. This top-down policy direction is being reinforced by bottom-up market demand, as cargo owners increasingly commit to decarbonising their supply chains. Amazon has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040, while IKEA has committed 100 percent zero-emission ocean shipping within the same timeframe/

These combined forces of regulatory ambition and market demand are driving a systemic transformation across the maritime value chain. Meeting this challenge will require coordinated action, innovative solutions, and the collaborative engagement of stakeholders across the global maritime sector.

Once dismissed as a ""hard-to-abate"" sector, the maritime industry’s complex and interconnected global network is a perfectly positioned platform for large-scale climate action.

Corridors of Collaboration

For decades, the ports of Shanghai and Los Angeles have worked together despite geopolitical rifts. In 2022, they co-launched the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, one of the world's first initiatives to commit to deploying zero-emission vessels and fuels across the busiest trans-Pacific trade route. By linking cities, ports, carriers, and fuel providers, this shows how a shared climate vision can transcend political boundaries.

Beyond Shipping: Cities at the forefront of decarbonisation

Decarbonising maritime transport is not just a shipping story. Cities bear a significant share of the burden. Communities adjacent to ports experience elevated rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases, highlighting the urgent need for action on local air quality. At the same time, port decarbonisation can unlock new opportunities for cities, driving economic development, spurring innovation, and creating high-quality green jobs that position local economies at the forefront of the clean energy transition.

Port cities are increasingly emerging as leaders in climate and clean energy innovation. Barcelona exemplifies this approach: the city government and port authority are aligning port electrification and shore power projects with citywide climate and energy strategies. This integrated approach enables Barcelona to advance its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, while simultaneously reducing pollution and improving health outcomes for residents.

In Durban, South Africa, the city and port authority are jointly pursuing renewable energy deployment and electrified port operations. These upgrades not only align with Durban’s climate commitments but also support the city’s trade capacity under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Yokohama, Japan, offers another illustrative model. The city is partnering with utilities and start-ups to pilot battery tankers that transport electricity from offshore wind farms to residents. This innovative approach directly contributes to Yokohama’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Trade Diversity through Clean Energy Exports

As trade patterns are reshaped by tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions, nations are increasingly pursuing diversified trade strategies while simultaneously vying for position as the future suppliers and exporters of clean fuels. Investments in port and logistics infrastructure are being designed to serve a dual purpose: to expand trade capacity and to capture a share of the evolving global market in green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other low-carbon fuels.

In Canada, the Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur expansion is strengthening direct trade with Europe and Asia, positioning the port as a hub for India and Indo-Pacific markets, while the Port of Halifax is emerging as a future gateway for Canadian clean energy exports. In Peru, the newly inaugurated Port of Chancay provides a Pacific corridor that shortens shipping times to China, enabling direct exports of minerals and, in time, clean fuels to Asia. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the expansion of the Port of Manzanillo will enable it to handle up to 10 million containers annually by 2030, providing the country with a strategic platform to serve both Asia and Latin America.

Investments in port and logistics infrastructure are being designed to serve a dual purpose: to expand trade capacity and to capture a share of the evolving global market in green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other low-carbon fuels.

By anchoring their diversification strategies in clean energy, many countries are positioning themselves not just as resilient trading hubs but as emerging powerhouses in the next era of global energy exports.

Conclusion

Cities are natural leaders in this space: they are hard-wired to improve the health and well-being of their residents. That same instinct enables them to collaborate across borders and political divides. By leading from the ground up, cities are transforming a global industry, proving that political differences do not impede collective action in pursuit of a better future for all.

The Asia Pacific marine emission control systems market was estimated at USD 7.3 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow from USD 8 billion in 2025 to USD 14.5 billion in 2034, at a CAGR of 6.9% according to Global Market Insights Inc.

Region's growing alignment with the global maritime standards, including IMO 2020, which mandates a sulfur cap of 0.5% in marine fuels, escalates marine emission control systems adoption. Countries such as China, South Korea, and Japan have designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs) and implemented strict port emission limits. These regulations compel ship operators to adopt technologies, including scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, to remain compliant, avoid penalties, and ensure continued access to international trade routes, leading to drive the business growth.

Marine emission control systems are technologies installed on ships to reduce harmful pollutants such as sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter from exhaust gases. These systems help vessels comply with international environmental regulations, improve air quality near ports, and support sustainable maritime operations by minimizing the ecological impact of shipping activities.

Rising regional trade and shipping activities, especially in China, India, and Southeast Asia, increase the volume of maritime traffic, creating demand for emission control systems. China's maritime foreign trade volume reached 30.1% of global marine shipping in 2023, increasing by 2.2% points from 2022, as reported by the Transport Planning and Research Institute of China's Ministry of Transport. This increase contributes significantly to air pollution, prompting governments and industry stakeholders to invest in emission control systems. Additionally, cleaner shipping practices are essential to sustain economic growth while minimizing environmental impact, making emission control technologies a strategic necessity.

The Asia Pacific marine emission control systems market was valued at USD 5 billion in 2021 and grew at a CAGR of 13.2% through 2024. Growing implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives by shipping companies across the Asia Pacific is reinforcing the region’s commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. Maritime organizations are increasingly investing in emission control technologies to align with CSR goals, enhance brand reputation, and meet rising stakeholder expectations. These efforts also support national and global sustainability targets, such as carbon neutrality pledges by countries like China, Japan, and South Korea, thereby accelerating the adoption of cleaner marine practices and boosting industry growth.

China is among the dominant countries, on account of the implementation of stringent domestic regulations, including Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in major ports such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, mandating low-sulfur fuel use and emission reduction technologies. Additionally, growing expansion of key players in the country drives the product popularity. For instance, Wärtsilä received a contract in February 2022 to install four scrubber systems on two newbuild ferries. Each 218-meter roll-on/roll-off passenger vessel (ropax), under construction at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) in China, will be equipped with two 25-MW V-SOx hybrid scrubber systems.

South Korea is the fastest-growing region in the market. Rising domestic environmental concerns have led to stricter national policies aimed at improving air quality in port cities, leading to augment the product demand. For instance, the South Korean government, through the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, has implemented strict domestic policies to combat air pollution from ships. In 2020, it established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) around major ports including Busan, Ulsan, and Incheon, requiring vessels at berth and anchorage to use fuel with a maximum 0.1% sulphur content. The government support and policies will encourage key players to invest in emission control systems, strengthening the business scenario.

Asia Pacific Marine Emission Control Systems Market Trends

Aging fleets in the Asia Pacific are undergoing modernization to meet new environmental standards. Retrofitting older vessels with scrubbers, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, and exhaust gas cleaning technologies is becoming a cost-effective alternative to purchasing new ships. Additionally, growing governments and industry bodies financial incentives and technical support for retrofitting projects will complement the product deployment.

Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.","Despite being far from perfect, the world’s first global carbon pricing scheme on any international polluter—global shipping— is expected to be adopted next week.

Countries will meet on October 14-17 for the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC E.2) to formally adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF), designed to help achieve the IMO’s climate targets set out in the 2023 Revised Strategy.

The planned adoption of the legally-binding regulation will be followed by a round of technical negotiations (ISWG-GHG-20) on key details on design and implementation of this flagship climate regulation, on October 20-24.

Sealing the deal next week on the IMO NZF, agreed in a vote back in April, would be the biggest victory for climate diplomacy in recent years. It would also send an important signal ahead of the COP in Belém that multilateralism can deliver climate action.

Back in April 2025, the IMO agreed on the NZF in a vote at MEPC 83, with a clear majority of countries (63) voting in favor, including China, Brazil, the EU27, South Korea and India, versus a minority opposition (16) led by the Saudis, the UAE and Russia. 25 countries abstained, including Pacific Island states who chose to abstain as a protest against the decision-making process and the weak level of ambition in the agreed framework.

Key supporters are expected to include: most of the BRICS, the EU27, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Panama, and Chile.

The shipping industry supports adoption through the World Shipping Council (WSC), with over 180 global shipping companies stating the NZF is necessary to provide a global regulatory certainty that “allows the industry to do its job.”

A minority of petrostates led by Saudi Arabia and the US have been trying to undermine the agreement since April. Pacific Island states abstained during the April vote as a protest against the process.

Critical policy details in the NZF still remain to be finalized between the adoption and 2027 when it enters into force, including the definition and rewards for zero-emission energy and technologies and how the revenues, worth up to $15 billion/year from 2030, will be spent.

“While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific Island nations are forced to consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake. We are here [at the IMO] to lead high ambition, as we always have. Our abstention at MEPC 83 was a signal: Tuvalu will not rubber-stamp weak outcomes. At this Extraordinary Session, we call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival. The IMO must find the courage to deliver this time,” Simon Kofe, Minister of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs, Tuvalu, stressed.

“The successful adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework is essential as a baseline for the international shipping industry to achieve the emissions reductions that are so desperately needed. But that is only the start – not the end – of states’ abilities to push for the ambition demanded by climate vulnerable countries. Negotiations around the definition of zero, or near-zero fuels and the distribution of revenues will cement this agreement as one that prioritises justice and equity in the maritime transition,” Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, said.

“The Net Zero Fund established under the IMO Net Zero Framework offers a crucial opportunity to make the maritime transition more equitable. For Africa, where fleets are limited and ageing, and where access to traditional ship finance has been scarce, fair access to this Fund could enable the renewal of vessels and support the continent’s ambitions under the African Continental Free Trade Area. To ensure a truly just and inclusive transition, it’s essential that the Fund’s design includes dedicated financing windows for developing economies,” Maria Ogbugo, Maritime Consultant at the Africa Policy Research Institute, commented.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect – lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels, and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition – but it is a vital step forward. During this meeting, IMO Member States must not only adopt the Net-Zero Framework but agree on a realistic and robust plan for fixing the framework’s failings and putting shipping on a truly sustainable path to zero-emission shipping,” Delaine McCullough, President of the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), highlighted.

“The clarity that will be given with the adoption of the Net Zero Framework should not be underestimated. This key policy signal and associated guidelines have the potential to unlock billions of dollars of investment in the production of scalable zero emission fuels early on. Only with the adoption as soon as possible does the IMO have a chance to meet its objectives from the Revised GHG strategy for zero- or near-zero emission fuels making up 5% to 10% of shipping fuel by 2030,” Nishatabbas Rehmatulla, Principal Research Fellow at the UCL Energy Institute, Shipping & Oceans Research Group, explained.

“Ahead of the IMO Net-Zero Framework vote, the facts are undeniable: LNG is not a viable solution for shipping. Methane — a highly potent greenhouse gas, 82 times that of CO2 — from LNG-fueled ships grew by 180% between 2016 and 2023, directly contradicting industry rhetoric. LNG is fundamentally incompatible with shipping’s decarbonization goals. Regardless of its origin (fossil, bio-, or e-LNG), methane leaks across the entire fuel lifecycle. LNG must be excluded from the Net-Zero Framework, or the IMO risks enabling a false solution and undermining its climate credibility,” Elissama Menezes, Director at Equal Routes, said.

“Member states have never waited for permission to lead. Regardless of the United States’ stance, member states must hold firm and get the Net-Zero Framework over the finish line in October. The International Maritime Organization’s April agreement is a win for our climate, health and oceans, marking the first time the shipping industry agreed to a global carbon price. Now, they must see it through—not only for the planet we share, but to honor the family legacy we owe to future generations: a legacy of health, security, and prosperity.We applaud this decisive step toward a just, zero-emissions future in shipping,” Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director with Pacific Environment, stated.

Global shipping industry strongly supports IMO NZF

International maritime associations and organizations have reiterated their “strong support” for the adoption by the world’s governments of IMO NZF.

The global industry said it remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully “this carefully balanced” regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050, with necessary incentives to de-risk investment in new green marine fuels to accelerate the total decarbonization of international shipping and to implement a just transition for the maritime workforce.

“Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation. With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field,” WSC, International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), and the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) emphasized in a joint statement.

The maritime transport sector, which moves 90% of global trade, is ready to play its important part in delivering a sustainable future.

He emphasised that batteries are the main way in which the ferry sector can decarbonise. “Batteries are the first, second and third place option. I don’t think there’s a clear indication on other fuels, and the main thing is we know batteries work, that electrification works, and that is why we are pushing it so hard. Some of our members are trying methanol and hydrogen, but I think the short- and medium-term solution is electrification.”

A major topic at the Interferry annual conference – held in Sorrento, Italy this year – was the lack of shore power available at ports.

Mr Corrigan commented, “We are pushing for it hard, and I think everybody wants to do the right thing, but it is a complicated endeavour. There are the electrical companies, the governments – all players that work together to get the funding. But even if they manage it, it can take up to 10 years to get the infrastructure in place to charge these vessels.”

He singled out just one ferry would need 40 or 50 MW of power.

“We work closely with port associations and do outreach with the local communities, but it is a multi-pronged approach, Interferry, operators, the ports and everybody.”

Another issue for Interferry, which was covered at the conference, is the potential for double taxation for ferry operators, should IMO affirm its rules on fuel intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. These instruments would be parallel with the EU’s policies on emissions and fuels, the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Mr Corrigan warned, “We demand the threat of double taxation be removed as it will kill our operators and could quadruple fuel costs in a few years. That has to go to the customer at the end of the day. That is the challenge, you can’t be taxed twice in two different jurisdictions, it is not done anywhere else.”

He points out the IMO MEPC session in October has to pass the motion on the legislation. If it does, there is the potential for double taxation. “We will be leaning on the EU to not have that happen.”

Asked about his key takeaways from the annual conference, which saw connections as its theme, with an emphasis on lifeline ferries, Mr Corrigan said, “It has driven home how important ferries are in the world. The fact is we move as many passengers as the airlines do and bring along cars as well.”

He said the conference highlighted the commonality among ferry operators all over the world, from electrification, to regulations, safety, cyber security and trying to understand what AI is about.

The conference saw Cruise Lines Industry Association chief executive Bud Darr take to the stage, highlighting the potential for more collaboration between the two industry associations. “We have in the past collaborated, but Bud takes us to the next level.” Mr Corrigan points out in his recent role at MSC Group, Mr Darr was part of Interferry’s regulatory committee, representing MSC Group-owned GNV, therefore “it is a natural fit and Bud worked well with us over the year”.

Mr Corrigan sums up, “The conference reinforces the ferry community around the world. People really care about each other; competitors are on the stage talking together. Our job at Interferry is to grow the pie, and our operators can fight over the slices of the pie.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/159/Mike_Corrigan_Interferry.JPG,N,,2025-10-10 08:56:44.651270

Adopting the NZF, it said, would accelerate the shift to zero emissions while ensuring a level playing field for all.

According to the statement, this is “a unique and historic opportunity” for governments to put in place a comprehensive regulatory structure that incentivises green investment, supports a just transition for seafarers, and ensures effective enforcement worldwide.

The framework aims to de-risk investment in new fuels and technologies, ensuring that the journey towards net zero by or close to 2050 remains realistic and inclusive.

Meanwhile, at the closing session of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference this week, the chamber organised a panel discussion titled ‘Protecting Shipowners in a Rapidly Changing Environment’, focusing on the evolving role of ship managers amid mounting global pressures.

The session brought together Mark O’Neil (Columbia Group), Sebastian von Hardenberg (Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement), Dieter Rohdenburg (InterMaritime Shipmanagement) and Jan Meyering (Marlow Navigation), who discussed how Cyprus-based ship management companies are adapting to decarbonisation, digitalisation, ESG compliance, and geopolitical uncertainty.

As explained, Maritime Beyond Methane provides independent evidence-based data that enables and encourages the sector to make tangible commitments towards future-ready shipping solutions.

LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG-dual fuel vessels accounting for 55 percent of the current orderbook. If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10 percent of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030.

At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bio-LNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emission future.

According to the initiative’s statement, the shipping sector is nearing a critical juncture to be able to move the dial on getting off LNG, and avoiding any alternative that enables locking-in methane and going further down a pathway where monetary penalties, costly retrofits and early abandonment of vessels will get more severe with the continued use of methane-based fuels that have no real impact on decarbonizing shipping and addressing the climate crisis.

The global LNG-fueled fleet’s estimated 247,000 tons of methane emissions in 2023 translated to nearly US$950 million in annual climate damages — a near-fourfold increase from 2016, when the figure stood around US$250 million.

This estimate builds on the U.S. EPA’s Social Cost of Methane, a monetary benchmark consistent with internationally recognized values, by incorporating the effects of ground-level ozone, a critical pollutant formed by methane. This figure still understates total harm, excluding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, localized air quality, and non-fatal health outcomes such as asthma and hospitalizations.

In the months ahead, Maritime Beyond Methane will actively engage with the IMO, and with EU regulators through the FuelEU negotiations, to inform decisions in line with global climate ambition, supporting the advancement of regulatory frameworks that use informed decision-making that keeps the shipping sector on track towards a just, net-zero emissions future.

Methane, a greenhouse gas 82 times more potent than CO₂ in the short-term, is the primary component in LNG. Methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships rose 180% between 2016 and 2023, according to MARBEM.

LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG-dual fuel vessels accounting for 55% of the current orderbook.

“If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10 percent of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030,” MARBEM stated in a release, adding: “At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bio-LNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emission future.”

LNG as a future fuel will be debated a great deal at next week’s vote on the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework.

Elissama Menezes and Andrew Dumbrille, directors of Equal Routes, serve as MARBEM’s secretariat, with the pair writing for Splash last week, suggesting: “Once the IMO applies this comprehensive life-cycle approach under the framework’s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels – LNG, biomethane, and e-methane – cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives, exposing the industry’s rhetoric for what it is: false promises that have propped up LNG all along.

Despite LNG’s popularity as an alternative fuel, methane emissions have been the Achilles’ heel undermining its climate credentials.

However, Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) made headlines on Wednesday when it announced it had achieved a 98% reduction in methane slip during sea trials using a new methane oxidation catalyst and engine modification system aboard an LNG-fuelled coal carrier panamax.

By proving a near-total elimination of slip in real-world sea conditions, MOL and partners may have handed LNG a crucial lifeline in the decarbonisation debate.

In a surprise intervention, Christopher Wiernicki, the departing chairman and CEO of ABS, the third largest shipping classification society in the world, came out against IMO’s planned net zero framework last month.

“Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories. There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation,” Wiernicki said at the launch in London of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook, backing greater support for LNG as a bridging fuel.

“Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways,” Wierniki said, his LNG viewpoint is something that is supported by rival class society DNV.

Peter Keller, chairman of SEA-LNG, a lobby group supporting the super chilled fuel as an alternative shipping fuel, claimed earlier this week: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

LNG’s credentials as shipping’s leading alternative fuel have driven much debate for years, attracting much criticism from academics, NGOs, and even the World Bank.

Overall, 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in the first nine months of 2025, with LNG-fuelled vessels accounting for the majority of these orders at 121, followed by 43 orders for methanol-fuelled ships, with the remainder made up by LPG carriers (19), ammonia-fuelled vessels (5), and hydrogen-fuelled vessels (4), according to data from DNV.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LNGOceanRebellion.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:56:39.363521

Worth noting that any individual state party may file an objection to the IMO NZF, effectively exempting itself from its application.
Conclusion: Outlook for Global Maritime Decarbonisation Failure to reach agreement at IMO level risks accelerating regional fragmentation, as individual states or blocs may advance with their own carbon pricing regimes.
As noted by Lloyd’s List senior reporter Declan Bush, failing to adopt the IMO NZF does not mean climate regulation will go away.","In April 2025, the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (‘MEPC’) approved draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI establishing the IMO Net-Zero Framework (‘IMO NZF’). These draft measures are scheduled for formal adoption at an extraordinary MEPC session to be held from 14 to 17 October 2025, in the IMO headquarters in London, after which they will follow MARPOL’s tacit-acceptance procedure and are expected to enter into force in 2027. The IMO NZF is widely regarded as the first global regulatory regime to combine a mandatory marine fuel-intensity standard with an economic pricing and compliance mechanism across an entire industrial sector.

The IMO NZF will form a new Chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex VI, applying to sea-going ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above; vessels which collectively account for roughly 85% of international shipping’s CO₂ emissions.

At present, 108 state parties are bound by Annex VI, covering about 97% of the world’s merchant fleet by tonnage. The IMO NZF aligns with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, which commits the sector to reach net-zero GHG emissions “by or around 2050” with indicative checkpoints for 2030 and 2040.

At the heart of the IMO NZF lies a global Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (‘GFI’) standard, based on lifecycle or “well-to-wake” accounting that measures emissions across both upstream fuel production and onboard combustion.

In essence, what this means is that, under the IMO NZF, shipowners will be required to account for the greenhouse gas emissions (‘GHG’) generated across the entire lifecycle of marine fuels, from extraction and production through to onboard combustion, a process referred to as “well-to-wake” assessment. This encompasses both “tank-to-wake” emissions produced during fuel use onboard, and “well-to-tank” emissions arising from the upstream stages of fuel production, processing, and transport, including associated sustainability considerations.

Compliance Mechanisms and the Net-Zero Fund

Each ship will be required to achieve progressive reductions in fuel intensity over time, measured against two benchmarks: a Base GFI Target representing the minimum performance threshold, and a more stringent and ambitious Direct Compliance Target. Essentially, the fuel mix of a vessel complying solely with the Base Target would result in a higher average annual GFI compared to that of a vessel also achieving the Direct Compliance Target. In calculating compliance with the GFI targets, shipowners will be required to report the full “well-to-wake” emissions of their fuels, covering both production and sourcing, as well as onboard combustion. This will create a need for a robust certification system to verify the carbon intensity and sustainability credentials of fuels. Fuel producers aiming to supply low-carbon fuels for IMO compliance, along with bunkering companies and shipowners, will need to understand and operate within this new certification framework.

Ships that exceed the Direct Compliance Target will generate Surplus Units, which may be sold, banked or transferred to other vessels. If a vessel fails to meet its target, compliance can be restored either by using the Surplus Units generated within its own fleet/acquired from other fleets, or by purchasing Remedial Units through contributions to the IMO-managed Net-Zero Fund.

The IMO is presenting the Net-Zero Fund as a fund which will serve as both a compliance backstop and an incentive pool. It is being stated that payments from non-compliant ships will finance research and development, fuel-infrastructure deployment, and capacity-building initiatives, particularly for developing countries, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. Funds may also be allocated to reward operators that exceed the required emission-reduction targets, with the aim of directing financial flows toward supporting decarbonisation while promoting a fair and equitable transition across the sector.

The International Chamber of Shipping (‘ICS’), representing over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, has welcomed the IMO NZF and emphasised that “the IMO needs to formally adopt the Net-Zero Framework in October to send a clear signal to industry and provide the incentive needed to produce these cleaner fuels. Industry needs clarity, simplicity, and detail on the rewards.”

In a statement to Lloyd’s List, the leaders of seven major shipowner associations, including those of Japan, Singapore and the UK, urged IMO member states to “make history in London” by adopting the Net-Zero Framework, describing it as “set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.”

If adopted in October, the IMO NZF will mark a major milestone in the regulatory architecture for maritime decarbonisation. Following adoption, the IMO will finalise detailed guidelines on certification, lifecycle-emission calculation, and registry rules at MEPC 84 in 2026, with data collection and reporting expected to commence in 2028.

Interplay with Regional Frameworks

While the IMO NZF has received broad industry support, notable regional and political complexities persist, with opposition to the measures becoming more pronounced in recent months. Within the EU, the Fit for 55 legislative package encompasses the Emissions Trading System (‘EU ETS’), the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (‘Fuel EU Maritime’), along with other measures.

The EU ETS has applied to maritime transport since 1 January 2024 for ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at EU or EEA ports, with surrender obligations phasing in from 40% of 2024 emissions to full coverage by 2027. Global mid-term measures under the IMO, such as the NZF, are not currently considered equivalent to the EU ETS, and the European Commission has yet to determine whether they should be treated as such. As a result, the implications for EU decision-making within the broader Fit for 55 framework remain uncertain.

Having said that, the revised EU ETS Directive includes a review clause requiring the Commission to assess ETS provisions following the adoption of any IMO global market-based measure, ensuring regulatory coherence and avoiding double regulation. If the IMO adopts such a measure, the Commission must submit a report within 18 months evaluating ambition, environmental integrity, and alignment with EU law, and may propose legislative amendments to harmonise the regimes. Should no IMO measure be adopted by 2028, the Commission may propose expanding the EU ETS so that surrender obligations for voyages between EU and non-EU ports cover more than 50% of emissions.

Adding to this complexity, the FuelEU Maritime is comparable to the IMO NZF in that it sets mandatory limits on the GHG intensity of fuels used onboard, with targets that become increasingly ambitious over time. There is therefore potential duplication between the FuelEU Maritime and the IMO NZF, as a non-compliant ship could, in theory, be penalised under both regimes. The FuelEU Maritime acknowledges this overlap and also includes a review clause obliging the European Commission to reassess its provisions if the IMO adopts a global fuel standard or market-based measure, with a view to aligning EU provisions with international requirements where appropriate. Further clarity will be needed from the Commission on how such overlaps will be managed, particularly as the IMO NZF is still in the process of becoming fully operational.

The ICS has urged the European Commission and other jurisdictions with regional schemes to align with the forthcoming IMO regime, noting that “those with unilateral and regional schemes, such as the EU ETS, should agree to having one clear and transparent system under the IMO. This is critical if we are to meet the time frames set out.” The call reflects growing industry concern that overlapping carbon pricing frameworks could undermine regulatory certainty and slow the sector’s decarbonisation investment momentum.

Political and Industry Landscape

The adoption of the IMO NZF will also test international consensus. At MEPC 83 in April, agreement was reached with 63 countries voting in favour, 16 against, and 24 abstaining. Although the vote passed, it marked a departure from the IMO’s usual preference for consensus. Several states, including the United States, have raised concerns about the pricing element, describing it as a de facto global tax.

Adoption, as expected in October’s MEPC extraordinary session, requires approval by a two-thirds majority of parties to Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention that are present and voting at the session itself. Following approval, the IMO NZF would undergo MARPOL’s tacit-acceptance procedure and is then expected to enter into force approximately 16 months later, around early 2027. This is unless one-third or more of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or parties representing not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet, object to the measures within the said timeframe. Worth noting that any individual state party may file an objection to the IMO NZF, effectively exempting itself from its application.

Conclusion: Outlook for Global Maritime Decarbonisation

Failure to reach agreement at IMO level risks accelerating regional fragmentation, as individual states or blocs may advance with their own carbon pricing regimes. This would expose ships to overlapping and potentially inconsistent charges depending on their trading routes, an outcome that would undermine regulatory clarity and efficiency. As noted by Lloyd’s List senior reporter Declan Bush, failing to adopt the IMO NZF does not mean climate regulation will go away. Instead, it will likely mean more rules, not fewer. The forthcoming vote will therefore be pivotal in determining whether maritime decarbonisation proceeds along a unified global trajectory or splinters into a patchwork of regional frameworks.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/5219a30978885d6004deccc0cd324e9e2cde65f6-1760083950-352f1b3c-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:56:06.606672

Installing wind assisted propulsion technology isn’t just about cutting fuel costs.
In a world where jobs are being replaced by emerging technologies, wind propulsion is one innovation that actually creates them.
This means that wind propulsion can help you meet IMO’s decarbonisation standards faster and more cheaply.
Wind propulsion is a win-win: clean energy, lower costs and more skilled jobs and the energy is free, clean and available now.","The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is upcoming. Wind-assisted propulsion cuts costs, creates jobs, and earns compliance bonuses—delivering climate action, affordable trade, and a just transition, argues Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas At Risk.

As the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization (IMO) prepares to meet in London to discuss the finer details of how to decarbonise the shipping industry, member states hold many cards. The question is, how will they choose to play them? Some will push for ambition, some will stall, and some may even play their ‘trump card’ to try and block progress altogether, but one play is clear: adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF) on how to decarbonise shipping is vital if progress is to be made.

Adopting the IMO’s NZF is a no-brainer but competitiveness, job security and freight costs will weigh heavily on decision-making when designing and implementing the Framework. Since the IMO did state that “the transition [to decarbonisation] should be just and equitable”, I am here to play my wind propulsion card.

I was recently involved in commissioning Seas At Risk’s Wind First report, and the results confirmed what many of us already suspected: Ships equipped with suction sails or rotor sails can cut fuel costs by up to 18%, which actually means savings of up to half a million dollars per ship, per year. These savings will help ship owners pay for new, expensive e-fuels coming in the future. It also means that they will be less affected by fuel price volatility and emission compliance costs demanded by the EU and IMO. By retrofitting sails on existing vessels or designing brand new ships altogether means that shipping costs stay steadier and everyday products don’t get even more expensive for consumers.

Installing wind assisted propulsion technology isn’t just about cutting fuel costs. In a world where jobs are being replaced by emerging technologies, wind propulsion is one innovation that actually creates them. Shipyards and port workers around the world can be trained to install and maintain wind systems, and, given time, can even manufacture parts. As more ships adopt wind assisted propulsion, installation capacity and technical training must be scaled up to avoid bottlenecks. This offers real and skilled jobs to shipyards and ports particularly in Africa, Latin America and small island developing nations, who can become hubs of new maritime jobs.

So far, wind assisted propulsion is starting to get its wings (pun intended), but it still has a way to go before it’s widely adopted in the industry. That’s where the IMO’s NZF comes into play. While the framework mainly focuses on reducing fuel intensity and shifting from polluting fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, through the guidelines, it has the potential to also reward clean technologies such as wind through “technology-specific multipliers”. In other words, every tonne of CO2 you cut with wind power earns you extra “credits”, giving ships a compliance bonus, or financial incentive for meeting their targets, on top of their fuel savings.

This means that wind propulsion can help you meet IMO’s decarbonisation standards faster and more cheaply. A higher compliance value under the NZF will speed up global adoption and attract investment into emerging markets. For lower- and middle-income countries, supporting the framework is not only about climate, it’s about creating jobs, strengthening industrial capacity, and keeping trade affordable.

So, all of this to ask the delegates who will attend the IMO next week to not just adopt the Framework, but use the technical negotiations that will follow to give wind propulsion the spot they merit: as the first, best solution in the toolbox.

In the days leading up to the extraordinary IMO session in London, divisions have deepened between powerful shipping nations and industry heavyweights. On one side, seven major shipowner associations from Japan, Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Singapore have issued a rare joint appeal urging governments to “make history” by endorsing the framework. On the other, opposition has coalesced around influential figures such as John Fredriksen, prominent Greek shipping groups, key classification societies, and even the United States government.

The coalition of supporting associations described the NZF as a “turning point for global climate regulation,” warning that failure to adopt it would fragment the sector with a “patchwork of regional rules” and undermine the global energy transition. “Our industry, by its very nature, is global — and it needs a global solution to tackle climate change,” their statement declared.

If approved, the framework would introduce a global carbon levy and fuel standard to steer the shipping sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. It would also establish a Net Zero Fund to incentivize compliance and finance green maritime infrastructure.

While expressing general support for the framework’s goals, the global tanker association INTERTANKO urged caution on implementation timelines. “The NZF offers clarity and predictability,” said Emma Scheiris, INTERTANKO’s deputy director for environment. “But its rollout must balance ambition with operational feasibility.”

However, major shipowners — including Dynacom, GasLog, Seapeak, and Stolt Tankers — have publicly opposed the plan, calling for “critical amendments” before it is adopted. Collectively, they control a significant share of the world’s tanker and gas carrier capacity. “In its current form, the NZF does not deliver on its stated aim of fair and effective decarbonisation,” the group said.

Greece’s shipping minister Vassilis Kikilias echoed their concerns during talks with IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, insisting that “substantive changes are essential” for Greece to lend its support.

Despite the pushback, Dominguez remains optimistic. “I am confident the framework will be adopted,” he told delegates in London. “We have a long history of overcoming divisions through cooperation.”

The IMO traditionally relies on consensus, but insiders suggest that a formal vote now appears inevitable. If members fail to reach agreement, approval will require backing from two-thirds of the 176 MARPOL Annex VI signatories — at least 108 countries.

Backing from the Getting to Zero Coalition, which represents more than 180 companies and some of the world’s largest shipowners, has intensified pressure on member states. “Delays threaten billions in clean shipping investments,” the group warned. “Without global rules, costs will rise for everyone — from shipowners to consumers.”

Complicating the picture, the United States remains staunchly opposed to the NZF. Washington walked out of April’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting and has since warned that nations supporting the deal could face trade and diplomatic repercussions, including tariffs, port charges, or visa restrictions.

Analysts say the outcome could hinge on a handful of undecided countries — particularly in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America — where geopolitical and economic priorities are finely balanced.

“FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise,” he said.
Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to ask critical questions before joining any pooling scheme: Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they?
“In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for,” Mr Ioulianou concludes.
Look for partners with the expertise, systems, and integrity to manage risk—because compliance doesn’t come cheap, and neither should your standards.”","With the EU ETS reporting deadline passed and FuelEU Maritime enforcement fast approaching, EmissionLink Managing Director, Philippos Ioulianou, has cautioned shipowners against treating compliance pooling as a cost-cutting exercise, warning that a cheap pool that hides risk is worse than no pool at all.

Pooling has rapidly become one of the industry’s hottest topics as operators seek efficient pathways to meet FuelEU and ETS obligations. Yet according to Mr Ioulianou, a fixation on price risks undermining the very purpose of the regulation.

“FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise,” he said. “It’s a fundamental shift in regulatory responsibility. If shipowners view it simply as a budget line item, they risk stepping into the very pitfalls the regulation was designed to prevent.”

Pooling allows operators, particularly smaller fleets or those lacking access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels. When managed correctly, it can smooth compliance and lower costs. But mismanaged pooling can expose participants to significant liabilities.

Once in a pool, a vessel’s carbon intensity is tied to that of every other participant. If one underperforms, or if the pool manager fails to act, all members face penalties. That raises crucial governance questions around performance monitoring, mid-year corrective actions, and responsibility for penalties or surpluses.

Mr Ioulianou warns that many pooling schemes on offer today focus mainly on cost, often using market indexes as benchmarks, while ignoring governance, accountability, and risk management.

“Price references may guide cost but they don’t account for who’s responsible when things go wrong. Strong governance, continuous monitoring, and maritime expertise are what make pooling viable. Without them, the compliance risk multiplies.”

Drawing parallels with the IMO’s proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), Mr Ioulianou noted that similar governance challenges are emerging at a global level.

“The same dynamic is visible in the IMO debate. Ambition is outpacing accountability. Regulators are setting decarbonisation timelines that don’t fully reflect fuel availability or technological maturity. The lesson is clear, without governance and industry alignment, frameworks don’t reduce risk—they redistribute it.”

As Columbia Group CEO Mark O’Neil observed during LISW, the gap is most evident with alternative fuels. Their potential is clear, but the challenges of adoption and the pace at which the industry can transition must be carefully managed.

Central to EmissionLink’s approach is the belief that pooling only works when built on transparency, continuous monitoring and maritime expertise. Participants must know how performance is tracked continuously, not just at reporting deadlines, and someone must carry responsibility if things go wrong.

Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to ask critical questions before joining any pooling scheme:

Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they?

What happens if performance dips?

How are penalties and surpluses distributed?

How do FuelEU, EU ETS, and IMO frameworks align—or conflict?

“In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for,” Mr Ioulianou concludes. “Don’t be seduced by the cheapest pool. Look for partners with the expertise, systems, and integrity to manage risk—because compliance doesn’t come cheap, and neither should your standards.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EmissionLink-empowers-shipowners-to-minimise-FuelEU-impact-through-accurate-emissions-data-and-predictive-insights.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:56:52.934083
