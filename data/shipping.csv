International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net- zero Framework (NZF) is said to hold great promise for climate action in the form of green shipping, but there is great uncertainty surrounding its future. What was supposed to be a step towards establishing a global legally binding framework to decarbonise global shipping has been halted by the threat of tariffs and other punitive measures by the United States (U.S.) on countries that support the undertaking. Notably, the U.S. was not alone in thwarting IMO members’ shipping carbon reduction efforts, as Saudi Arabia, a leading petroleum power, proposed the motion to delay voting on the adoption of the agreement for a year, and many countries backtracked on their initial support. The balancing act involved in global climate efforts, in this case, attempts at decarbonising shipping, and economic interests, is always one worth exploring, as interests matter and this is demonstrated by the results of this initiative. In this article, I explore the interests and the costs of this framework.

Unpacking the IMO Net-zero Framework

The IMO Net-zero Framework was approved for circulation by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at its Eighty-Third session in April 2025 to set international standards geared towards curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the shipping sector. Poised to form part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollutiofrom Ships (MARPOL), Annex VI, the draft legal text was circulated and due for adoption in October 2025, but it stalled due to resistance by concerned members. Over 100 member states gathered in London to vote on the draft document, with 57 countries supporting adjournment, 49 opposing it, and 21 abstaining.

At the centre of its opposition are the two key elements of the framework, namely, a global fuel standard and an economic measure geared towards reducing carbon emissions from ships. Essentially, the fuel standard sets the rules to get vessels, over time, to minimise the GHG emissions per unit of energy used, and it considers emissions through the entire life-cycle of fuel from production to consumption. The economic measure refers to a two-tiered pollution system with annually increasing GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets, which prescribe maximum limits on GHG emissions per unit for large vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage which emit 85% of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas. This mechanism is based on a carbon credits trading scheme, where a set number of credits is allocated to ships. Ships emitting above their GFI thresholds (exceeding their credits) will be required to purchase remedial units to cover the excess.

In simple terms, think of it as a bank account; in this case, the ship has a certain amount of money (GHG emission limit) to participate in shipping, and if the ship goes over, it would be synonymous with having an overdrawn account and would accrue a penalty. In this case, the shipping company pays the penalty in the form of remedial units to offset going beyond the limit.

Conversely, vessels with lower emissions benefit financially through a rewards system, earning credits, with the option of selling their credits to vessels with high emissions. Consequently, ships that exceed set limits have to pay, while those that are net zero or near net zero benefit. Under this framework, the money paid for exceeding limits would go into the IMO-Net Zero Fund. This fund is then used to reward ships with low emissions, support member states’ NZF transition and any other associated initiatives. Employing such measures is believed to be a force for driving clean shipping, fostering technological innovation in sustainable shipping and facilitating capacity building (much like the Caribbean Shipping Lanes Project). This sounds quite doable; pay when you pollute in excess. However, states like the U.S. are concerned with the costs for paying ‘the cost’.

Costs for Paying ‘the cost’

While NZF proponents see the merit of the proposed system in fostering GHG emissions reductions, U.S. President Donald Trump views it as a “Global Green New Scam Tax”. The U.S. Department of State dubbed what, if adopted, could have been the world’s first global environmental tax an injurious initiative. Washington suggests that the NZF could have an adverse trickle-down effect on the American people and the global economy through increased shipping costs. As a result, the U.S. threatened retaliatory measures against states voting in favour of the draft text in the form of visa restrictions and sanctions on state officials, blocking and increasing port fees on vessels from such states, and commercial penalties. What is noteworthy is that Caribbean states, Antigua and Barbuda and the Bahamas, opted to abstain citing transitional concerns, notwithstanding their advocacy for climate change. Also interesting is that China, a trading powerhouse, initially supported the plan but then changed its position.

To say that the concerns about the potential increases in energy and consumer prices are illegitimate would be disingenuous, as this has been a primary concern for many. Based on calculations from the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, a vessel utilising the IMO’s recommended environmentally friendly very low sulfur fuel could face an additional $1.5 million in annual operating expenses.

There is a high likelihood that the costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher merchandise prices. This will ultimately affect import-dependent countries such as those in the Caribbean. Moreover, the ability of firms to acquire vessels with green technology or upgrade them to support the green shipping transition is also a consideration. Then there are petroleum states, such as Saudi Arabia and increasingly Guyana, which stand to be adversely affected as

their oil sectors are a central part of their economies. However, while transition costs are an essential consideration, so are the real and lived experiences of the effects of climate change.

The Climate Cost

Economists argue that there are opportunity costs for choices made, and the same can be applied in balancing the priorities for economic growth with the environment. Although Caribbean states have not historically contributed to climate change, for all of them, the effects are real and lived experiences. Faced with supersonic monster hurricanes, like hurricane Melissa that ravaged Caribbean countries in October 2025, rising sea levels, droughts and increased temperatures, coastal erosion, progress in climate change adaptation is a matter of lives and livelihood. At the same time, many Caribbean countries are import-reliant economies and the effects of the NZF can appear daunting.

Power politics always seem to stymy adaptation progress, from the 1982 UN Law of the Sea, to the 2015 Paris Agreement, and now the pause in the IMO NZF. In this matter, the concerns raised have some legitimacy. IMO members should use this pause to work through the questions and issues of members with an aim to get closer to a plan that can see the reduction of GHG in shipping. Every effort on every front counts, on the journey to sustainability.

LNG-fuelled vessels dominated the month’s activity with 26 orders, all from the container segment. The remaining four orders were for methanol-fuelled vessels, with three in the tankers segment.

Despite October’s uptick, the year-to-date picture remains subdued. A total of 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in the first 10 months of 2025, representing just 52% of orders placed during the same period in 2024. LNG-fuelled vessels continue to lead with 67% of all alternative-fuel orders this year, totaling 147 ships. Methanol-fuelled vessels follow with 47 orders, while LPG carriers account for 19, ammonia-fuelled vessels for 5, and hydrogen-fuelled vessels for 4.

The container segment now dominates alternative-fuel vessel orders, accounting for 65% of all new orders in 2025.

Infrastructure investment also advanced in October, with four LNG bunker vessels and two bunker vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel added to the orderbook. While these vessels are not included in alternative-fuelled vessel statistics, they represent continued commitment to supporting the emerging alternative-fuelled fleet.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime, welcomed the improvement while acknowledging ongoing challenges. “Following some weak months, it is encouraging to see stronger numbers in the alternative-fuelled space in October, both for vessels and with further investment in bunkering infrastructure. While activity remains well below last year’s levels, it is important to recognize that this is happening within a weaker overall newbuild market,” Stefanatos said.

Regulatory uncertainty has been identified as a key factor affecting market sentiment. Stefanatos previously noted that “uncertainties around the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, including lifecycle assessment factors for certain fuels, are prompting many owners to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach to new orders.”

Last month, the IMO postponed the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework by one year following pressure from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026. The framework aims to bring international shipping emissions down to net zero by 2050 and would create the world’s first global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping, with revenues expected to reach up to $15 billion annually from 2030.

“Although issues of regulatory uncertainty are yet to be solved, the push for maritime decarbonization continues, led by the container segment and driven by a range of actors, including cargo owners, financiers, and shipowners themselves. This continued commitment across the industry signals that the transition to cleaner fuels remains firmly on the agenda,” Stefanatos added.

The IMO will reconvene for technical working group talks from April 20-24, 2026, followed by the 84th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee from April 27 to May 1.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shutterstock_1925152076-800x391.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:59:58.251418

Delegates at the International Maritime Organization (I.M.O.), a United Nations body that regulates international shipping, voted 57-49 to delay adopting the Net Zero Framework (N.Z.F.) by at least a year, postponing rules that would have required ships to cut emissions starting in 2028. The framework, which was first agreed upon in April 2025, aimed to make shipping the first global industry with binding climate regulations, including a carbon-pricing system to incentivize cleaner fuels and penalize harmful excess emissions.

International leaders reacted quickly with divided responses. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the delay as “another huge win” for Trump, commending the president for protecting American consumers from what he called a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” according to PBS News. In contrast, European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera described the delay as “a huge shame” and reaffirmed Europe’s commitment to ambitious global climate standards (Politico). Based on AP News, Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, called the decision “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change,” noting that island nations are already confronting rising seas and extreme weather events. Environmental NGOs (non-governmental organizations) like Transport & Environment and Opportunity Green expressed extreme concern that the delay jeopardizes efforts to reduce emissions, as Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment states, “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” according to PBS News.

This outcome is concerning from a climate perspective. The N.Z.F. was designed to create uniform regulations that would have allowed shipping companies to invest in greener technologies. Thomas Kazakos, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping, emphasized that “industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” as noted by the BBC. By succumbing to pressure from fossil-fuel-producing nations, the I.M.O. missed an opportunity to enforce global standards and encourage the use of alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol. While the U.S. celebrated the decisions as a protection of domestic economic interests, the broader consequence is a delay in global efforts to combat climate change, which puts vulnerable communities, especially in the Pacific and the Caribbean, at extreme risk.

The conflict comes from rising tensions between the need to address climate change, the desire of countries to protect their economies, and the influence of global political power. It shows the flash of governmental goals, money, and politics. Shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without any intervention, the I.M.O. has projected that these emissions could grow by 10% and even up to 150% by 2050, according to BBC reporting. The N.Z.F. would have required ships to gradually transition away from the use of heavy fuel oil, impose fees for extra carbon emissions, and encourage support for using cleaner fuel alternatives. Countries including China, the European Union, Brazil, and the U.K. support the plan, while Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the U.S. oppose it, worrying about costs and effects on the economy. Based on AP News reporting, this is similar to previous international negotiations, such as the failed global plastic treaty earlier in 2025, where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blocked regulations even though most countries agreed that there was urgent environmental action needed.",https://theowp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0_wmDPQ-UpLBV7413M.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:04:09.532060

This delay raises concerns that regional legislation and Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) may emerge as alternatives to the anticipated global framework. The European Union’s ETS, initially viewed as a temporary measure, is now poised to take center stage as a model for other regions.

New EU Guidelines on Methane Reporting

On October 8, 2025, the European Commission unveiled its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. This marks a pivotal moment for shipowners, allowing them to substitute conservative default methane values with actual measured data, verified in line with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83). Previously, the FuelEU default tables focused solely on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, neglecting methane slip (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) factors associated with various renewable fuels, including bio- and e-methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and dual-fuel engines.

The absence of verified data for these fuels could lead to inaccuracies in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reporting, potentially exposing shipowners to higher emissions costs. Fortunately, the IMO MEPC.402(83) provides a framework for measuring both methane and nitrous oxide emissions onboard vessels. The new EU guidelines outline how to report verified CH₄ factors under FuelEU, with procedures for N₂O expected to follow shortly. Existing technology, such as VPS Emsys, can continuously measure and verify emissions of CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O, while automatically generating a Methane File ready for verification.

The initiative also seeks public sector contributions, aiming to reach US$6.5Bn by 2035.

According to Greek shipbroker Intermodal, these plans target modernising shipyards, including replacing outdated machinery, installing larger cranes and adopting advanced automation and digital technologies.

Additionally, the Japanese government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United States to expand collaboration, with Washington pursuing similar opportunities with South Korea.

A new chapter in innovation

These investments are centered on technological innovation. “Japan’s industry is advancing zero-emissions vessels, autonomous ships and IoT-enabled solutions through collaborations with R&D centres, universities and think tanks,” said Intermodal senior analyst Nikos Tagoulis.

By 2040, Japan aims to become a leader in autonomous and zero-emissions shipbuilding, targeting half of its domestic fleet to be autonomous.

“Rather than prioritising sheer production volume, the focus is on innovation and value-added technological solutions that enhance both vessel performance and overall quality,” Mr Tagoulis added.

He noted while Japan’s global market share may remain broadly stable, eco-friendly technologies, efficiency-enhancing solutions and strategic partnerships could boost profitability and reinforce its international standing.

Fallen share and market challenges

“These efforts come as Japan seeks to regain ground in a shipbuilding landscape that has shifted dramatically over the past two decades,” Mr Tagoulis said.

Intermodal data shows that while Japan once commanded more than 35% of new orders, its share has declined from 26% in 2017 to just over 10% as of October 2025, coinciding with rapid growth in China.

The Japanese orderbook currently comprises 737 vessels totalling 40.7M dwt, primarily bulk carriers, tankers and container ships. Regarding alternative fuels, 10% of vessels may use methanol and approximately 4% are LNG-capable. Moreover, 32% of ordered tonnage will be scrubber-fitted.

Consolidation amid structural constraints

In response to market pressures, Japan’s shipbuilding sector has undergone consolidations to sustain competitiveness.

Significant developments include Imabari Shipbuilding increasing its stake in Japan Marine United, while Mitsui E&S has gradually scaled back operations, closing its Chiba yard and transferring most newbuilding activities to Tsuneishi. Similarly, Sasebo Heavy Industries exited newbuilding in 2022, shifting focus to repairs and machinery.

However, structural challenges persist. “Limited coastal space restricts new shipyard expansion, though upgrade investments aim to increase capacity at existing facilities,” Mr Tagoulis highlighted.

Additionally, an ageing workforce has prompted the industry to recruit foreign workers, who now comprise roughly 20% of the workforce, up from virtually zero a decade ago, Intermodal data shows. Specialised training centres have also been established to support skills development.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/174/Oshim1_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:00:21.674793

According to a LinkedIn post by Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, in October, 30 new vessel orders were added to the database, with LNG-fuelled ships dominating the tally. Of these, 26 were container vessels powered by LNG, while the remaining four vessels were methanol-fuelled, three of which are tankers. Year-to-date, 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in 2025.

LNG-fuelled vessels account for roughly two-thirds (67%) of these, while container ships represent 65% of the total. Although these figures represent a noticeable decline from the same period in 2024, down 52%, DNV attributes this largely to a weakening in the wider newbuild market rather than a shift away from alternative fuels.

The October orderbook also saw the addition of four LNG bunker vessels and two methanol-capable bunker vessels, highlighting ongoing investment in fuel infrastructure.

It is encouraging to see that despite persistent regulatory uncertainty, the transition to cleaner fuels continues to be firmly on the agenda. These new orders demonstrate sustained momentum in the maritime sector’s shift toward lower-emission shipping solutions

“We analysed the vessel’s operational profile, defined goals and the constraints of implementing new technology,” Mr Scheid explained.
Sofar’s Mr Rong said dynamic route optimisation results in around 5-8% fuel savings on average per vessel and voyage.
“High-quality vessel models, weather forecasts and optimised waypoint suggestions means Wayfinder helps reduce fuel and emissions during voyages,” said Mr Rong.
These modelling programs and expert insight will help owners “get through dark forests of technologies,” said Mr Rong.","Mr Scheid spoke about retrofitting vessels with technologies in a phased scheme to reduce fuel consumption and emissions and to remain compliant with EU and IMO environmental regulations. These solutions require capital expenditure with months or years before seeing a return on investment (RoI), which should be shared between owner and charterer.

“Decarbonisation is a burden on shipping, but it is also an opportunity to save money,” Mr Scheid said.

There are several challenges to decarbonisation compliance, including finding the most suitable products for ships in a fleet with different operational performance, trading patterns and commercial arrangements.

“There are dozens of technologies to reduce CO2, but not all will be applicable to all vessel types and many are new and untested,” said Mr Scheid. “When there is pressure on compliance, waiting is not an option as it increases risk and costs.”

Mr Scheid gave a case study involving a shipmanager seeking to upgrade a Kamsarmax bulk carrier to improve its carbon intensity index (CII) rating into the mid-2030s.

“We can act like a lighthouse, showing a clear path through the decarbonisation storm”

Without applying technology, this 82,000-dwt ship would have slipped into a CII D rating in 2027 and an E rating in 2029, resulting in the owner having to scrap it seven years earlier than anticipated.

Glo Marine analysed the available technologies, simulating their impact on CII and emissions, and provided the shipmanager with a three-phased approach to keeping this 230-m ship compliant until 2035.

“We analysed the vessel’s operational profile, defined goals and the constraints of implementing new technology,” Mr Scheid explained. “We shortlisted the most promising technologies and engaged around 20 manufacturers for vessel-specific changes and performance expectations.”

Glo Marine recommended the first phase of investment in 2026 to be installing ultrasound hull and propeller protection and a propeller boss cap, at a cost of around US$460,000 to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with RoI in 14 months. The next phase in 2029 willl see ducts and fins installed on the propulsion system at US$200,000, with nine months cost recovery. A third phase in 2031 includes installing a US$1.4M air-lubrication system on the hull to reduce friction and fuel consumption, which could take two years RoI, but extend the ship’s C-rating to 2033 and commercial life to 2035.

“We can act like a lighthouse, showing a clear path through the decarbonisation storm, and provide a road map for existing vessels,” said Mr Scheid. “Owners can spread costs, so it is not all at once, to gain peace of mind for compliance and extend the lifetime of vessels.”

Weather routeing

Voyage optimisation and weather routeing can enable shipowners and operators to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with far less cost.

Sofar’s Mr Rong said dynamic route optimisation results in around 5-8% fuel savings on average per vessel and voyage. The company has deployed thousands of ocean sensors for more than 75% global coverage to produce weather forecasts and provide intelligence on sea conditions.

“High-quality vessel models, weather forecasts and optimised waypoint suggestions means Wayfinder helps reduce fuel and emissions during voyages,” said Mr Rong.

Weather routeing can be integrated with other decarbonisation technologies such as wind-assisted propulsion.

“We can optimise routes in real-time,” said Mr Rong. “When sails are added, this changes the dynamics of where to sail the ship, so they ride the weather and waves of storms.”

By optimising routes for ships with rotor, wing or suction sails, owners and operators can save a considerable amount of fuel, said Mr Rong.

“Over time, we can identify and develop a breakdown of fuel savings, which can be as high as 20% on certain days, depending on wind and sea conditions.”

Before owners invest in sails, they can use voyage optimisation software to simulate routes as if they had sails and determine the future benefits. These modelling programs and expert insight will help owners “get through dark forests of technologies,” said Mr Rong.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/Juice_carrier_with_Bound4blue_rotor_sails_on_board1_Thumb.png,N,,2025-11-03 07:56:15.142656

Revised Timeline for the Net-Zero Framework

Based on the decision reached during the MEPC/ES.2 session in October 2025, the NZF timeline has shifted as follows:

Reconsideration and Approval: The framework will now be reconsidered for formal adoption at the next Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session scheduled for October 2026.

Earliest Entry-into-Force Date: Due to the procedural timelines under the IMO’s tacit-acceptance system, the earliest feasible entry-into-force date for the NZF is now 1 March 2028.

This delay reflects a strategic recalibration of the industry’s decarbonization trajectory and pushes back the timeline for introducing the NZF’s core economic mechanism.

Ongoing Regulatory Obligations

Despite the postponement of the NZF’s adoption, the following regulations and strategy remain in effect:

IMO 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy: The sector remains committed to the goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050.

Existing Efficiency Regulations: Compliance remains mandatory for the in-force efficiency and data-reporting regulations, which form the technical foundation for the future NZF:

Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI)

Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)

Data Collection System (DCS)

Shipping companies must continue to maintain accurate fuel-consumption and emissions records, as this verified data will be critical for establishing credible baselines once the NZF’s pricing and compliance obligations are eventually introduced.

Following a week of intensive consultations, most IMO member states agreed to delay the process, pushing final decisions to next year.

The framework will define the policies and tools needed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, providing shipowners and investors with greater clarity on the path toward cleaner energy.

According to the Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC), while the postponement slows the final outcome, it offers valuable time to build wider consensus and design practical, evidence-based solutions for a balanced and realistic transition.

The Chamber said this period should be used constructively, with Cyprus continuing its active engagement in international discussions under the IMO.

Cyprus, home to one of the world’s leading shipping registries and a key contributor to the national economy, stresses the importance of a unified global regulatory framework.

The absence of such a mechanism, it noted, risks creating fragmentation and regional discrepancies, potentially driving up costs and undermining competitiveness.

Recent data show that most international shipping companies are already preparing to meet the IMO’s net-zero targets, though many still face challenges in financing and implementing new green technologies.

In parallel, the European Union continues to back a global regime that ensures consistency across regions and prevents market distortions.

However, the recent talks drew criticism from industry representatives, with ICS Secretary General Thomas Kazakos voicing disappointment over the delay and calling for more decisive progress towards a clear decarbonisation pathway.

Greece and Cyprus had earlier sought compromise solutions to balance competitiveness with green innovation ahead of the IMO meeting.

The decision has already caused a slowdown in new green vessel orders, as investors await clearer direction from the IMO before committing to large-scale projects.

“Our negotiators had never seen this before in any international talks,” said one European official, who had spoken to negotiators.
The International Maritime Organization is a U.N. agency that regulates the world’s shipping industry; measures taken there are enforced by its 176 member states — almost every nation on Earth with a coastline.
The threats were not limited to European delegations, according to officials and attendees briefed on the events in London.
In at least one case U.S delegates approached another delegation on the floor of the plenary and issued a similar set of ultimatums.","European negotiators were personally targeted by their American counterparts during a brutal negotiation over green shipping rules, European Commission officials told POLITICO — a highly unusual gambit that left diplomats shaken after the meeting.

The threats were made last month, as the U.S. maneuvered to block a new effort to tax pollution at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London.

Eight envoys, officials and civil society observers from Europe, granted anonymity to describe the fractious closed-door discussions and protect their relationships with those involved, confirmed national delegates had reported they had been threatened with personal consequences if they went against Washington.

“Our negotiators had never seen this before in any international talks,” said one European official, who had spoken to negotiators. “People being summoned to the U.S. Embassy in London — intimidation, threats of cessation of business, threats of family members losing visas.”

Another European Commission official added that diplomats returned home rattled after the meetings: “We had feedback from a number of people involved in the negotiations about the pressure they faced.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, the administration has sought to undermine global climate policy and promote U.S. fossil fuel interests. The president has called efforts to combat global warming a “con job.” He was particularly enraged about the maritime emissions effort, saying it would hit American shippers with unwarranted taxes.

The International Maritime Organization is a U.N. agency that regulates the world’s shipping industry; measures taken there are enforced by its 176 member states — almost every nation on Earth with a coastline. The EU is not a member, but the European Commission and the vast majority of EU countries had been an early supporter of the carbon tax measure.

The U.S. strategy was laid out publicly ahead of the meeting, with a press release signed by the U.S. secretaries of state, transportation and energy. On top of threats of tariffs, port fees and visa restrictions on crews, the U.S. said it would also look at “sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

Only two EU members broke from the bloc: major maritime countries Cyprus and Greece, with the latter claiming its choice had nothing to do with U.S. pressure.

“We had made up our minds way before the U.S. became involved in this and we had actually voiced our concerns,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country has one of the world’s largest maritime industries, told POLITICO in an interview after Athens switched its vote and backed a postponement. “I want to be very clear … I did not speak to President Trump about this.”

The new normal

The deployment of personal threats in an international negotiation represents another departure by the Trump administration from diplomatic norms and signals further tension in relations between the U.S. and EU.

The threats were not limited to European delegations, according to officials and attendees briefed on the events in London.

“I’m directly aware of threats being made to EU countries, island states,” said one observer from a civil society group, who was briefed on the matter by a delegation.

Delegates exposed to the intimidation campaign were unwilling to speak on the record for fear the U.S. would make good on its ultimatums. The Financial Times first reported the personal threats to delegates.

In a close vote, the summit chose to delay the emissions tax for a year — a feat viewed by many as a near-death blow to the measure and a major victory for Trump. Dozens of countries from Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia agreed to the delay.

Other officials who spoke to the delegates said they were astonished at how strongly the Americans were prepared to pressure delegations.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had personally called more than 20 countries to pressure them. A senior Western diplomat confirmed the U.S. threatened Caribbean countries with tariffs if they did not agree to postpone the shipping emissions decision.

During the week-long IMO meeting, the “process was ongoing,” said the observer. In at least one case U.S delegates approached another delegation on the floor of the plenary and issued a similar set of ultimatums. “There was quite a bit of upset among the delegates.”

At a coffee break during the meeting, Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu told POLITICO that other island nations had been subjected to “relentless pressure” from the U.S.. “There’s bullshit going on,” he said.

Although tough tactics are nothing new in international talks, the bare-knuckle approach of the U.S. in London was seen as extraordinary.

“U.S. pressure created an atmosphere of fear, which in turn created chaos that ultimately led to the adoption to be delayed,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in climate and maritime transport policies at the University of Melbourne, who was present at the talks in an observer capacity.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/03/GettyImages-2240532434-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-11-03 02:56:07.679092

The episode has raised concerns about the US’s willingness to flout established diplomatic norms in international climate negotiations.","Officials from the Trump administration reportedly used aggressive tactics to prevent the adoption of a landmark UN-backed climate agreement for global shipping, sources told the Financial Times.

According to more than ten diplomats, industry observers, and government officials present at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) talks in London last month, US negotiators threatened personal and economic consequences to intimidate smaller nations into withdrawing support for the Net Zero Framework, a plan designed to impose a carbon emissions levy on shipping.

“Delegates were approached individually and warned that they and their families could face restrictions entering the United States if they acted against American interests,” one participant told the Financial Times. Another compared the pressure to “dealing with the Mob,” describing it as “bully-boy tactics” that left the usually technocratic, consensus-driven IMO in a state of shock.

The delegation reportedly targeted African nations and small Pacific and Caribbean island states, with US officials warning that countries could face additional tariffs, higher port fees, and visa restrictions if they backed the framework. The US contingent was led by a team of eight officials, according to those present.

President Donald Trump has publicly criticized the framework as a “global green new scam tax on shipping” and called for it to be blocked in social media posts. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also indicated in a pre-meeting statement that the administration was “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”

The framework, which had been provisionally agreed by a majority of countries in April, was expected to be formally adopted last month. However, its legal adoption has now been delayed for a year amid the US-led disruption.

Experts warn that such coercive tactics could have long-term consequences for US influence in global governance. Creon Butler, head of global economy at Chatham House, told the Financial Times that while the intimidation may work in the short term, “it increases the chances that non-US countries will conclude they cannot work with the US, making agreements independently among themselves which simply work around the US.”

Delegates from countries including Bangladesh, Japan, and Indonesia reported receiving formal diplomatic warnings — known as démarches — outlining potential retaliation if they supported the framework. “There was a combination of economic threats, which were reiterated on the floor, as well as very personal delegate-level threats, including threats to visas,” said one anonymous IMO participant.

Despite ongoing technical discussions, several delegates acknowledged that with Trump in the White House, the likelihood of the agreement coming into force remains slim. The episode has raised concerns about the US’s willingness to flout established diplomatic norms in international climate negotiations.

The Financial Times sources emphasized that the aggressive US approach marks a stark departure from standard multilateral diplomacy, signaling a potential erosion of trust in Washington’s commitment to global environmental agreements.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/photo_2025-01-10_21-06-24.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:56:20.689576

The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reached a new milestone on Monday (20 October).

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

The corridor partners presented their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025 on 20 October.

The report highlighted the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 metric tonnes (mt) of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realised China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol. Ports of LA and Long Beach are preparing for a methanol pilot project.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

Addressing the future of clean marine fuels due to the shifting regulatory, permitting, and policy landscape, such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Addressing market uncertainty on clean marine fuel supply and demand.

Note: For a comprehensive overview of progress and future plans, read more in the Annual Progress Report.

The recently delivered Vertom Tula is a 7,280dwt diesel-electric multipurpose cargo vessel. The solar system represents a major technical milestone and a step forward for sustainable shipping. Wattlab has delivered and installed 44 Solar Flatracks that will provide power to onboard systems, reducing 20% of the hotel load.

Vertom operates a fleet of over 100 vessels, ranging from 1,500 to 12,000dwt.

After production and assembly in September in Wattlab’s new production facilities in Rotterdam, the 44 Solar Flatracks were installed onboard within a day in the Port of Harlingen.

Bo Salet, co-founder and CEO of Wattlab, explains that the Solar Flatracks can be installed in a minimum amount of time using container twist lock fittings: “For shipowners, time is money, so speed and ease of use are important. Furthermore, we know that ‘space is money’ too. Hence, should the panels need to be removed to make way for a special type of cargo, the crew can easily stack and store them all on the footprint of one 20ft container.”

“During the pilots, the test results showed that the Solar Flatrack system performs well in the tough coastal shipping environment,” says Thomas van Meerkerk, Business Development Manager at Vertom. “Based on the results of our own and TNO’s research in the past months, we consider Wattlab’s Solar Flatrack an effective option for reducing GHG and pollutant emissions. Of course, these things also depend on the conditions our vessels operate in, but it’s clear that the system can provide both a positive ROI and contribute to CO₂ reduction in shipping.”",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-wattlab-165091.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 20:56:08.129386

Registering an Italian ship, he adds, 'is hell.","The Italian flag is losing ships entered in the register at a rate of about 3% per year, for a long time now. Launching the alarm is Confitarma, through the mouth of its director general, Luca Sisto, who recalls, and goes into detail, what the association's president, Mario Zanetti, pointed out during the last public assembly in October. In the crosshairs is the bureaucracy that makes it much more complicated and costly to register a ship in Italy, compared to other EU countries.

""The International Ship Register and the tonnage tax (an advantage that allows maritime companies to have an optional flat-rate taxation regime for ships) are the fundamental pillar for being able to sail under the Italian flag and manage the fleet from Italy. They are necessary conditions to have a national maritime industry, but they are no longer sufficient conditions. Proof of this is that, even with the international register and the tonnage tax, the Italian fleet is decreasing by about 3% a year. Why? Confitarma has identified the answer: because we have a bureaucratic apparatus for registering ships in Italy that now costs 300-400 thousand euro more per ship compared to European flags and our competitors who have administrative regimes similar or equal to those we have, that is, register and tonnage.

In effetti, guardando le tabelle messe a punto dall’ufficio studi di Confitarma, negli ultimi 15 anni, si vede che la flotta tricolore nel 2010 era ancora in espansione: contava 1.664 unità (+6% sul 2009) pari a 17,3 milioni di tonnellate di stazza lorda (+10%). Già nel 2011, però, inizia il calo: le navi scendono a 1.619 (-3%) mentre il tonnellaggio sale ancora (+8%, a 18,7 milioni: quindi meno unità ma più grandi). La situazione si ripete nel 2012 con -2% di navi (a 1.581) e +2% di tonnellate (19,1 milioni). Ma dal 2013 inizia una discesa sia del numero assoluto di scafi (-1%, a 1.564), sia del tonnellaggio (-2%, a 18,6 milioni) che non si è più fermata. Nel 2024 (ultimo dato disponibile) le navi battenti bandiera italiana sono arrivate a 1.206 (l’anno prima erano 1.237) e la stazza lorda è calata 12,5 milioni di tonnellate (erano 12,7 milioni nel 2023). Dal 2010, insomma, sono uscite dalla flotta 458 unità.

To put a stop to this downfall, 'obviously,' says Sisto, 'we need to work on all those conditions of ship management, under the Italian flag or by a company based in Italy, that are no longer in line with the competition of European and international markets. We need a national pact to simplify. And I say simplify, not deregulate; because we want rules, but we want them to be identical to those that other countries have'.

Registering an Italian ship, he adds, 'is hell. For example, if you don't do it on a Thursday but it happens on a Friday and you have to put together the permits of four administrations, you risk keeping the ship in port for three days without a flag, something that does not happen in another maritime country because you solve everything with an e-mail with a pdf file. This happens in Malta, Madeira, and Cyprus. Not in Italy, if you're abroad you have to go to a consulate that issues a provisional passport. And if the consulate is closed or perhaps has to issue visas for tourists, it doesn't even give the captain an appointment and so the ship cannot fly the flag and cannot be registered in the flag registry. It's crazy stuff that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/10/31/Immagini/Ritagli/istockphoto-1969734354-612x612-U28563870332Mnt-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.jpg?r=1170x507,N,,2025-11-02 11:01:02.891407

Summary The maritime sector is at a crucial juncture due to new greenhouse gas regulations, including the pending IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aimed at drastically reducing ship emissions. The NZF sets ambitious targets: a 20% reduction by 2030, a 70% reduction by 2040, and total decarbonization by 2050, using 2008 levels as the baseline. DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides insights on the regulatory landscape and the transition to low-GHG fuels and technologies. Stakeholders, including shipowners, must explore low-GHG fuels and technologies, emphasizing the need for infrastructure for refueling and CO2 offloading. LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and methanol are gaining prominence, while ammonia and hydrogen are in trial phases. Nearly the same number of alternative-fuel ships is on order compared to those currently in service, indicating a shift in the fleet’s capabilities. The forecast predicts that alternative fuel consumption could approach 50 Mtoe by 2030, with LNG leading the way. A significant workforce training initiative is required, with an estimated 33,000 seafarers needing alternative fuel training in the next few years. Wind propulsion technologies are being integrated into the fleet with increasing interest and regulatory support. The article discusses barriers to low-GHG fuel adoption, including technology, demand, costs, and fuel availability. Enhanced Chain of Custody models can facilitate the verification and tracing of low-GHG fuel, which may support market growth. Maritime forecast models suggest the establishment of CO2 offloading infrastructure could match the impact of using low-GHG fuels, stressing the need for early engagement with CO2 storage projects. Shipowners are encouraged to adopt proactive, case-by-case strategies to navigate the new regulatory environment and manage compliance risks",https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/c45fy346jw096z9pbphyyhdz7,N,,2025-11-02 03:56:07.682745

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

It is incredibly disappointing that we are on day thirty-one of the Democrats’ reckless government shutdown, and that Senate Democrats have officially voted thirteen times to keep the government closed. This week, I was back in Washington, advocating against this reckless shutdown, which hit a month today. As a result of the Democrats’ refusal to reopen the government, federal employees did not receive paychecks today, and tomorrow, SNAP benefits run out for the millions of vulnerable Americans who rely on them. I am infuriated by this. Please see below for a list of resources available to individuals impacted by this shutdown.

Best,

SNAP Resources for Texas-11

3.5 million vulnerable Texans will, unfortunately, stop receiving SNAP benefits tomorrow because Democrats refuse to reopen the government. It pains me that many people who rely on these benefits will not receive the critical support they need. I voted to fund the government, including SNAP, to avoid this very situation. I am infuriated that Democrats continue to put their political agenda before the well-being of Americans in need. I urge Senate Democrats to do the right thing and stop holding the government hostage. In the meantime, please reach out to my office if you are negatively affected by this shutdown and need assistance.

The Modern-Day Democrat Party is Not the Party of JFK

As we officially reach one month of the Democrats’ government shutdown, I was back in Washington, D.C. this week to join Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, GOP Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, and several of my Republican Study Committee colleagues for the daily House Leadership press conference on Capitol Hill.

During the press conference, I called out Democrats for using struggling American families as political leverage and pointed out how today’s Democrat Party has drifted far from the ideals and policies of John F. Kennedy, who once famously said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” Today’s Democrats have turned that on its head, saying: “Ask not what you can do for your country, but WHO you can leverage for your radical agenda.”

I also stood up for our service members and military families, many of whom are being directly impacted by the shutdown. With Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo and Fort Hood in Killeen, I am fighting to ensure our troops, their families, and federal workers are supported during this time.

House Republicans did our job weeks ago by voting to fund the government with a simple, clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution. It’s time for Democrats to do the right thing and end this senseless shutdown. Watch my full remarks from the press conference here or by clicking the image below.

Jack Smith’s Partisan ‘Arctic Frost’ Investigation

Jack Smith’s ‘Arctic Frost’ investigation into President Trump, Republican lawmakers, and conservative groups has turned out to be exactly what we expected: an unconstitutional political witch hunt. The weaponization of our nation’s top law enforcement agency to target political opponents is unacceptable, especially in the United States.

This is exactly why I joined my colleague Congressman Brecheen (OK-02) in calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a criminal investigation into Jack Smith and every single Biden-era DOJ bureaucrat who attempted to subvert the rule of law and violate the constitutional rights of the American people. I also share the serious concerns of many of my colleagues regarding Judge James Boasberg and fully support an investigation into his involvement. These individuals must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law – and we will ensure this kind of blatant corruption never happens again.

RSC Podcast with Special Guests Speaker Johnson and Majority Leader Scalise

I had a fantastic time hosting the Republican Study Committee’s Podcast ‘Right to the Point’ featuring special guests House Speaker Mike Johnson (LA-04) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (LA-01). In the episode, we pointed out the reality of who the modern-day Democrats are, as they openly admit to leveraging struggling Americans to appease the radical left flank of their party.

We also made predictions on who will win the College Football National Championship, guessing if it will be the Texas A&M Aggies or the LSU Tigers. Listen to the full episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Rumble here.

Trump Administration Biosimilar Announcement

The Trump Administration announced major plans this week to accelerate and lower the cost of biosimilar development. This is a major victory in the fight to lower prescription drug prices and expand access for all Americans. As Secretary Kennedy noted, ‘Parents are facing heartbreaking choices between paying for medication or putting food on their tables. This is not acceptable in the United States of America.’ I am proud to stand with the administration on this effort.

Last month, I introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation that directly aligns with this announcement by automatically deeming all biosimilars as interchangeable upon FDA approval and eliminating the unnecessary switching studies that delay patient access. The administration has called on Congress to act, and I’m ready to deliver. We stand ready to get this done and ensure more Americans can access life-saving medications without facing financial burdens.

Odessa Chamber of Commerce in Washington

This week, I had the pleasure of attending the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards in Washington, DC, where the Odessa Chamber of Commerce was a finalist in the Best Civic Engagement Program category. Even though they did not win the title, our office is incredibly proud of their entire team for this accomplishment and recognition. Texas-11 is the best place to live, work, and raise a family, and I am grateful to represent so many amazing people dedicated to serving their communities.

UNtaxed Act

Today, I introduced the UNtaxed Act alongside several of my colleagues on the Republican Study Committee to prevent the United Nations (UN) from ever implementing a global carbon tax. This comes in response to the fact that earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was scheduled to adopt a “net zero framework” for the international shipping industry. This is a de facto global carbon tax on emissions and could increase global shipping costs by 10% or more.

I am proud to lead this effort to ensure that the UN has no legal authority to impose taxes on American citizens or companies. I also penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner making the case for the UNtaxed Act. Read it here or by clicking on the image below.

American Cattle Ranchers are the Backbone of Food Security

I remain fully committed to supporting American agriculture and the hard-working men and women who keep our food supply strong. This week, I met with leaders from the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, and I spoke with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the reports of potential beef imports from Argentina. My stance hasn’t changed: American cattle ranchers are the backbone of our food security and a cornerstone of our economy, and we must support them. They work tirelessly to provide the highest quality beef for American families. Today’s higher prices are a result of strong demand, not a shortage of supply, and importing foreign beef would only discourage U.S. ranchers from expanding their herds and investing in domestic production.

Bringing in beef from countries with checkered animal health records also risks the integrity of our domestic herds and undermines the gold-standard health and safety practices upheld by American producers.

Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

Proactive: Peter, very good to speak with you. The International Maritime Organization's delayed adopting its net zero framework for another year. What's your reaction to that decision and what does it mean for the pace of shipping's decarbonisation?

Peter Borup: There's no doubt it is adding uncertainty to the path forward — not just the exact fuel that shipping will focus on in the future, but also the whole decision-making process. That being said, the three major alternatives for shipping fuel in the future have been methanol, ammonia, and people have also talked about nuclear — all three fuels that are not readily distributable now. They all come with a certain question mark. So it's not an imminent fix.

I think overall, it's a little bit hard to tell whether this is good or bad for a company like Quadrise. But the uncertainty suggests that shipowners need to find a way of taking agency themselves. There are a number of technologies out there that they can look to — everything from rotor sails to blowing bubbles along the hull, to changing the paint used on the hull — that can easily offer 7% or 8% fuel savings. Or they can use our products — the Quadrise family of MSAR and bioMSAR — which also offer significant reductions in emissions and cost savings.

For me, the thing is that we may not have the perfect fuel yet, but if you're combining some of these technologies, the effect is cumulative. You can actually go pretty far and save money at the same time. So there's more confusion now, yes, but I do think that shipowners can still do a lot themselves while regulators figure things out.

Proactive: I wanted to ask about your fuels, Peter, because with no global carbon pricing mechanism in place until at least 2027, how does that uncertainty affect the commercial rollout of cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR?

Peter Borup: It's hard to say. I think it's more of a sentiment shift, if anything, that could affect it. Fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR offer cost savings compared to regular fuels and reduce emissions. So from that perspective, they are on fairly safe ground. I don't think it should be affected much.

There are already operational regulations in place — the EU is probably the most well known. Traditionally, many of the fuels have been appealing mostly to liner companies, or ships on a regular service, where you can build up distribution. But some of the content in the EU rules — the EU Emissions Trading Scheme — actually offers a tertiary market to asset players, traders, and operators.

They would take positions in physical markets and freight derivatives, and now they can also participate in the ETS. There are already players selling credits on the biofuels they’re using, having saved CO2 emissions compared to regular operations — selling them at more than €300 per tonne to big players like Microsoft.

So that market is there, and that still means many of these technologies remain very attractive to a wider audience.

Proactive: Do you think the delay could actually play in your favour? Some in the industry worry it could slow investment in new fuels. Does that create more short-term opportunities for transitional solutions like yours?

Peter Borup: I'm not sure. It really depends on how the shipping world reacts. I don't see it as a risk. I don't think this is clearly bad for us. It could be in our favour. But it also depends on how quickly we can have the fuels adopted. That is probably more important. I'm aware there's a window here — I think it's fairly broad — but the earlier we have adoption, the more good we can do.

Proactive: Your sense from attending that IMO meeting — how important is regulatory clarity for your customers and partners when deciding whether to switch from conventional heavy fuel oil to your lower emission alternatives?

Peter Borup: I didn't actually participate in it, but I followed it closely. What's really important for our clients — shipowners — is that there is a level playing field. That's also why the EU introduced their rules. Initially, it wasn't necessarily because they wanted to regulate, but because there was an absence of global regulation through the IMO.

That's one of the biggest fears of shipowners — having to comply with different regulatory frameworks depending on where they are in the world, and knowing there may be competitors who don’t have to comply with stricter rules. That could be in the EU or somewhere else. So the need for a level playing field remains — and probably only the IMO can provide that.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDIxLTExLTI2LTA4LTE0LTA2LWUxMmY0MDNkMDRiMjdhZjU1MGVmMzM2ODZlZjU0MmNiLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:11.534114

The collaboration brings together the capabilities of companies from the maritime, shipbuilding, and clean technology sectors to accelerate the demonstration and commercialization of carbon-free ship solutions.

Under the collaboration, the partners will jointly conduct concept design for next-generation propulsion systems — including an integrated solution combining an ammonia-based gas turbine and fuel cells for 7,000–8,000 TEU-class container vessels, and a hybrid system combining fuel cell and battery technologies for 2,000 TEU-class feeder vessels — while evaluating their commercial feasibility and developing new vessel concepts optimized for these solutions.

“The integrated propulsion system that combines fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines will set a new standard for maritime decarbonization,” said Hyoung-seog Kim, Head of maritime solutions business division at Hanwha Power Systems. “We will continue to expand collaboration with shipowners, shipyards, and classification societies to apply our technology to actual vessels as soon as possible and advance toward commercial operations.”

“This collaboration represents a strategic partnership to respond to the global shift toward decarbonization,” added Min-kang Kim, Head of maritime office at HMM. “Through demonstration and commercialization, we will accelerate the transition to a future eco-friendly fleet.”

“This project is an exemplary cooperation model in which the shipping, shipbuilding, and classification sectors establish safety and regulatory standards together from the early research stage,” said Kyu-jin Yeon, Senior vice president of KR. “It will contribute to establishing an international eco-friendly certification system.”

The collaboration builds on Hanwha Power Systems’ recent Approval in Principle (AiP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for the retrofit of 174K LNG carriers with ammonia gas turbine propulsion systems. The MOU is expected to further accelerate the commercialization of a fully carbon-free propulsion system combining fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines.

The MOU serves as a collaborative model that combines Hanwha Group’s technological strength, HMM’s expertise in vessel operation, and KR’s technical verification framework to create synergy across the shipbuilding and shipping industries. Each company will contribute according to its area of expertise. Hanwha Group will lead integrated propulsion development. HMM will support performance validation using operational data. KR will carry out early-stage risk and safety assessments, provide AiP consulting, review regulatory and certification requirements, and conduct economic analyses.

The collaboration aims to disseminate zero-carbon propulsion technologies that align with the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal. Hanwha Group, HMM, and KR plan to continue their partnership based on demonstration outcomes, working to expand zero-carbon propulsion solutions and strengthen the global competitiveness of the shipping and shipbuilding industries.

Rising dependence on fossil fuels due to increased power demand from artificial intelligence and to geopolitical tensions have led to 2050 net zero goals becoming unattainable, Wood Mackenzie said in its Energy Transition Outlook report.
In China, oil demand stood at 16 million bpd in 2025, but rising electric vehicle adoption could lead to demand falling by 35% by 2060, the report said.

Rising dependence on fossil fuels due to increased power demand from artificial intelligence and to geopolitical tensions have led to 2050 net zero goals becoming unattainable, Wood Mackenzie said in its Energy Transition Outlook report.

The report comes ahead of the COP30 meeting in Brazil next month where countries are due to present updated national climate commitments and assess progress on renewable energy targets.

Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is expected to peak at 108 million barrels per day in 2032 with natural gas demand remaining resilient well into the 2040s, the report said.

In China, oil demand stood at 16 million bpd in 2025, but rising electric vehicle adoption could lead to demand falling by 35% by 2060, the report said. However, India, Southeast Asia and Africa remain key drivers of oil demand growth.

A Wood Mackenzie analysis suggests that limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would require $4.3 trillion in annual investment between 2025-2060 – an increase of 30% from current levels – to reach net zero emissions by around 2060.

Energy sector investment would therefore need to grow from 2.5% of global GDP today to 3.35% within the next decade.

“Fossil fuels are no longer uncontested; they are being squeezed into narrower roles, but their decline is proving more gradual than expected,” the Wood Mackenzie report said.

Displacing fossil fuels with renewable power is a pillar of the energy transition that seeks to meet the Paris Agreement target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 C (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels.",,N,,2025-11-01 04:59:54.713714

The feasibility study, produced in collaboration with a consortium created in 2023 (which includes Anglo American, CMB.TECH, Freeport Saldanha, VUKA Marine, and ENGIE), said the corridor linking Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands would be one of the first Global South-to-North green shipping routes.

Saldanha Bay, home to South Africa’s primary iron-ore export terminal, is already planning the development of ammonia production, alongside port upgrades to handle bunkering operations.

In the green corridor’s initial years, ammonia-fueled vessels would likely bunker in Rotterdam, which is one of the most mature ports in terms of its ammonia bunkering and safety frameworks. Meanwhile, Saldanha Bay will have the opportunity to build the infrastructure to become the long-term green ammonia production and bunkering hub for the corridor.

By 2035, the port could supply bunkering services to all corridor vessels locally, creating a dual-purpose facility that continues mineral exports while serving international shipping.

“This phased approach gives shipowners and fuel producers a clear timeline to work toward, and we now need coordinated action from policymakers and industry to make this a reality by 2029,” said Shanon Neumann, Associate: Investment Facilitation at Freeport Saldanha. “However, to help Saldanha Bay transition quickly, blending public and private funding can unlock investment in infrastructure and reduce the risks of early projects.”

Why it matters for South Africa

The World Bank and World Economic Forum have both previously identified South Africa as a prospective key player in fueling shipping’s decarbonisation. The green corridor could contribute towards turning this notion into a reality.

Announced green hydrogen projects near the ports of Boegoebaai, Saldanha, and Walvis Bay could meet the corridor’s fuel needs, including its high-demand scenario of 22 bulk carriers per annum by 2035. The possibility of such strong demand levels could mean a stronger business case for green hydrogen producers looking to secure enough offtake volumes to finalise investment decisions and accelerate new projects.

Add in the necessary financing, potential tax incentives, and port tariff discounts for fuel production and bunkering build-out at Freeport Saldanha, and South Africa could gain a competitive edge as an international bunker supplier. The country’s hydrogen sector may be able to contribute 3.6% to the country’s GDP by 2030, with shipping and steel well-positioned to become early offtakers of the gas and its derivatives.

This green shipping corridor offers the opportunity to strengthen South Africa’s export competitiveness, future-proof a strategic port, and support the country’s Just Energy Transition through local value chains, skills development, and community benefits.

Policy alignment equals a strong business case

Regional and global regulations could materially improve the business case for the corridor. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime greenhouse-gas intensity targets and Emissions Trading System levy, the latter to be fully phased in by 2026, narrow the cost gap between green ammonia and conventional fuels by more than 60% in modelled scenarios.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), now set to be revisited in 2026 following the decision earlier this month to delay adoption, would further strengthen the case, with fuel standards, emissions targets, and market-based incentives that reward zero-emission fuels.

“With binding global regulations delayed for now, there remains a business case to be made for green ammonia on this corridor,” says Marieke Beckmann, Global Maritime Forum deputy director of decarbonisation. “The role of national and local governments becomes increasingly important in incentivising the adoption of scalable zero-emission fuels. This, combined with EU measures, will help position South Africa as a competitive supplier of clean maritime fuel,” she said.

Next step: Implementation

The Global Maritime Forum study provides a roadmap to making the corridor operational by 2029, including:

• Creating an enabling contracting environment to optimally and fairly allocate risks and rewards across the value chain.

• Engaging with South African government bodies and industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the corridor opportunity and the need for an enabling policy environment, and build momentum around it.

• Mobilising funding and incentives for corridor infrastructure that will contribute to Saldanha’s hydrogen hub and port development.

If implemented, the South Africa–Europe Iron Ore Green Corridor could become a model for an equitable, commercially viable zero-emission shipping corridor and a catalyst for South Africa’s hydrogen economy to unlock large-scale investment.",https://biz-file.com/c/2510/793116-1200x624.png?2,N,,2025-10-31 20:00:37.731159

California: CARB postpones rulemaking for SBs 253 and 261, but not the reporting deadlines. The California Air Resources Board (CARB announced on October 14 that it will postpone its initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for California’s landmark climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, to Q1 2026. Of note: the delay does not change the initial reporting deadlines required under both measures. Disclosures under SB 261, Climate-Related Financial Risk, are still due on January 1, 2026. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, still must draw on FY 2025 data. CARB stated that the delays in issuing the rulemaking arise from the “large volume of public comments” it received during its August workshop for stakeholders and that is also working to refine the Preliminary List of Reporting/Covered Entities released in September, which set out specific companies that may be subject to SB 261 and SB 253. Also on October 14, CARB released a more simplified draft reporting template for Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253. For the first reporting cycle, use of the template will be voluntary.

EU: Omnibus I in the news. The EU continues to work through Omnibus I, the set of proposed simplification measures that will streamline key reporting and compliance requirements of the bloc’s Green Deal: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Green Taxonomy, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Here are the latest developments:

On September 29, the European Council formally adopted simplifying changes to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that had been overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament on September 10. As we reported last month, chief among the amendments is a new de minimis threshold under which imports of up to 50 metric tons per importer per year will not be subject to CBAM rules. This change effectively exempts 90 percent of importers from CBAM’s rules. Notably, the overarching climate ambition behind the mechanism remains unchanged: 99 percent of total CO2 emissions from imports of iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and fertilizers will still be covered by the CBAM.

Last month, we reported that the European Commission was considering another 12-month postponement of the due diligence obligations in the EUDR. On October 21, the Commission released its proposed amendments to the EUDR which, notably, preserve the current due date, December 30, 2025, for large and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission is also proposing to allow such enterprises a six-month grace period. The proposed amendments include several other key changes. Upstream entities – those introducing a commodity into the bloc’s market – would still need to provide due diligence reports, but downstream entities – which leverage commodities already on the EU market – would not. To further lighten overall reporting requirements, micro and small primary operators from low-risk countries – which, the Commission stated, include most of the bloc’s foresters and farmers – would each need to submit just one simple declaration in the EUDR Information System. And micro and small operators would have until December 30, 2026 to comply, rather than the current due date of June 30, 2026. Next, before the amendments can be formally adopted, the European Parliament and Council must consider them. The Commission called for the amendments to be adopted by December 30, 2025.

On October 22, the European Parliament rejected proposed amendments to due diligence and sustainability disclosure rules in the CSRD, CSDDD, and the EU Green Taxonomy. The rejected proposal was a compromise measure submitted to Parliament on October 13 by the EU’s Legal Affairs Committee (also called the JURI Committee) that would deeply slash the number of in-scope companies required to report. JURI’s proposal was defeated narrowly, 318 to 309, with 34 abstentions. Next, the Omnibus I initiative goes back to Parliament for renewed negotiations; a parliamentary vote on any new proposals is slated for November 13. Negotiations among the Commission, Parliament, and Council can only take place after Parliament finalizes its position.

Going forward, in Q4 we may expect additional omnibus initiatives, not least a planned Environmental Omnibus which would affect the Waste Framework Directive, Net Zero Industry Act, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) rules.

US, Qatar express “deep concern” to EU leaders about CSDDD. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Qatari Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi have sent a joint letter to the leaders of EU member states to express their “deep concern” about the impact of the CSDDD – in particular, “its unintended consequences for LNG [liquified natural gas] export competitiveness and the availability of reliable, affordable energy for EU consumers.” In the undated letter, Wright and Al-Kaabi state, “We have consistently and transparently communicated how the CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy.” None of the proposed revisions to the CSDDD currently under consideration, they continue, has properly addressed their concerns. Wright and Al-Kaabi’s letter concludes with a call for EU leaders to “take immediate decisive action by reopening substantive dialogue with your global partners, including the United States and Qatar and the wider international business community.”

PwC Global Sustainability Reporting Survey: Pressure is rising to report on sustainability, but reporting brings value, too. A study from multinational accounting firm PwC concludes that, despite political uncertainties around climate-related due diligence, sustainability is increasingly important to a company’s performance. The inaugural Global Sustainability Reporting Survey asked 496 companies about their approach to reporting under such regimes as the CSRD or the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). First, PwC found, despite likely postponements coming in the EU under the Omnibus I simplification initiative, 40 percent of respondents said they plan to hold to the original CSRD reporting schedule, even if the EU alters its compliance requirements. More largely, many reported to PwC that pressure from investors, governments, and the marketplace is prompting them to accelerate their disclosures of sustainability risks and opportunities. Furthermore, about 70 percent of respondents said that sustainability reporting brings their company moderate to significant benefits that extend beyond compliance, helping inform their strategic moves in such areas as risk management, the supply chain, and investments. The study concludes, “Changes of direction this year by regulators have, without a doubt, slowed the momentum towards statutory sustainability reporting. But the overall trend to increase reporting remains unchanged.” Read PwC’s Global Sustainability Reporting Survey here.

Greenwashing

District court approves Rust-Oleum greenwashing settlement. The US District Court for the Northern District of California finally approved a $1.5 million settlement to a class of Rust-Oleum consumers who charged that the company’s ""non-toxic"" and ""Earth Friendly"" claims for its Krud Kutter cleaning products over an approximately 10-year period were false and misleading. The court’s order, issued on October 2, requires Rust-Oleum to remove “non-toxic” claims from its products’ labels and “add an asterisk to the 'Earth Friendly' representation on the products' front labels to direct consumers to the back label where it will state: 'Contains no inorganic phosphates, hazardous solvents, or environmentally harmful surfactants,' or similar qualifying language.” In addition to the payment to the class, the court also awarded class counsel $500,000 in fees and over $280,000 in costs. The case, brought in 2020, alleged that Rust-Oleum’s stain remover and degreaser products included potentially harmful chemicals like alcohol ethoxylates and sodium metasilicate and asserted violations of California consumer protection statutes, such as false advertising statutes, as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The parties reached the settlement after the court denied Rust-Oleum’s motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. With the settlement, Rust-Oleum does not admit liability or wrongdoing.

Company charges that a competitor is greenwashing a product line. Moldex-Metric, a manufacturer of respiratory and hearing protection products, has sued competitor Protective Industrial Products, charging that Protective’s claims about the environmental benefits of its BioSoft earplugs are “a calculated ‘greenwashing’ scheme to capture market share” via “unqualified environmental benefit claims.” In its complaint, Moldex lists a number of Protective’s marketing statements about the products, among them that they are eco-friendly, “decompose 76% in 180 days,” and are the world’s first sustainable bio-based ear plug. Moldex next stated that, in seeking to confirm Protective’s claims, its numerous requests – first, that Protective substantiate its marketing and, subsequently, that it correct its inaccurate statements – changed nothing. Protective, the complaint states, “has failed to timely remove or correct its false and misleading environmental claims, instead choosing to continue deliberately deceiving consumers.” Moldex is calling on the court to rule that Protective has competed unfairly under the Lanham Act and the California Business and Professions Code, to enjoin Protective from any further act of unfair competition, and to require the company to issue corrective advertising. The suit, still in its earliest stages, was brought in the District Court for the Central District of California.

France: historic ruling in TotalEnergies écoblanchiment case. On October 23, in a highly anticipated ruling, the Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris found that TotalEnergies SE and TotalEnergies Électricité et Gaz France misled consumers in a 2021 ad campaign claiming TotalEnergies could become carbon neutral by 2050. Specifically, TotalEnergies claimed that it put “climate at the heart of its strategy, with the aim of providing cleaner, safer and more affordable energy to as many people as possible” and that it had set the ambition to achieve “net zero” by 2050. The tribunal ordered the company to remove claims on the TotalEnergies SE website stating that sustainable development is at the heart of its business strategy and that, in line with United Nations development goals, it contributes to the well-being of populations. Écoblanchiment – greenwashing – is not explicitly addressed in French law, so charges were brought under French laws governing “pratiques commerciales trompeuses” – misleading social practices. This is the first time these French laws have been brought against a fossil fuel company, and the first time that any court in the world has held a fossil fuel company responsible for greenwashing. Notwithstanding this landmark ruling, the tribunal notably dismissed most of the claims that had been brought against TotalEnergies, including those related to its advertising campaign around its name change and generally promoting natural gas and biofuels as not sufficiently connected to the sale of products to consumers and thus outside the scope of consumer law. The company has a month from the date of the ruling to remove the implicated statements and post the tribunal’s ruling on the TotalEnergies SE website; it remains to be seen whether the ruling has a knock-on effect on other fossil fuel marketing campaigns across Europe. In September 2024, South Africa’s Advertising Regulatory Board ruled that a TotalEnergies social media campaign, #FuelYourExperience, was misleading, marking that country’s first decision on corporate greenwashing.

German court orders shoe retailer to withdraw sustainability claims. A German regional court has ruled that Germany-based Deichmann, the leading European footwear retailer, is guilty of making false advertising claims about the sustainability of some of its products. This case was brought by Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), an environmental and consumer protection organization, which charged that the retailer had advertised hundreds of its shoes as sustainable, using the slogan “Sustainability: Yes,” without providing any verifiable evidence to substantiate that claim. During the trial, Deichmann compared the shoes in question to similar products from competitors to demonstrate that the advertised shoes offered no environmental benefits. In a binding ruling issued on October 7, the Landgericht (regional court) of Bochum agreed with DUH, ordering the company to withdraw its sustainability claims and “cease its misleading advertising.”

Manx FCA issues guidance on greenwashing. The Isle of Man’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued guidance notes on greenwashing and consumer protection to help regulated entities understand and manage the implications of their sustainability-based claims. The guidance affirms that the FCA’s existing authority and current Isle of Man law “apply equally to greenwashing as to other forms of misleading or false advertising.” It sets out, then explains, five principles to help avoid making greenwashing claims, among them that claims should be correct and capable of being substantiated and entity-level claims should align with corporate strategy. The guidance is directed at entities registered under the Financial Services Act 2008, Insurance Act 2008, Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000, and Collective Investment Schemes Act 2008. While the guidance does not have the force of law, the FCA states, “it is persuasive.” The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency known for its business-friendly milieu.

Sustainability: Regulatory

EPA reverses course on coke emissions standards. In a reversal on October 3, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin signed a final rule that reinstates the original compliance deadline for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens. Coke is a key component in steelmaking. The tighter standards governing emissions from coke plants were originally slated to go into effect in July 2025, but, that month, the agency extended their compliance deadline by two years, stating that the industry could not feasibly implement them. The final rule signed by Zeldin on October 3 reinstates the original effective date. The rule establishes stricter emissions limits for emissions of such substances as mercury and requires plants that manufacture coke to install fenceline monitoring systems for releases of benzene. Also in July, the EPA extended the compliance deadline for a separate rule, Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, by two years. At this writing, it is unclear whether that postponement too will be reversed.

Deadline approaches for comments on proposed changes to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process under the TSCA. November 7 is the deadline to submit comments to the EPA on a proposed rule that would change the way the agency evaluates the risks of chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The EPA states that the proposed rule, pursuant to Executive Order 14219, “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department Of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative,” and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative, would streamline such evaluations while increasing transparency and providing a more predictable regulatory process for chemical manufacturers. The current procedural framework for evaluating the risk of chemicals is set out in a 2017 rule that was revised in 2024 to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all conditions of use (COUs). The proposed rule would revert to separate evaluations for each COU. Among other key changes in the proposed rule: the EPA would be allowed to take into account occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment, in risk determinations and chemical risk evaluations; would use the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” set out in Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science”; would eliminate “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations; and would require less information from manufacturers submitting requests for risk evaluations. See the proposed rule here.

CalRecycle: Updates on progress of EPR law. California’s Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act Advisory Board met on October 17 to discuss the implementation of SB 54, California’s EPR legislation. At the meeting, the California Department of Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) stated that it is currently focusing on rulemaking efforts, reviewing public comments, and preparing its responses. Additionally, CalRecycle stated that interim technical reports on collection, processing, and end markets; source reduction and material design; and consumer education and access will be released soon. The Circular Action Alliance (CAA) also provided an update at the meeting, reporting that it is working with several agencies to develop plans for stakeholder engagement in the EPR program. CAA urged producers to submit their 2023 data by November 15, 2025 to enable more accurate 2027 fee rate ranges and source reduction planning. Additionally, CAA noted that de minimis clarity for certain types of plastic is still pending.

CAA discusses RecycleOn Colorado EPR strategy. In an October 9 webinar, CAA laid out its “RecycleOn Colorado” education and outreach strategy under the state’s EPR law, HB 22-1355, the Producer Responsibility Program for Statewide Recycling Act. Speakers from CAA and the agencies working on the marketing campaign explained that, starting in spring 2026, RecycleOn Colorado will work to expand public awareness of the EPR program through a broad outreach program that helps residents understand and take part in the new recycling system. Among the marketing campaign’s overall goals are increasing Colorado’s recycling rate to 47 to 60 percent by 2035 and expanding curbside recycling to 500,000 new households, particularly focusing on rural areas in which recycling programs currently may not exist and residents may be skeptical. July 31 was the initial reporting deadline for covered entities under HB 22-1355, which in January 2026 will begin paying responsibility fees that will be used to establish free recycling programs for Colorado residents. The longer-term plan is to bring small businesses into the recycling program by 2030. For more information, see our latest state EPR law roundup.

Quebec’s Bill 29, addressing planned obsolescence in consumer goods, is now in effect. Quebec’s new durable goods law, the Act to protect consumers from planned obsolescence and to promote the durability, repairability and maintenance of goods (Bill 29), became effective on October 5. Bill 29 introduces a right to durability, requiring manufacturers to provide a legal warranty of good working order for certain new goods, such as refrigerators, stoves, laptops, and cell phones. It also enhances the right to repairability, requiring manufacturers and merchants to warranty the availability of replacement parts and repair services for goods requiring maintenance and specifying that they must provide information about maintaining and repairing such goods. Further, the installation of replacement parts must be possible using “commonly available tools.” Find out more about Bill 29 in our alert.

IMO postpones vote on net zero framework and global pricing mechanism for ships’ carbon emissions.

The amendments – designed over years with input from all major countries – would have put in place a legally binding timetable to reduce maritime shipping emissions: a 20- to 30-percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a 70-percent reduction by 2040, and net zero “by or around” 2050. Vessels not in compliance would be required to pay fees with gradually increasing carbon-intensity targets. This framework has been broadly supported by the shipping industry because it sets out global standards that are consistent and clear.

At an IMO meeting in April, a majority of the world’s countries endorsed the amendments. The next step was for IMO members to vote on adopting the amendments during this month’s extraordinary session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London. However, in August, the US formally rejected the agreement. On October 16, it reiterated its warnings to IMO member nations that, if the net zero framework were voted in, the US would consider remedies. Ultimately, on October 17, Singapore’s motion to table the vote on the measure, put forward by Saudi Arabia and supported by Russia and the US, passed narrowly, pushing a vote on adoption to October 2026. Given the delay, the IMO is now reportedly working to revise the timelines set out in the agreement, which would have gone into effect in 2028. The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Sustainability: Litigation

Several lawsuits filed over rescission of Solar for All grants. A coalition of 22 US states and the District of Columbia have filed suit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington charging that the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin illegally revoked $7 billion in clean energy funds that had been awarded to local governments. The suit, brought on October 16, concerns the Solar for All program, created to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. Funding was appropriated by Congress for the program in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

This is just one of several cases filed this month over the Solar for All termination. On October 15, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients, led by the Maryland Clean Energy Center, state of Arizona, and California Public Utilities Commission, brought a breach of contract action in the US Court of Federal Claims over the EPA’s decision to unilaterally terminate competitive grants they had been awarded under Solar for All. On October 13, Harris County, Texas filed its own suit against the EPA, Zeldin, and EPA Award Official Devon Brown in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, charging that no act of Congress authorized the decision to cancel Solar for All and that the cancellation violates the Constitution. Finally, a separate lawsuit filed on October 6 in the US District Court for the District of Rhode Island alleges that the termination of Solar for All was unconstitutional and caused the plaintiffs harm. That suit differs from the others in that its plaintiffs are “intended beneficiaries” of Solar for All – a group of nonprofits, solar installation companies, a trade union, and a homeowner. They argue that the Executive Branch did not have the statutory authority to rescind Solar for All’s funding because, although Congress repealed large swathes of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the summer, it has not repealed the Solar for All program retroactively.

All these cases are in the earliest stages.

Iowa counties petition Supreme Court over proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. On October 3, the Iowa counties of Story and Shelby petitioned the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked them from enforcing local setback ordinances against carbon sequestration pipelines. This is the latest development in the ongoing saga of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed $9 billion Midwest Express carbon capture pipeline, which would collect captured CO2 from ethanol plants across the Midwest and sequester it in underground rock formations in North Dakota. Earlier this year, in a setback for the company, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, effectively blocking that portion of the planned route. In June, the Eighth Circuit agreed with Summit’s contention that the counties’ regulations requiring “hazardous liquid pipelines” to meet setback rules around schools, churches, and other buildings are preempted by the federal Pipeline Safety Act. The company’s struggle to obtain permits for its multistate project is continuing across other fronts. Also this month, it argued in Iowa’s Polk County District Court that, before a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club against the permit itself moves forward, the company’s proposed changes to its Iowa Utilities Commission permit allowing the Iowa portion of the pipeline should be decided on. Should the pipeline be built, it would become one of the world's largest carbon capture projects, moving up to 12 million metric tons of CO2 a year to storage. The company said last year that it had already obtained voluntary easement agreements from 75 percent of the Iowa landowners along the route. A response to the counties’ petition will be announced by the Supreme Court November 6.

Montana district court dismisses youth-led climate lawsuit. On October 15, the US District Court for the District of Montana dismissed Lighthiser v. Trump, a youth-led lawsuit charging that three of the President’s energy-related Executive Orders (EOs) will accelerate climate change, causing “irreversible harm” to the plaintiffs and violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty. They asked the court to invalidate the EOs and order the President, as well as 11 federal agencies also named as defendants, not to enforce or implement them. The court found that, while the activists had shown they would be harmed by these policies, their injuries could not be redressed by the court: “This court would be required to monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction. This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent.” The ruling continued, “With this understanding in mind, the Court reluctantly concludes...that it cannot grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek.” Following the ruling, the lead lawyer for the 22 plaintiffs announced their intent to appeal.

Supply chain integrity

Rare earths update. On October 9, in the latest move in the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced tighter restrictions on exports of products containing five more rare earths – bismuth, indium, molybdenum, tungsten, and tellurium. Rare earths, among them lithium, copper, and cobalt, are essential to modern technologies ranging from laptops and phones to electric vehicles. The addition of the five minerals to the restricted list tightens supply chain concerns for companies worldwide that are already seeking replacements for the other rare earths affected by Chinese restrictions imposed in early April.

The US currently imports the majority of its critical minerals, and the federal government is striving to change that. On October 20, President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a United States–Australia policy framework to secure and diversify critical minerals and rare earths supply chains spanning mining, separation, and processing. (Find out more about the framework in our alert.) In addition, in recent weeks the federal government has been working to develop domestic rare earths capacity. On October 6, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that the federal government intends to purchase a 10-percent share in Canadian rare earths developer Trilogy Metals (NYSE:TMQ), with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5 percent to accelerate the company’s exploration in Alaska’s remote, mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. Also on October 6, the White House announced it will allow the construction of the 211-mile Ambler Road, and President Trump directed that permits for the project be issued promptly. On October 1, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced a significant investment in British-Columbia-based Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), which plans to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the world’s largest known measured lithium resource and reserve. And in July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in Las Vegas-based MP Materials (NYSE:MP), owner of the Mountain Pass mine, the only rare earth mine and processing facility currently operating in the US.

Energy and natural resources

Trump Administration’s plan to revive coal industry moves forward. On September 29, the Trump Administration announced the next steps in its sweeping plan to revive the mining and use of coal in the US. The Department of the Interior announced it will open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining, lowering royalty rates and streamlining approvals. A press release from the Interior Department states that such lease sales are already underway for sites in Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. At DOE, Secretary Chris Wright announced in late September that the Administration will continue using emergency authority “to stop the closure of coal plants.” On September 30, the DOE announced a major funding opportunity, “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” offering a total of $625 million in awards to address two “topic areas,” Coal Recommissioning, Retrofit, and Modernization Projects and Rural Capacity and Energy Affordability. On October 15, the media outlet NOTUS reported that the majority of those funds, $525 million, were originally appropriated by Congress under the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. Though the funds were intended for carbon capture programs and rural energy projects, the DOE funding notice states that coal projects may be eligible for awards from the funds originally allocated for carbon capture projects even if they do not immediately include carbon capture utilization and storage components. The Administration’s initiative to revive the coal industry is in accordance with two Executive Orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid.”

Nuclear reactor update. DOE has added four more companies to the Fuel Line Pilot Program, created to help establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain for testing new reactors and to fast-track the commercial licensing of reactors. Newly selected by DOE for the program are Oklo Inc., whose small-scale advanced Aurora reactors can be fueled by recycled nuclear waste; Terrestrial Energy Inc., developer of the Integral Molten Salt Reactor powered by molten salt fission technology; TRISO-X LLC, which is developing tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel for the commercial market; and Valar Atomics, which is developing high-temperature gas reactors that use TRISO fuel. The federal government is supporting the development of SMRs under two Executive Orders, “Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy” and “Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security.”

The US military will be among the beneficiaries of this move to build new reactors. On October 15, the US Army announced Project Janus, which aims to build and bring online small modular reactors (SMRs) on nine Army bases as soon as 2027. The program, a partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit, seeks “to provide clean, reliable energy for federal installations and other critical infrastructure.” The reactors will be commercially owned and operated. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the government is already working with private companies that are developing SMRs small enough to be transported on airplanes or trucks and even forward deployed. The US Navy’s submarine fleet is already fully powered by reactors, and the Navy is currently developing the next generation of naval nuclear propulsion infrastructure. In July this year, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) issued Oklo a Notice of Intent to Award for an SMR to be sited at Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska.

SEC signals potentially significant changes to Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal process. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested that the agency may be amenable to arguments from Delaware-incorporated companies seeking to exclude precatory shareholder proposals from company proxy materials. His statements and the SEC’s planned regulatory agenda may denote significant changes to the shareholder proposal process for the 2026 proxy season. See our Market Edge blog.

UN SSE releases Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures. The United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (UN SSE), in partnership with the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, has released Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, designed to support issuers and listed companies in understanding and disclosing nature-related issues. Climate change, UN SEE commented during the guide’s October 1 release, poses material risks to businesses, investors, financial institutions, and markets. The guidance sets out information that is clear, consistent, and science-based to help entities identify, assess, disclose, and respond to their impacts on nature, which “in turn strengthens risk management, improves transparency, drives accountability, and helps direct capital towards nature-positive outcomes, building resilience and long-term value.” UN SSE also announced that, via its SSE Academy, it will soon launch a new training program for market participants worldwide on nature-related financial disclosures.

Federal banking regulators withdraw climate risk guidance for large banks. The federal banking agencies have withdrawn the Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, a framework created to help large financial institutions – those with $100 billion or more in total assets – address climate-related financial risks. In a joint press release, the agencies stated that the principles are not necessary because supervised institutions already must comply with existing safety and soundness standards and already “should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.” As we reported in the spring, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency withdrew its participation in the interagency principles on March 31. On October 16, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also withdrew. The principles, the press release stated, have been rescinded “effective immediately.”

European Commission urged to exclude fossil fuel developers from SFDR’s “sustainable” investment categories. In an open letter sent on September 30, more than 120 signatories – among them financial institutions, think tanks, environmental nonprofits, and prominent academics – called on the European Commission to exclude fossil fuel developers from financial investments that are labeled sustainable. The Commission is currently considering revisions to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), legislation put in place in 2019 which sets out how financial market participants must communicate sustainability information. The SFDR allows three different categories to describe the sustainability of financial products: one for funds with a sustainable investment objective; another for funds that meet lower ESG criteria; and a third to be used by funds that meet none of the ESG standards. The letter states that “developing new fossil fuel projects – a long-term investment incompatible with global climate goals – is a clear indication” that a company has no plans to transition to net zero. It concludes: “We advocate strongly for a strict exclusion of companies developing new fossil fuel projects to serve as reference for all future SFDR categories.” Read the letter here.

Sustainability in the marketplace

Indonesia reopens international carbon trading. With the overarching goal of generating new foreign investment and achieving net zero, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has signed a decree ending the country’s four-year moratorium on international carbon trading. The Indonesian government, which had become one of the world’s leading sources of carbon credits, stopped such sales to international buyers in 2021, stating that it preferred to focus on meeting domestic emissions goals. Over the last couple of years, however, it has worked to more closely collaborate with global certification registries, signing mutual recognition agreements with such entities as Gold Standard, the Joint Crediting Mechanism, and Verra; it also introduced its own domestic carbon exchange, starting to offer credits to international buyers earlier this year. President Subianto’s decree requires that traded carbon units be verified either under recognized international standards such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or Indonesia’s national standards. Aiming to ensure transparency and accuracy while avoiding double counting, Indonesia has also established a decentralized registry to record carbon units in real time.

Industrial, manufacturing, and tech companies report on their readiness for extreme weather events. A report from insurance company FM of 800 risk decision-makers at global industrial, manufacturing, and technology companies finds that 62 percent of respondents have experienced severe business disruptions from extreme weather events over the past three years – but those respondents still report significant gaps between perceived and actual preparedness for future weather disasters. Four in ten companies, FM noted, report that their boards regularly discuss extreme weather risks, and 80 percent of the study’s respondents told FM that their employees are increasingly concerned about their company’s exposure to weather risks. Furthermore, compared to five years ago, the report found that corporate boards have a far more nuanced understanding of these risks – an understanding that extends to the vulnerability of entire supply chains and business ecosystems. However, the respondents also said that significant gaps remain between perceived and actual preparedness: their current insurance, most reported, would cover about half of potential weather-related impacts. Respondents also reported that their companies are under-adopting risk mitigation measures that could harden their facilities against weather disasters.

According to Drewry’s Container Forecaster 3Q25, containership charter rates remain on an upward trajectory, still 200% higher than in 2019, despite the sharp fall in spot freight rates. However, the consultancy warns that a market correction is inevitable after a five-year boom.

At the same time, UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) paints a broader picture of a fragile maritime economy. Global shipping, which moves over 80% of the world’s merchandise trade, is entering a period of stagnation. After firm expansion in 2024, seaborne trade growth is projected to slow to just 0.5% in 2025, signaling a near standstill. Long-distance rerouting caused by geopolitical tensions led to a record 6% increase in ton-miles in 2024, but at the cost of operational efficiency and stability.

Diverging Markets and Supply Constraints

Drewry highlights several structural and geopolitical factors behind the disconnect between freight and charter markets:

Tight Vessel Availability: Major carriers such as MSC and CMA CGM have absorbed large volumes of second-hand tonnage, reducing the pool available to non-operating owners (NOOs). Liner-owned fleets now account for 64% of the global total, up from 54% in 2019, limiting supply and pushing up charter rates

Geopolitical Disruptions: Ongoing insecurity in the Red Sea and diversions around the Cape of Good Hope have extended voyage times, reduced vessel availability, and inflated charter demand

Strategic Carrier Behavior: Carriers, prioritizing service reliability and alliance commitments, are securing long-term charters as a hedge against volatility

Regulatory Pressures: Emissions regulations under the IMO and EU ETS have intensified demand for dual-fuel and eco-efficient ships, creating a “scarcity premium” for compliant vessels.

A Global Trade System in Flux

UNCTAD warns that political tensions, new tariffs, and shifting shipping routes are redefining global trade geography. The United States and several partners have introduced new trade measures, including tariffs and port fees targeting foreign-built or foreign-operated vessels, which could raise costs further. These shifts have led to more rerouting, skipped port calls, and higher overall transport costs, MBN reports.

Meanwhile, energy shipping patterns are also shifting: coal and oil volumes are declining amid decarbonization efforts, while gas trade continues to grow.

Environmental and Digital Transitions at the Core

The IMO’s upcoming Net-Zero Framework, which will introduce a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism by 2028, demands unprecedented investment in clean fuels and port infrastructure. Yet only 8% of the global fleet is equipped for alternative fuels, highlighting the scale of modernization required.

Digitalization is also reshaping port strategies, as operators accelerate efforts to improve efficiency, reduce emissions, and adapt to new trade realities.

Outlook

Drewry expects the freight–charter rate gap to persist through most of 2026, with average charter rates continuing to edge upward while global freight rates could decline by around 16%. Eventually, the combination of slowing demand, squeezed carrier margins, newbuild vessel deliveries, and the reopening of the Suez Canal route is expected to trigger a correction.

In parallel, UNCTAD emphasizes that sustainable growth will depend on how effectively the shipping industry manages its twin transitions environmental and digital, while navigating geopolitical and regulatory turbulence.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-10/CargoVessel.jpg?h=38fc0f45&itok=aPPRwvhw,N,,2025-10-31 19:00:45.542853
