At a panel discussion in Juneau on Wednesday, members of tribes and conservation organizations said there’s a solution: using cleaner fuel.

Heavy fuel oil is the stuff from the bottom of the barrel — the waste product at the end of the oil refining process. It’s cheaper than distillate fuels and is used widely by most of the large cruise ships that travel along Alaska’s coastline every year.

When it’s burned, heavy fuel oil exhaust releases sulfur oxide into the air, which can cause heart and lung disease and lead to acid rain. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, required ships that burn heavy fuel oil to use scrubbers, which filter the exhaust through seawater.

Aaron Brakel is a clean water campaigner at the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, which organized the panel. He said scrubbers didn’t solve the pollution problem — they just moved it into the ocean.

“They spray the water, transferring pollutants from the air into the water from the exhaust,” he said. “Most of the scrubbers worldwide, most of the ones here in Alaska, are open-loop systems.”

That means they pump seawater infused with toxic exhaust back into the ocean instead of storing it and disposing of it at an onshore facility.

Nearly 80% of the cruise trips made in Alaska last year burned heavy fuel oil through open-loop or hybrid systems. Hybrid scrubbers can switch between dumping the effluent or storing it, depending on discharge regulations in the waters the ship is passing through.

Brakel probed into U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records and found that between 2023 and 2024, 17 ships using open-loop scrubber systems reported more than 700 water quality violations off the coast of Alaska, as Alaska Public Media reported last month. But the data doesn’t show exactly where the violations happened.

Kay Brown is the Arctic policy director at Pacific Environment, an advocacy nonprofit. Last year, she and her colleagues published a literature review of studies around the world on the negative effects of scrubbers.

“The big takeaway here is that scrubber pollution is toxic to marine life at very low concentrations,” Brown said.

One study found scrubber wastewater at a concentration of 5% killed tiny crustaceans called copepods within one day, and called the wastewater a “witch’s cauldron” of toxic compounds. Another study found that exposure to scrubber discharge affected the reproduction success of some mussel and sea urchin species at even lower concentrations.

Several Southeast tribes have passed resolutions calling for cleaner fuel, including the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, the Organized Village of Kake, the Organized Village of Kasaan and the Ketchikan Indian Community.

Ilsxilee Stáng Gloria Burns is president of the Ketchikan Indian Community. She said she wants cruise lines to take initiative.

“This practice of fuel dumping makes the cruise ships an extractive industry,” she said.

Burns said the onus is on the cruise industry to build a relationship of reciprocity instead.

Linda Behnken is the executive director of the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association and board president of Alaska’s Sustainable Fisheries Trust. She’s fished commercially for 40 years and says the statewide seafood marketing strategy is built on telling the story of Alaska’s healthy, pristine waters.

“To have this information, to me, where we know sort of that dirty secret, I feel like we’re being disingenuous by continuing to build our reputation on this,” she said.

Behnken said Alaskans have a responsibility to protect the water from pollution.

Cruise ships that burn heavy fuel oil are equipped to switch between fuel types.

Some regulations have already taken effect in U.S. waters. Last year, the IMO banned heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, with some fuel tank exceptions. Scrubber discharge is restricted in Hawaii’s waters and banned within the Port of Seattle. California has long required ships to burn cleaner fuels upon entering its waters.

Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, attended the panel. He said he’s concerned about water pollution from scrubbers, but hasn’t decided on a policy path yet.

He said he’s been meeting with a lot of people about it, including cruise companies.

“We had some serious conversations and they presented some research, some of which I bought and some which I didn’t,” Kiehl said.

Cruise Lines International Association Alaska represents the cruise industry.

“There is no scientific basis to support a ban on [scrubbers],” CLIAA spokesperson Lanie Downs wrote in an email, adding that they “remain an important compliance option as the maritime sector continues to reduce air emissions.”

Alix Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry director, said in an interview that there’s a long-standing voluntary commitment from the cruise lines to switch to marine gas oil when they’re in Gastineau Channel, while in Juneau’s cruise port and upon departure.

“All we can do is make agreements and ask that they be followed, and even if we did have legislation, I don’t know what our compliance program would look like,” Pierce said.

She said the city has no reason to believe ships aren’t honoring the commitment. But in 2019, Gov. Mike Dunleavy axed state funding for the Ocean Rangers program that had observers aboard cruise ships, so there is no longer oversight on oil slicks. The state’s wastewater permits and ship inspectors only address sewage and grey water, not scrubber wastewater dumping.

Pierce said the city is working to help find alternative shipping fuels through a partnership between ports and cruise lines called the Pacific Northwest to Alaska green corridor project.

“We’re excited to see how we can kind of continue to try to drive change in the alternative fuel space, because that’s really the future,” she said.

She said the group will publish a report in the next few months looking at the feasibility of transitioning cruise ships to another fuel type called green methanol, which can be produced from municipal or agricultural waste. The IMO suggests it could cut carbon and sulfur oxide emissions. Pierce said the effort could move the needle beyond the scrubber problem and meet IMO’s goal to make shipping a net-zero emissions industry by 2050.

Juneau’s last cruise ship of the 2025 season will depart next Tuesday.

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.

The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.

While Exxon plans to start offering bunkering services in 2027, it is also “actively developing complementary supply solutions” to support customers who are ready to adopt LNG before that time, the company said in a statement, stopping short of providing details.

It is not clear where the two vessels, chartered respectively from Avenir LNG and Evalend Shipping in the first and fourth quarter of 2027, will be deployed. The ships will be capable of transporting both LNG and biogas-derived bio-LNG.

New Addition

LNG bunkering appears to be a new addition to the $30 billion in “low-carbon opportunities” identified by Exxon during its corporate plan update in December last year — some of which have been facing headwinds. It included low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, lithium, carbon materials and its patented Proxxima high-performance polymer.

The foray into bunkering marks a key step in supporting the maritime industry’s decarbonization efforts.

“Both LNG and bio-LNG can help reduce lifecycle GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions compared with conventional marine fuels,” Exxon global lower emission fuel manager Amy Wood said.

“As the maritime industry looks for scalable solutions to reduce GHG emissions, Exxon Mobil is leveraging its skills and capabilities to deliver these fuel options,” Wood said.

Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.

Ships, which move close to 90% of global goods, still run overwhelmingly on oil products, but mounting climate pressure, technological breakthroughs and shifting capital are converging to reshape the industry’s fuel choices toward low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory Push

Exxon’s foray into LNG bunkering comes as “supportive policies and rising demand for LNG in marine transportation are creating opportunities,” the company said, emphasizing that technology-neutral policies are essential to accelerate the adoption of lower GHG emission marine fuels.

The US major did not specify which policies it was referring to, but International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states are due to decide at a London meeting on Oct. 14-17 whether to approve the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) designed to put shipping on a trajectory to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The NZF consists of a global fuel standard, a GHG pricing mechanism with credit trading and a revenue-recycling scheme that would use the revenues from the pricing regime to fund green fuel initiatives.

The outcome of the vote is hard to predict. At the last IMO meeting, there was heavy opposition from a handful of flag states and oil exporters, and overt pressure from the Trump administration has also complicated the politics. But the NZF requires a majority of member states, rather than full consensus, to pass.

The shipping industry emits more than 1 billion tons of CO2 annually, accounting for approximately 3% of global human-caused emissions, according to Japanese shipping firm NYK Line.

Transition Fuel

LNG-ready ships account for around 7% of the global fleet by tonnage, the largest share among alternative fuel pathways, supported by existing bunkering infrastructure and local air quality benefits over fuel oil.

Some research suggests the NZF will favor the deployment of ammonia in the medium term, while others estimate it could support first-generation biofuels or even LNG in the short term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last month in its Global Hydrogen Review.

“A lot will hinge on the guidelines to be developed in the next few months, and in particular on the default emission factors included in the guidelines on life-cycle GHG intensity of marine fuels,” the IEA said.

LNG is viable as an NZF compliance option over the next five to 10 years, experts and shippers say, but it isn’t generally considered a scalable zero-emission fuel because it still emits CO2 and methane.

Some observers argue that with container vessels typically built for 20–25 year lifespans, LNG newbuilds could face stranded asset risk by the mid-2030s as IMO rules tighten and increasingly favor hydrogen-derived fuels.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768c284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5476x2875+0+447/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2Ffe%2F67a481e54f2b9f1b901530266064%2Fss498488416-logos-companies-exxon.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:56:22.294452

According to MARBEM, there were an estimated 247,000 tonnes of methane emissions in 2023 from shipping’s global LNG-fuelled fleet. These emissions, they claim, translated to nearly US$950M in annual climate damages – a near-fourfold increase from 2016, when the estimates stood at around US$250M.

The figures incorporate damages and deaths from the effects of ground-level ozone, a critical pollutant formed by methane, and, while significant, the group said it does not fully represent the impact of the pollution.

""This figure still understates total harm by excluding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, localised air quality, and non-fatal health outcomes such as asthma and hospitalisations,"" MARBEM said.

In its research, MARBEM said it used the US EPA’s Social Cost of Methane, a monetary benchmark of the human and environmental impacts of methane-based pollution that the group said is consistent with internationally recognised values.

The group said it aims to provide independent, evidence-based data ""that enables and encourages the sector to make tangible commitments towards future-ready shipping solutions"".

The newly formed initiative said it is working with policy experts, financial analysts, economists and research institutions to target the uptake of fuels in the maritime sector that are lower in greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous pollutants than methane-based LNG.

With partners in 13 countries focused on the LNG supply chain, including fossil, bio and e-LNG, MARBEM said it aims to ""clarify regulations, technologies, and analyse the trends influencing maritime decarbonisation"".

""LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG dual-fuel vessels accounting for 55% of the current orderbook. If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10% of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030. At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bioLNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emissions future,"" the group said.

With major decisions coming up at shipping’s United Nations-based regulator the International Maritime Organization and within the European Union on the substance of plans for the shipping sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions around 2050, MARBEM said it would be working directly to influence regulators.

""In the months ahead, Maritime Beyond Methane will actively engage with IMO, and with EU regulators through the FuelEU negotiations, to inform decisions in line with global climate ambition, supporting the advancement of regulatory frameworks that use informed decision-making that keeps the shipping sector on track towards a just, net-zero emissions future,"" MARBEM said.

""The shipping sector is nearing a critical juncture to be able to move the dial on getting off LNG, and avoiding any alternative that enables locking-in methane and going farther down a pathway where monetary penalties, costly retrofits and early abandonment of vessels will get more severe with the continued use of methane-based fuels that have no real impact on decarbonising shipping and addressing the climate crisis.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/151/Gate-Terminal_at_Rotterdam_source_Gate_Terminal_1200w_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 16:56:56.192500

This action, as stated by Kofe was not a retreat but a deliberate message, reflecting an inability to endorse a framework that delayed justice and left vulnerable nations unprotected. Abstention was used to register profound disappointment in both the process and the outcome.

According to the statement, the Pacific region remains adaptable and determined, returning to London with six submissions that outline a clear course for the institution to follow:

On MEPC submission ES.2-2-13:

Essential additions are proposed to the IMO’s adopting resolution to ensure it reflects the commitments already made by Member States. Consistency with international law, the Paris Agreement, and the IMO’s own 2023 Strategy is sought — so that the resolution upholds the principle of a just and equitable transition and recognises the particular vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

On MEPC submission ES.2-3-3:

The Net-Zero Fund should be operational by 2026 — not 2029. The current timeline leaves developing countries without the readiness finance needed to prepare for the transition. The IMO is urged to recognise food security as a critical part of the disproportionate negative impacts faced by vulnerable economies. The Fund must be built to leave no country behind.

On the Net-Zero Fund timeline:

Waiting until 2029 for support is unconscionable. The proposal accelerates the Fund’s establishment and calls for readiness finance to flow by 2026. Delaying until 2029 risks billions in lost support — billions that should already be building resilience and a just transition.

On governance of the Fund:

Justice must be written into its design. An equal split on the Board is proposed: seven seats each for SIDS and LDCs; developing countries; and developed countries. That is how equity becomes real.

On zero- and near-zero fuels:

Only scalable, truly clean solutions should qualify. Scarce resources must not be wasted on false options that buy more years for fossil fuels. Fuels that compromise the environmental integrity of the Net-Zero Framework, slow the energy transition, and endanger food security must be avoided.

On climate science:

The evidence is clear. 2024 was the first year the planet stayed above 1.5 °C for twelve consecutive months. The IPCC made it clear in 2018 that 1.5 °C is a dangerous threshold — not just for Pacific Islands, but for the planet as a whole. In Tuvalu, the impact is already felt: the land is disappearing underfoot.

While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific Island nations must consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake.

We are here to lead high ambition, as we always have. Our abstention at MEPC 83 was a signal: Tuvalu will not rubber-stamp weak outcomes. At this Extraordinary Session, we call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival.

The move—decades in the making—marks a turning point for one of the world’s most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

A Price on Pollution

At the core of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is a simple but powerful idea: if you emit, you pay. From 2027, ships over 5,000 gross tons—responsible for about 85% of the industry’s CO₂ emissions—will be subject to mandatory emissions limits and a global fuel pricing system. Those that outperform the thresholds earn rewards; those that exceed them must buy “remedial units” or contribute to the IMO’s new Net-Zero Fund.

The system is expected to raise $11–12 billion annually by 2030, funding cleaner fuel innovation, seafarer training, and technology transfer to developing nations. In other words, the polluters help pay for the transition.

One Global Standard, Not Many

For years, industry leaders warned of the risks of a fragmented patchwork of regional carbon rules—from the EU’s ETS to national carbon levies. “A unified global system is essential,” said one member of the Getting to Zero Coalition, “otherwise shipowners face conflicting regulations and distorted competition.”

That call seems to have been heard. The new framework, backed by the EU27, BRICS, and major flag states, reflects a rare global alignment. Shipowner groups and maritime associations have lined up in support, urging IMO member states to finalize the deal during the MEPC E.2 session (October 14–17).

The Politics of Progress

Still, the consensus isn’t universal. The United States has reportedly expressed “serious reservations,” with some sources suggesting Washington is seeking to delay adoption until after further domestic review. But with mounting pressure from both industry and environmental groups, few expect that to stall the process.

As one European delegate put it this week: “If not now, when? The industry is ready. Investors are ready. The world is watching.”

Rewarding Early Movers

Unlike traditional carbon taxes, the IMO’s approach combines penalties with incentives. Ships that switch early to low- or zero-emission fuels—like green methanol or ammonia—stand to earn credits that can be traded or sold. That reward mechanism, observers say, could accelerate fuel adoption faster than regulation alone ever could.

“Every ton of CO₂ avoided becomes an asset,” said a technical advisor at Global Maritime Forum. “That changes the economics entirely.”

What Happens Next

Once adopted, technical negotiations will continue into 2026 to refine operational details and verification systems. For shipowners, the clock will be ticking fast toward 2027 compliance. Ports and fuel suppliers, too, will need to adapt—because once a carbon price is set, there’s no going back to free emissions.",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-apple-touch-icon-32x32-optimized.png,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:20.907408

With the longest coastline in the world, an exclusive economic zone of nearly six million km², and the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system linking the Atlantic Ocean to North America’s industrial heartland, Canada’s prosperity has always been tied to the sea. It is only natural to build upon that strength.

The Government of Canada’s Projects of National Interest list appropriately highlights the significance of ports and marine infrastructure for Canada’s economy and trade. Key projects include expanding the Port of Montreal, significant offshore wind development in Nova Scotia, and enhancing northern ports for increased shipping through the Northwest Passage.

But this moment is also about more than building port capacity and doubling down on fossil fuel exports. The next round of nation-building announcements, expected imminently, will provide a critical opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate that it understands the increasingly significant link between clean electricity and economic power.

Ports are critical in the supply chain—connecting offshore wind to the grid, linking shipping to industry, and tying together rail and road networks. Modern, electrified ports can maximize generational investments in clean energy by serving as hubs for offshore wind, energy storage, sustainable fuel trade, and electrified transport.

Geopolitical heavyweights already understand this. China and India are moving at breakneck speed to electrify their ports to support cleaner economic growth and trade. If Canada is serious about competing with global players, it must be able to meet the world where it is going. With abundant wind and solar resources, Canada has a natural advantage in the clean energy transition. Not harnessing it risks falling behind—and facing penalties for the goods we export.

The international shipping sector is moving rapidly to impose penalties for dirty shipping, and reward early adopters of zero- or near-zero-emission shipping fuels such as those derived from green hydrogen. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is targeting steep reductions in the carbon intensity of international shipping, with a goal of being net-zero by 2050. Measures including cleaner standards and a global emissions pricing mechanism are being finalized and are expected to be in force in just two years. The Global Maritime Forum estimates the demand for hydrogen-derived shipping fuel, such as e-methanol and e-ammonia, will be over 500 million tonnes by 2040 due to these regulations, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity and hundreds of thousands of green jobs.

Canadian ports and shipping companies need help with supply and access to zero-emission fuels and renewable energy. Without it, Canada’s world class ports of today, Port of Vancouver, Port of Montreal, and Port of Halifax risk being a destination for the world’s most polluting ships.

The government has an opportunity to leverage its historic investments in nation-building projects and port infrastructure to unlock market opportunities for Canadian hydrogen producers and renewable energy developers. To remain competitive with the EU and China, Canada must grow trade without also growing emissions.

Canadians are counting on the federal government to balance economic development with climate action. By embedding clean fuels, electrification, and marine clean tech into today’s port investments, Canada can lead as a strong G7 economy, a responsible ocean nation, and a partner in building a climate-competitive future.",https://climateinstitute.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/modernizing-canada-ports.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:31.792561

In early September, African leaders convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Second Africa Climate Summit, which focused on overcoming the obstacles to climate-resilient development on the continent. In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action.

As part of that process, they are increasingly recognizing that decarbonizing shipping – an industry that generates nearly 3% of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialization.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations’ maritime regulator.

Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar.

A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialization, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2% of global investment in renewables.

But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless.

Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments.

If designed properly, the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit.

Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.

A quiet revolution is underway in the maritime sector. Often obscured from popular view, yet championed by emerging innovators and leaders in the ports and shipping world, the global maritime industry is at the heart of a clean energy revolution.

While headlines are dominated by tariff strife and shifting climate politics, global shipping is propelled by a powerful counter-narrative of rapid and far-reaching decarbonisation. Once dismissed as a ""hard-to-abate"" sector, the maritime industry’s complex and interconnected global network is a perfectly positioned platform for large-scale climate action.

From hard-to-abate to First Movers

Recent decisions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have set the global shipping sector on a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, with binding interim targets for 2030 and 2040. This top-down policy direction is being reinforced by bottom-up market demand, as cargo owners increasingly commit to decarbonising their supply chains. Amazon has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040, while IKEA has committed 100 percent zero-emission ocean shipping within the same timeframe/

These combined forces of regulatory ambition and market demand are driving a systemic transformation across the maritime value chain. Meeting this challenge will require coordinated action, innovative solutions, and the collaborative engagement of stakeholders across the global maritime sector.

Once dismissed as a ""hard-to-abate"" sector, the maritime industry’s complex and interconnected global network is a perfectly positioned platform for large-scale climate action.

Corridors of Collaboration

For decades, the ports of Shanghai and Los Angeles have worked together despite geopolitical rifts. In 2022, they co-launched the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, one of the world's first initiatives to commit to deploying zero-emission vessels and fuels across the busiest trans-Pacific trade route. By linking cities, ports, carriers, and fuel providers, this shows how a shared climate vision can transcend political boundaries.

Beyond Shipping: Cities at the forefront of decarbonisation

Decarbonising maritime transport is not just a shipping story. Cities bear a significant share of the burden. Communities adjacent to ports experience elevated rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases, highlighting the urgent need for action on local air quality. At the same time, port decarbonisation can unlock new opportunities for cities, driving economic development, spurring innovation, and creating high-quality green jobs that position local economies at the forefront of the clean energy transition.

Port cities are increasingly emerging as leaders in climate and clean energy innovation. Barcelona exemplifies this approach: the city government and port authority are aligning port electrification and shore power projects with citywide climate and energy strategies. This integrated approach enables Barcelona to advance its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, while simultaneously reducing pollution and improving health outcomes for residents.

In Durban, South Africa, the city and port authority are jointly pursuing renewable energy deployment and electrified port operations. These upgrades not only align with Durban’s climate commitments but also support the city’s trade capacity under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Yokohama, Japan, offers another illustrative model. The city is partnering with utilities and start-ups to pilot battery tankers that transport electricity from offshore wind farms to residents. This innovative approach directly contributes to Yokohama’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Trade Diversity through Clean Energy Exports

As trade patterns are reshaped by tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions, nations are increasingly pursuing diversified trade strategies while simultaneously vying for position as the future suppliers and exporters of clean fuels. Investments in port and logistics infrastructure are being designed to serve a dual purpose: to expand trade capacity and to capture a share of the evolving global market in green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other low-carbon fuels.

In Canada, the Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur expansion is strengthening direct trade with Europe and Asia, positioning the port as a hub for India and Indo-Pacific markets, while the Port of Halifax is emerging as a future gateway for Canadian clean energy exports. In Peru, the newly inaugurated Port of Chancay provides a Pacific corridor that shortens shipping times to China, enabling direct exports of minerals and, in time, clean fuels to Asia. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the expansion of the Port of Manzanillo will enable it to handle up to 10 million containers annually by 2030, providing the country with a strategic platform to serve both Asia and Latin America.

Investments in port and logistics infrastructure are being designed to serve a dual purpose: to expand trade capacity and to capture a share of the evolving global market in green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other low-carbon fuels.

Maritime Decarbonization Gains Investor Momentum

The Corvus transaction illustrates a broader shift in climate finance toward industrial and infrastructure applications, as investors seek tangible carbon reduction at scale. Maritime battery technology is becoming a critical piece of that puzzle, particularly in regions where regulatory pressure and green corridors are advancing rapidly, such as Northern Europe and North America.

Norway, where Corvus is headquartered, has become a testbed for low-emission shipping technologies, driven by state-backed incentives and early market adoption among ferry operators. Corvus’s expansion will likely benefit from this ecosystem as it scales production and deepens partnerships with shipbuilders and port authorities.

Global Implications for Climate Investors

For institutional investors, the deal reflects growing appetite for climate-linked private equity in sectors that blend hard technology with measurable decarbonization outcomes. Shipping’s emissions challenge—combined with its dependence on fossil fuels—makes it a natural candidate for such targeted investments.

By leading the funding round, Morgan Stanley’s 1GT not only reinforces confidence in Corvus Energy’s technology but also demonstrates how mainstream finance is moving deeper into industrial decarbonization. As global maritime regulations tighten and zero-emission vessel demand accelerates, the partnership is positioned to play a defining role in shaping the future of clean shipping.

At a time when capital allocation is shifting from commitments to execution, the Corvus Energy investment reflects a clear direction of travel: scaling technologies that convert climate ambition into operational impact.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Morgan-Stanley-Backs-Corvus-Energy-with-60M-to-Accelerate-Maritime-Decarbonization-scaled.webp,N,,2025-10-10 12:58:09.638560

Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.","Despite being far from perfect, the world’s first global carbon pricing scheme on any international polluter—global shipping— is expected to be adopted next week.

Countries will meet on October 14-17 for the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC E.2) to formally adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF), designed to help achieve the IMO’s climate targets set out in the 2023 Revised Strategy.

The planned adoption of the legally-binding regulation will be followed by a round of technical negotiations (ISWG-GHG-20) on key details on design and implementation of this flagship climate regulation, on October 20-24.

Sealing the deal next week on the IMO NZF, agreed in a vote back in April, would be the biggest victory for climate diplomacy in recent years. It would also send an important signal ahead of the COP in Belém that multilateralism can deliver climate action.

Back in April 2025, the IMO agreed on the NZF in a vote at MEPC 83, with a clear majority of countries (63) voting in favor, including China, Brazil, the EU27, South Korea and India, versus a minority opposition (16) led by the Saudis, the UAE and Russia. 25 countries abstained, including Pacific Island states who chose to abstain as a protest against the decision-making process and the weak level of ambition in the agreed framework.

Key supporters are expected to include: most of the BRICS, the EU27, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Panama, and Chile.

The shipping industry supports adoption through the World Shipping Council (WSC), with over 180 global shipping companies stating the NZF is necessary to provide a global regulatory certainty that “allows the industry to do its job.”

A minority of petrostates led by Saudi Arabia and the US have been trying to undermine the agreement since April. Pacific Island states abstained during the April vote as a protest against the process.

Critical policy details in the NZF still remain to be finalized between the adoption and 2027 when it enters into force, including the definition and rewards for zero-emission energy and technologies and how the revenues, worth up to $15 billion/year from 2030, will be spent.

“While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific Island nations are forced to consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake. We are here [at the IMO] to lead high ambition, as we always have. Our abstention at MEPC 83 was a signal: Tuvalu will not rubber-stamp weak outcomes. At this Extraordinary Session, we call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival. The IMO must find the courage to deliver this time,” Simon Kofe, Minister of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs, Tuvalu, stressed.

“The successful adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework is essential as a baseline for the international shipping industry to achieve the emissions reductions that are so desperately needed. But that is only the start – not the end – of states’ abilities to push for the ambition demanded by climate vulnerable countries. Negotiations around the definition of zero, or near-zero fuels and the distribution of revenues will cement this agreement as one that prioritises justice and equity in the maritime transition,” Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, said.

“The Net Zero Fund established under the IMO Net Zero Framework offers a crucial opportunity to make the maritime transition more equitable. For Africa, where fleets are limited and ageing, and where access to traditional ship finance has been scarce, fair access to this Fund could enable the renewal of vessels and support the continent’s ambitions under the African Continental Free Trade Area. To ensure a truly just and inclusive transition, it’s essential that the Fund’s design includes dedicated financing windows for developing economies,” Maria Ogbugo, Maritime Consultant at the Africa Policy Research Institute, commented.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect – lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels, and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition – but it is a vital step forward. During this meeting, IMO Member States must not only adopt the Net-Zero Framework but agree on a realistic and robust plan for fixing the framework’s failings and putting shipping on a truly sustainable path to zero-emission shipping,” Delaine McCullough, President of the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), highlighted.

“The clarity that will be given with the adoption of the Net Zero Framework should not be underestimated. This key policy signal and associated guidelines have the potential to unlock billions of dollars of investment in the production of scalable zero emission fuels early on. Only with the adoption as soon as possible does the IMO have a chance to meet its objectives from the Revised GHG strategy for zero- or near-zero emission fuels making up 5% to 10% of shipping fuel by 2030,” Nishatabbas Rehmatulla, Principal Research Fellow at the UCL Energy Institute, Shipping & Oceans Research Group, explained.

“Ahead of the IMO Net-Zero Framework vote, the facts are undeniable: LNG is not a viable solution for shipping. Methane — a highly potent greenhouse gas, 82 times that of CO2 — from LNG-fueled ships grew by 180% between 2016 and 2023, directly contradicting industry rhetoric. LNG is fundamentally incompatible with shipping’s decarbonization goals. Regardless of its origin (fossil, bio-, or e-LNG), methane leaks across the entire fuel lifecycle. LNG must be excluded from the Net-Zero Framework, or the IMO risks enabling a false solution and undermining its climate credibility,” Elissama Menezes, Director at Equal Routes, said.

“Member states have never waited for permission to lead. Regardless of the United States’ stance, member states must hold firm and get the Net-Zero Framework over the finish line in October. The International Maritime Organization’s April agreement is a win for our climate, health and oceans, marking the first time the shipping industry agreed to a global carbon price. Now, they must see it through—not only for the planet we share, but to honor the family legacy we owe to future generations: a legacy of health, security, and prosperity.We applaud this decisive step toward a just, zero-emissions future in shipping,” Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director with Pacific Environment, stated.

Global shipping industry strongly supports IMO NZF

International maritime associations and organizations have reiterated their “strong support” for the adoption by the world’s governments of IMO NZF.

The global industry said it remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully “this carefully balanced” regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050, with necessary incentives to de-risk investment in new green marine fuels to accelerate the total decarbonization of international shipping and to implement a just transition for the maritime workforce.

“Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation. With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field,” WSC, International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), and the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) emphasized in a joint statement.

The maritime transport sector, which moves 90% of global trade, is ready to play its important part in delivering a sustainable future.

Mr Corrigan commented, “We are pushing for it hard, and I think everybody wants to do the right thing, but it is a complicated endeavour.
Mr Corrigan warned, “We demand the threat of double taxation be removed as it will kill our operators and could quadruple fuel costs in a few years.
Mr Corrigan sums up, “The conference reinforces the ferry community around the world.
Our job at Interferry is to grow the pie, and our operators can fight over the slices of the pie.”","Interferry chief executive Mike Corrigan has highlighted how important batteries are for ferries – and how necessary shore power is for the sector.

He told PST in an exclusive interview, “The ferry sector has been leading the charge towards zero emissions for quite a while. We did it originally because it is the right thing to do for communities and for the planet, and now the regulations are also coming in. We want solutions and ours is simple: we have the batteries, let us plug them in and we can go to zero emissions.”

He emphasised that batteries are the main way in which the ferry sector can decarbonise. “Batteries are the first, second and third place option. I don’t think there’s a clear indication on other fuels, and the main thing is we know batteries work, that electrification works, and that is why we are pushing it so hard. Some of our members are trying methanol and hydrogen, but I think the short- and medium-term solution is electrification.”

A major topic at the Interferry annual conference – held in Sorrento, Italy this year – was the lack of shore power available at ports.

Mr Corrigan commented, “We are pushing for it hard, and I think everybody wants to do the right thing, but it is a complicated endeavour. There are the electrical companies, the governments – all players that work together to get the funding. But even if they manage it, it can take up to 10 years to get the infrastructure in place to charge these vessels.”

He singled out just one ferry would need 40 or 50 MW of power.

“We work closely with port associations and do outreach with the local communities, but it is a multi-pronged approach, Interferry, operators, the ports and everybody.”

Another issue for Interferry, which was covered at the conference, is the potential for double taxation for ferry operators, should IMO affirm its rules on fuel intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. These instruments would be parallel with the EU’s policies on emissions and fuels, the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Mr Corrigan warned, “We demand the threat of double taxation be removed as it will kill our operators and could quadruple fuel costs in a few years. That has to go to the customer at the end of the day. That is the challenge, you can’t be taxed twice in two different jurisdictions, it is not done anywhere else.”

He points out the IMO MEPC session in October has to pass the motion on the legislation. If it does, there is the potential for double taxation. “We will be leaning on the EU to not have that happen.”

Asked about his key takeaways from the annual conference, which saw connections as its theme, with an emphasis on lifeline ferries, Mr Corrigan said, “It has driven home how important ferries are in the world. The fact is we move as many passengers as the airlines do and bring along cars as well.”

He said the conference highlighted the commonality among ferry operators all over the world, from electrification, to regulations, safety, cyber security and trying to understand what AI is about.

The conference saw Cruise Lines Industry Association chief executive Bud Darr take to the stage, highlighting the potential for more collaboration between the two industry associations. “We have in the past collaborated, but Bud takes us to the next level.” Mr Corrigan points out in his recent role at MSC Group, Mr Darr was part of Interferry’s regulatory committee, representing MSC Group-owned GNV, therefore “it is a natural fit and Bud worked well with us over the year”.

Mr Corrigan sums up, “The conference reinforces the ferry community around the world. People really care about each other; competitors are on the stage talking together. Our job at Interferry is to grow the pie, and our operators can fight over the slices of the pie.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/159/Mike_Corrigan_Interferry.JPG,N,,2025-10-10 08:56:44.651270

As explained, Maritime Beyond Methane provides independent evidence-based data that enables and encourages the sector to make tangible commitments towards future-ready shipping solutions.

LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG-dual fuel vessels accounting for 55 percent of the current orderbook. If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10 percent of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030.

At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bio-LNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emission future.

According to the initiative’s statement, the shipping sector is nearing a critical juncture to be able to move the dial on getting off LNG, and avoiding any alternative that enables locking-in methane and going further down a pathway where monetary penalties, costly retrofits and early abandonment of vessels will get more severe with the continued use of methane-based fuels that have no real impact on decarbonizing shipping and addressing the climate crisis.

The global LNG-fueled fleet’s estimated 247,000 tons of methane emissions in 2023 translated to nearly US$950 million in annual climate damages — a near-fourfold increase from 2016, when the figure stood around US$250 million.

This estimate builds on the U.S. EPA’s Social Cost of Methane, a monetary benchmark consistent with internationally recognized values, by incorporating the effects of ground-level ozone, a critical pollutant formed by methane. This figure still understates total harm, excluding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, localized air quality, and non-fatal health outcomes such as asthma and hospitalizations.

In the months ahead, Maritime Beyond Methane will actively engage with the IMO, and with EU regulators through the FuelEU negotiations, to inform decisions in line with global climate ambition, supporting the advancement of regulatory frameworks that use informed decision-making that keeps the shipping sector on track towards a just, net-zero emissions future.

LNG as a future fuel will be debated a great deal at next week’s vote on the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework.

Elissama Menezes and Andrew Dumbrille, directors of Equal Routes, serve as MARBEM’s secretariat, with the pair writing for Splash last week, suggesting: “Once the IMO applies this comprehensive life-cycle approach under the framework’s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels – LNG, biomethane, and e-methane – cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives, exposing the industry’s rhetoric for what it is: false promises that have propped up LNG all along.

Despite LNG’s popularity as an alternative fuel, methane emissions have been the Achilles’ heel undermining its climate credentials.

However, Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) made headlines on Wednesday when it announced it had achieved a 98% reduction in methane slip during sea trials using a new methane oxidation catalyst and engine modification system aboard an LNG-fuelled coal carrier panamax.

By proving a near-total elimination of slip in real-world sea conditions, MOL and partners may have handed LNG a crucial lifeline in the decarbonisation debate.

In a surprise intervention, Christopher Wiernicki, the departing chairman and CEO of ABS, the third largest shipping classification society in the world, came out against IMO’s planned net zero framework last month.

“Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories. There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation,” Wiernicki said at the launch in London of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook, backing greater support for LNG as a bridging fuel.

“Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways,” Wierniki said, his LNG viewpoint is something that is supported by rival class society DNV.

Peter Keller, chairman of SEA-LNG, a lobby group supporting the super chilled fuel as an alternative shipping fuel, claimed earlier this week: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

LNG’s credentials as shipping’s leading alternative fuel have driven much debate for years, attracting much criticism from academics, NGOs, and even the World Bank.

Overall, 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in the first nine months of 2025, with LNG-fuelled vessels accounting for the majority of these orders at 121, followed by 43 orders for methanol-fuelled ships, with the remainder made up by LPG carriers (19), ammonia-fuelled vessels (5), and hydrogen-fuelled vessels (4), according to data from DNV.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LNGOceanRebellion.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:56:39.363521

The IMO NZF will form a new Chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex VI, applying to sea-going ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above; vessels which collectively account for roughly 85% of international shipping’s CO₂ emissions.

At present, 108 state parties are bound by Annex VI, covering about 97% of the world’s merchant fleet by tonnage. The IMO NZF aligns with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, which commits the sector to reach net-zero GHG emissions “by or around 2050” with indicative checkpoints for 2030 and 2040.

At the heart of the IMO NZF lies a global Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (‘GFI’) standard, based on lifecycle or “well-to-wake” accounting that measures emissions across both upstream fuel production and onboard combustion.

In essence, what this means is that, under the IMO NZF, shipowners will be required to account for the greenhouse gas emissions (‘GHG’) generated across the entire lifecycle of marine fuels, from extraction and production through to onboard combustion, a process referred to as “well-to-wake” assessment. This encompasses both “tank-to-wake” emissions produced during fuel use onboard, and “well-to-tank” emissions arising from the upstream stages of fuel production, processing, and transport, including associated sustainability considerations.

Compliance Mechanisms and the Net-Zero Fund

Each ship will be required to achieve progressive reductions in fuel intensity over time, measured against two benchmarks: a Base GFI Target representing the minimum performance threshold, and a more stringent and ambitious Direct Compliance Target. Essentially, the fuel mix of a vessel complying solely with the Base Target would result in a higher average annual GFI compared to that of a vessel also achieving the Direct Compliance Target. In calculating compliance with the GFI targets, shipowners will be required to report the full “well-to-wake” emissions of their fuels, covering both production and sourcing, as well as onboard combustion. This will create a need for a robust certification system to verify the carbon intensity and sustainability credentials of fuels. Fuel producers aiming to supply low-carbon fuels for IMO compliance, along with bunkering companies and shipowners, will need to understand and operate within this new certification framework.

Ships that exceed the Direct Compliance Target will generate Surplus Units, which may be sold, banked or transferred to other vessels. If a vessel fails to meet its target, compliance can be restored either by using the Surplus Units generated within its own fleet/acquired from other fleets, or by purchasing Remedial Units through contributions to the IMO-managed Net-Zero Fund.

The IMO is presenting the Net-Zero Fund as a fund which will serve as both a compliance backstop and an incentive pool. It is being stated that payments from non-compliant ships will finance research and development, fuel-infrastructure deployment, and capacity-building initiatives, particularly for developing countries, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. Funds may also be allocated to reward operators that exceed the required emission-reduction targets, with the aim of directing financial flows toward supporting decarbonisation while promoting a fair and equitable transition across the sector.

The International Chamber of Shipping (‘ICS’), representing over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, has welcomed the IMO NZF and emphasised that “the IMO needs to formally adopt the Net-Zero Framework in October to send a clear signal to industry and provide the incentive needed to produce these cleaner fuels. Industry needs clarity, simplicity, and detail on the rewards.”

In a statement to Lloyd’s List, the leaders of seven major shipowner associations, including those of Japan, Singapore and the UK, urged IMO member states to “make history in London” by adopting the Net-Zero Framework, describing it as “set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.”

If adopted in October, the IMO NZF will mark a major milestone in the regulatory architecture for maritime decarbonisation. Following adoption, the IMO will finalise detailed guidelines on certification, lifecycle-emission calculation, and registry rules at MEPC 84 in 2026, with data collection and reporting expected to commence in 2028.

Interplay with Regional Frameworks

While the IMO NZF has received broad industry support, notable regional and political complexities persist, with opposition to the measures becoming more pronounced in recent months. Within the EU, the Fit for 55 legislative package encompasses the Emissions Trading System (‘EU ETS’), the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (‘Fuel EU Maritime’), along with other measures.

The EU ETS has applied to maritime transport since 1 January 2024 for ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at EU or EEA ports, with surrender obligations phasing in from 40% of 2024 emissions to full coverage by 2027. Global mid-term measures under the IMO, such as the NZF, are not currently considered equivalent to the EU ETS, and the European Commission has yet to determine whether they should be treated as such. As a result, the implications for EU decision-making within the broader Fit for 55 framework remain uncertain.

Having said that, the revised EU ETS Directive includes a review clause requiring the Commission to assess ETS provisions following the adoption of any IMO global market-based measure, ensuring regulatory coherence and avoiding double regulation. If the IMO adopts such a measure, the Commission must submit a report within 18 months evaluating ambition, environmental integrity, and alignment with EU law, and may propose legislative amendments to harmonise the regimes. Should no IMO measure be adopted by 2028, the Commission may propose expanding the EU ETS so that surrender obligations for voyages between EU and non-EU ports cover more than 50% of emissions.

Adding to this complexity, the FuelEU Maritime is comparable to the IMO NZF in that it sets mandatory limits on the GHG intensity of fuels used onboard, with targets that become increasingly ambitious over time. There is therefore potential duplication between the FuelEU Maritime and the IMO NZF, as a non-compliant ship could, in theory, be penalised under both regimes. The FuelEU Maritime acknowledges this overlap and also includes a review clause obliging the European Commission to reassess its provisions if the IMO adopts a global fuel standard or market-based measure, with a view to aligning EU provisions with international requirements where appropriate. Further clarity will be needed from the Commission on how such overlaps will be managed, particularly as the IMO NZF is still in the process of becoming fully operational.

The ICS has urged the European Commission and other jurisdictions with regional schemes to align with the forthcoming IMO regime, noting that “those with unilateral and regional schemes, such as the EU ETS, should agree to having one clear and transparent system under the IMO. This is critical if we are to meet the time frames set out.” The call reflects growing industry concern that overlapping carbon pricing frameworks could undermine regulatory certainty and slow the sector’s decarbonisation investment momentum.

Political and Industry Landscape

The adoption of the IMO NZF will also test international consensus. At MEPC 83 in April, agreement was reached with 63 countries voting in favour, 16 against, and 24 abstaining. Although the vote passed, it marked a departure from the IMO’s usual preference for consensus. Several states, including the United States, have raised concerns about the pricing element, describing it as a de facto global tax.

Adoption, as expected in October’s MEPC extraordinary session, requires approval by a two-thirds majority of parties to Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention that are present and voting at the session itself. Following approval, the IMO NZF would undergo MARPOL’s tacit-acceptance procedure and is then expected to enter into force approximately 16 months later, around early 2027. This is unless one-third or more of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or parties representing not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet, object to the measures within the said timeframe. Worth noting that any individual state party may file an objection to the IMO NZF, effectively exempting itself from its application.

Conclusion: Outlook for Global Maritime Decarbonisation

Failure to reach agreement at IMO level risks accelerating regional fragmentation, as individual states or blocs may advance with their own carbon pricing regimes. This would expose ships to overlapping and potentially inconsistent charges depending on their trading routes, an outcome that would undermine regulatory clarity and efficiency. As noted by Lloyd’s List senior reporter Declan Bush, failing to adopt the IMO NZF does not mean climate regulation will go away. Instead, it will likely mean more rules, not fewer. The forthcoming vote will therefore be pivotal in determining whether maritime decarbonisation proceeds along a unified global trajectory or splinters into a patchwork of regional frameworks.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/5219a30978885d6004deccc0cd324e9e2cde65f6-1760083950-352f1b3c-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:56:06.606672

This means that wind propulsion can help you meet IMO’s decarbonisation standards faster and more cheaply.
Wind propulsion is a win-win: clean energy, lower costs and more skilled jobs and the energy is free, clean and available now.","The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is upcoming. Wind-assisted propulsion cuts costs, creates jobs, and earns compliance bonuses—delivering climate action, affordable trade, and a just transition, argues Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas At Risk.

As the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization (IMO) prepares to meet in London to discuss the finer details of how to decarbonise the shipping industry, member states hold many cards. The question is, how will they choose to play them? Some will push for ambition, some will stall, and some may even play their ‘trump card’ to try and block progress altogether, but one play is clear: adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF) on how to decarbonise shipping is vital if progress is to be made.

Adopting the IMO’s NZF is a no-brainer but competitiveness, job security and freight costs will weigh heavily on decision-making when designing and implementing the Framework. Since the IMO did state that “the transition [to decarbonisation] should be just and equitable”, I am here to play my wind propulsion card.

I was recently involved in commissioning Seas At Risk’s Wind First report, and the results confirmed what many of us already suspected: Ships equipped with suction sails or rotor sails can cut fuel costs by up to 18%, which actually means savings of up to half a million dollars per ship, per year. These savings will help ship owners pay for new, expensive e-fuels coming in the future. It also means that they will be less affected by fuel price volatility and emission compliance costs demanded by the EU and IMO. By retrofitting sails on existing vessels or designing brand new ships altogether means that shipping costs stay steadier and everyday products don’t get even more expensive for consumers.

Installing wind assisted propulsion technology isn’t just about cutting fuel costs. In a world where jobs are being replaced by emerging technologies, wind propulsion is one innovation that actually creates them. Shipyards and port workers around the world can be trained to install and maintain wind systems, and, given time, can even manufacture parts. As more ships adopt wind assisted propulsion, installation capacity and technical training must be scaled up to avoid bottlenecks. This offers real and skilled jobs to shipyards and ports particularly in Africa, Latin America and small island developing nations, who can become hubs of new maritime jobs.

So far, wind assisted propulsion is starting to get its wings (pun intended), but it still has a way to go before it’s widely adopted in the industry. That’s where the IMO’s NZF comes into play. While the framework mainly focuses on reducing fuel intensity and shifting from polluting fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, through the guidelines, it has the potential to also reward clean technologies such as wind through “technology-specific multipliers”. In other words, every tonne of CO2 you cut with wind power earns you extra “credits”, giving ships a compliance bonus, or financial incentive for meeting their targets, on top of their fuel savings.

This means that wind propulsion can help you meet IMO’s decarbonisation standards faster and more cheaply. A higher compliance value under the NZF will speed up global adoption and attract investment into emerging markets. For lower- and middle-income countries, supporting the framework is not only about climate, it’s about creating jobs, strengthening industrial capacity, and keeping trade affordable.

So, all of this to ask the delegates who will attend the IMO next week to not just adopt the Framework, but use the technical negotiations that will follow to give wind propulsion the spot they merit: as the first, best solution in the toolbox. Wind propulsion is a win-win: clean energy, lower costs and more skilled jobs and the energy is free, clean and available now.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berge-Olympus-with-WindWings.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:56:17.363400

In the days leading up to the extraordinary IMO session in London, divisions have deepened between powerful shipping nations and industry heavyweights. On one side, seven major shipowner associations from Japan, Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Singapore have issued a rare joint appeal urging governments to “make history” by endorsing the framework. On the other, opposition has coalesced around influential figures such as John Fredriksen, prominent Greek shipping groups, key classification societies, and even the United States government.

The coalition of supporting associations described the NZF as a “turning point for global climate regulation,” warning that failure to adopt it would fragment the sector with a “patchwork of regional rules” and undermine the global energy transition. “Our industry, by its very nature, is global — and it needs a global solution to tackle climate change,” their statement declared.

If approved, the framework would introduce a global carbon levy and fuel standard to steer the shipping sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. It would also establish a Net Zero Fund to incentivize compliance and finance green maritime infrastructure.

While expressing general support for the framework’s goals, the global tanker association INTERTANKO urged caution on implementation timelines. “The NZF offers clarity and predictability,” said Emma Scheiris, INTERTANKO’s deputy director for environment. “But its rollout must balance ambition with operational feasibility.”

However, major shipowners — including Dynacom, GasLog, Seapeak, and Stolt Tankers — have publicly opposed the plan, calling for “critical amendments” before it is adopted. Collectively, they control a significant share of the world’s tanker and gas carrier capacity. “In its current form, the NZF does not deliver on its stated aim of fair and effective decarbonisation,” the group said.

Greece’s shipping minister Vassilis Kikilias echoed their concerns during talks with IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, insisting that “substantive changes are essential” for Greece to lend its support.

Despite the pushback, Dominguez remains optimistic. “I am confident the framework will be adopted,” he told delegates in London. “We have a long history of overcoming divisions through cooperation.”

The IMO traditionally relies on consensus, but insiders suggest that a formal vote now appears inevitable. If members fail to reach agreement, approval will require backing from two-thirds of the 176 MARPOL Annex VI signatories — at least 108 countries.

Backing from the Getting to Zero Coalition, which represents more than 180 companies and some of the world’s largest shipowners, has intensified pressure on member states. “Delays threaten billions in clean shipping investments,” the group warned. “Without global rules, costs will rise for everyone — from shipowners to consumers.”

Complicating the picture, the United States remains staunchly opposed to the NZF. Washington walked out of April’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting and has since warned that nations supporting the deal could face trade and diplomatic repercussions, including tariffs, port charges, or visa restrictions.

Analysts say the outcome could hinge on a handful of undecided countries — particularly in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America — where geopolitical and economic priorities are finely balanced.

“FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise,” he said.
Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to ask critical questions before joining any pooling scheme: Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they?
“In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for,” Mr Ioulianou concludes.
Look for partners with the expertise, systems, and integrity to manage risk—because compliance doesn’t come cheap, and neither should your standards.”","With the EU ETS reporting deadline passed and FuelEU Maritime enforcement fast approaching, EmissionLink Managing Director, Philippos Ioulianou, has cautioned shipowners against treating compliance pooling as a cost-cutting exercise, warning that a cheap pool that hides risk is worse than no pool at all.

Pooling has rapidly become one of the industry’s hottest topics as operators seek efficient pathways to meet FuelEU and ETS obligations. Yet according to Mr Ioulianou, a fixation on price risks undermining the very purpose of the regulation.

“FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise,” he said. “It’s a fundamental shift in regulatory responsibility. If shipowners view it simply as a budget line item, they risk stepping into the very pitfalls the regulation was designed to prevent.”

Pooling allows operators, particularly smaller fleets or those lacking access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels. When managed correctly, it can smooth compliance and lower costs. But mismanaged pooling can expose participants to significant liabilities.

Once in a pool, a vessel’s carbon intensity is tied to that of every other participant. If one underperforms, or if the pool manager fails to act, all members face penalties. That raises crucial governance questions around performance monitoring, mid-year corrective actions, and responsibility for penalties or surpluses.

Mr Ioulianou warns that many pooling schemes on offer today focus mainly on cost, often using market indexes as benchmarks, while ignoring governance, accountability, and risk management.

“Price references may guide cost but they don’t account for who’s responsible when things go wrong. Strong governance, continuous monitoring, and maritime expertise are what make pooling viable. Without them, the compliance risk multiplies.”

Drawing parallels with the IMO’s proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), Mr Ioulianou noted that similar governance challenges are emerging at a global level.

“The same dynamic is visible in the IMO debate. Ambition is outpacing accountability. Regulators are setting decarbonisation timelines that don’t fully reflect fuel availability or technological maturity. The lesson is clear, without governance and industry alignment, frameworks don’t reduce risk—they redistribute it.”

As Columbia Group CEO Mark O’Neil observed during LISW, the gap is most evident with alternative fuels. Their potential is clear, but the challenges of adoption and the pace at which the industry can transition must be carefully managed.

Central to EmissionLink’s approach is the belief that pooling only works when built on transparency, continuous monitoring and maritime expertise. Participants must know how performance is tracked continuously, not just at reporting deadlines, and someone must carry responsibility if things go wrong.

Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to ask critical questions before joining any pooling scheme:

Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they?

What happens if performance dips?

How are penalties and surpluses distributed?

How do FuelEU, EU ETS, and IMO frameworks align—or conflict?

“In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for,” Mr Ioulianou concludes. “Don’t be seduced by the cheapest pool. Look for partners with the expertise, systems, and integrity to manage risk—because compliance doesn’t come cheap, and neither should your standards.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EmissionLink-empowers-shipowners-to-minimise-FuelEU-impact-through-accurate-emissions-data-and-predictive-insights.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:56:52.934083

“As the maritime industry looks for scalable solutions to reduce GHG emissions, Exxon Mobil is leveraging its skills and capabilities to deliver these fuel options,” Wood said.
Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.

“As the maritime industry looks for scalable solutions to reduce GHG emissions, Exxon Mobil is leveraging its skills and capabilities to deliver these fuel options,” Wood said.

Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.

Ships, which move close to 90% of global goods, still run overwhelmingly on oil products, but mounting climate pressure, technological breakthroughs and shifting capital are converging to reshape the industry’s fuel choices toward low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory Push

Exxon’s foray into LNG bunkering comes as “supportive policies and rising demand for LNG in marine transportation are creating opportunities,” the company said, emphasizing that technology-neutral policies are essential to accelerate the adoption of lower GHG emission marine fuels.

The US major did not specify which policies it was referring to, but International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states are due to decide at a London meeting on Oct. 14-17 whether to approve the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) designed to put shipping on a trajectory to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The NZF consists of a global fuel standard, a GHG pricing mechanism with credit trading and a revenue-recycling scheme that would use the revenues from the pricing regime to fund green fuel initiatives.

The outcome of the vote is hard to predict. At the last IMO meeting, there was heavy opposition from a handful of flag states and oil exporters, and overt pressure from the Trump administration has also complicated the politics. But the NZF requires a majority of member states, rather than full consensus, to pass.

The shipping industry emits more than 1 billion tons of CO2 annually, accounting for approximately 3% of global human-caused emissions, according to Japanese shipping firm NYK Line.

Transition Fuel

LNG-ready ships account for around 7% of the global fleet by tonnage, the largest share among alternative fuel pathways, supported by existing bunkering infrastructure and local air quality benefits over fuel oil.

Some research suggests the NZF will favor the deployment of ammonia in the medium term, while others estimate it could support first-generation biofuels or even LNG in the short term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last month in its Global Hydrogen Review.

“A lot will hinge on the guidelines to be developed in the next few months, and in particular on the default emission factors included in the guidelines on life-cycle GHG intensity of marine fuels,” the IEA said.

LNG is viable as a NZF compliance option over the next five to 10 years, experts and shippers say, but it isn’t generally considered a scalable zero-emission fuel because it still emits CO2 and methane.

Some observers argue that with container vessels typically built for 20–25 year lifespans, LNG newbuilds could face stranded asset risk by the mid-2030s as IMO rules tighten and increasingly favor hydrogen-derived fuels.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768c284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5476x2875+0+447/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2Ffe%2F67a481e54f2b9f1b901530266064%2Fss498488416-logos-companies-exxon.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 22:56:46.044466

Now, while some of the world has gone a little ga-ga over Taylor Swift’s new album (who could blame them?), there’s plenty happening in the world of shipping.

Next week is shaping up to be a big one, with Australia joining the vote on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, the global plan to decarbonise shipping. The framework sets emissions limits, a carbon pricing system, and new fuel standards, all aimed at achieving net-zero by 2050, which could affect freight costs, fleets, and port infrastructure down under.

At the same time, the US is rolling out its controversial new port fees targeting Chinese-linked vessels, which could impact bulkers, tankers, and containerships calling at American ports. Ship operators will need to get their paperwork and payments in order, while China has already promised countermeasures.

Baltic operator Wallenius SOL has transitioned two of its five vessels, Baltic Enabler and Botnia Enabler, from LNG to liquefied biogas (LBG), also known as bio LNG. The switch has been made possible through a new supply agreement with Gasum, one of the leading providers of renewable gas in the Nordic region.

The move is part of Wallenius SOL’s Climate Roadmap, which sets out a pathway to operate entirely on renewable fuels by 2035 and to reach no harmful environmental impact by 2045. The introduction of LBG into regular operations represents a significant step in that transition.

The company’s roadmap outlines a gradual shift from transitional fuels to fully renewable alternatives. LNG has been a bridge fuel for recent years, and with the agreement with Gasum, Wallenius SOL is now fully replacing it with biogas. Bunkering LBG in Botnia and Baltic Enabler is an important step to reach their full potential, and to strengthen the entire Wallenius SOL fleet in its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint.

“The transition from LNG to LBG is an important milestone for Wallenius SOL,” says Rebecca Tagaeus, the company’s sustainability officer. “It shows that renewable fuels are not a distant solution but something we can use here and now. Switching to LBG for Botnia and Baltic Enabler is clear proof that our Roadmap is delivering, and that we are investing in our customers’ climate goals.”

Organic sourcing

For customers, the change reduces the carbon footprint of transport without affecting schedules, performance, or booking procedures. LBG is produced from organic waste streams such as residues from agriculture and food production. Because it is chemically identical to LNG, the vessels can operate with no technical modifications. The main difference is that LBG is renewable; the carbon it contains is part of a short natural cycle, as opposed to fossil carbon released from underground reserves. This means that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced from a life-cycle perspective. Lower emissions also mean that customers can reflect improvements in their Scope 3 reporting.

The LBG used by WALLENIUS SOL will be produced from Nordic residual streams, ensuring no conflict with food production. The LBG is certified under RED II and traceable via ISCC.

Partnership with Gasum

Gasum will supply the biogas under a pooling arrangement designed to support renewable fuel uptake in the shipping sector. By aggregating demand from several customers, the arrangement helps scale up supply and build stability in the market. For Wallenius SOL, it provides access to consistent volumes of LBG and ensures that the fuel can be introduced in regular operations.

“We are very excited that Wallenius SOL has decided to join our FuelEU Maritime pool, as this collaboration enables us to open even more regulation surplus to shipowners,” says Jacob Granqvist, vice president, maritime at Gasum. “Pooling is a brilliant and easy opportunity for all maritime actors to join forces in lowering emissions from the industry together.”",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/walsol.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:56:13.920578

At the close of MEPC 83 at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), Tuvalu and our 6PAC+ allies abstained. That choice was not a retreat, but a message. We could not endorse a framework that delayed justice and left vulnerable nations unprotected. Abstention was the only way to register our profound disappointment in both the process and the outcome.

But disappointment is not defeat. The Pacific adapts, but we do not give up. We return to London with six submissions that set out a clear course for this institution to follow.

On MEPC submission ES.2-2-13:

We propose essential additions to the IMO’s adopting resolution to ensure it reflects the commitments already made by Member States. We seek consistency with international law, the Paris Agreement, and the IMO’s own 2023 Strategy — so that the resolution upholds the principle of a just and equitable transition and recognises the particular vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCS).

On MEPC submission ES.2-3-3:

We call for the Net-Zero Fund to be operational by 2026 — not 2029. The current timeline leaves developing countries without the readiness finance needed to prepare for the transition. We also urge the IMO to recognise food security as a critical part of the disproportionate negative impacts faced by vulnerable economies. The Fund must be built to leave no country behind.

On the Net-Zero Fund timeline:

Again, waiting until 2029 for support is unconscionable. Our proposal accelerates the Fund’s establishment and calls for readiness finance to flow by 2026. Delaying until 2029 risks billions in lost support — billions that should already be building resilience and a just transition.

On governance of the Fund:

Justice must be written into its design. We propose an equal split on the Board: seven seats each for SIDS and LDS; developing countries; and developed countries. That is how equity becomes real.

On zero- and near-zero fuels:

Only scalable, truly clean solutions should qualify. Scarce resources must not be wasted on false options that buy more years for fossil fuels. We cannot risk locking in fuels that compromise the environmental integrity of the Net-Zero Framework, slow the energy transition, and endanger food security.

On climate science:

The evidence is clear. 2024 was the first year the planet stayed above 1.5 °C for twelve consecutive months. The IPCC made it clear in 2018 that 1.5 °C is a dangerous threshold — not just for Pacific Islands, but for the planet as a whole. In Tuvalu, we already feel the impact: the land we call home is disappearing under our feet.

While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific Island nations are forced to consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake.

We are here to lead high ambition, as we always have. Our abstention at MEPC 83 was a signal: Tuvalu will not rubber-stamp weak outcomes. At this Extraordinary Session, we call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping.

Anything else would be a major setback for the green transition and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations.

This October, the member states of the International Maritime Organization can make history by finally adopting an agreement on climate regulation of the shipping industry – and thus becoming the first global industry to do so.

As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.

The backstory is as follows: In 2023, IMO agreed on a greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy stating that global shipping must become climate neutral around 2050. This was followed earlier this year by the principal agreement on the regulatory framework necessary to make the ambitious GHG-strategy a reality. This Net-Zero Framework must now be finally adopted at the IMO-meeting in London in mid-October.

The Net-Zero Framework entails concrete mandates for the reduction of emissions from ships as well as a pricing mechanism that puts a cost on undercompliance and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard. These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions. Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology.

Final approval at the IMO meeting requires a qualified majority of member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention. It is important that such a majority comes together to shepherd the agreement across the finish line. Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change.

The alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks. Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition. We therefore also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.

To deliver on the agreed upon GHG strategy, global regulation is a precondition. It is necessary for reducing emissions, for creating homogeneous and predictable framework conditions for the shipping industry and – perhaps most importantly – sending the strongest possible signal to investors and producers to scale up the production of the alternative fuels that the shipping industry will require to move towards zero emissions.

The industry supports the IMO Net-Zero Framework, as evidenced by the formal declaration of support of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the clear support of the European Shipowners (ES | ECSA). The co-signers of this article appeal to the IMO member states to come together and vote for global climate measures.

Let’s take the next step and move towards net-zero together. Let’s make history in London.

‘Unstoppable consequence’

“Sea level rise is a slow, but unstoppable consequence of warming that is already impacting coastal populations and will continue for centuries,” commented Prof. Natalya Gomez, co-author of the study and Canada Research Chair in Ice Sheet–Sea Level Interactions at McGill University.

“People often talk about sea level rising by tens of centimetres, or maybe a metre, but in fact it could continue to rise for many meters if we don’t quickly stop burning fossil fuels.”

The study evaluated scenarios of between 0.5 and 20 metres of sea level rise, and found that even with a rise of just 0.5 metres – the most optimistic emissions pathway – around three million buildings could still be affected by flooding.

If global emissions continued at their current pace, leading to sea level rise of five metres or more over the next few hundred years, more than 100 billion buildings could be at risk, including both neighbourhoods and critical infrastructure such as ports and refineries.

“We were surprised at the large number of buildings at risk from relatively modest long-term sea level rise,” added Prof. Jeff Cardile, co-author and professor at McGill University. “Some coastal countries are much more exposed than others, due to details of the coastal topography and locations of buildings.”

If the issue comes to a vote in the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session, a two-thirds majority of the 176 voting members is required in order to adopt the framework.

Many of those in favor of the framework are organized in the Copenhagen-based Getting to Zero Coalition, which has a list of 180 shipping companies signed up to support the initiative. Inevitably, those shipping companies in favor of the framework tend to be those who have invested in modernization of their fleets, and whose zero emission vessels will be levy-free, having met the emission targets. This group includes prominent shipping groups such as Maersk, Anglo Eastern, Blue Star, Carnival, Grimaldi, Hapag-Lloyd, MSC, Mitsui OSK and Wan Hai Lines. Another group within the coalition are those entities that suffer from the concentrated effects of ‘dirty’ vessels, including the ports of Amsterdam, Antwerp, Bremen, Dunkirk, Gothenburg, Kiel, London, Montreal, Rotterdam and Seattle.

Some notable shipping lines are against the framework and are seeking amendments to the framework, notably TMS, Capital Maritime & Trading, Angelicoussis, Frontline, GasLog, Hanwha Shipping, Seapeak, Stolt Tankers and Saudi giant Bahri, tanker and bulker interests who are warning of ‘excessive financial burdens’ on the industry and consumers, should the framework be adopted and carbon levies be imposed on vessels which do not meet standards from 2027 onwards.

Over the course of a half an hour or so, the pair discussed the concept of sustainability as a mindset focused on longevity and resilience rather than short-term gain. As Godin noted, sustainability requires systemic change, and storytelling has the power to shift collective behaviour by building movements rather than isolated actions.

For investors and consumers alike, he said, the key to achieving positive actions from sustainability is about aligning incentives with the long-term good, as well as amplifying systems that promote positive human behaviour.

SustainabilityOnline was in attendance – here are some of the key takeaways from the discussion.

On defining sustaianbility

“There’s a lot of ways to talk about sustainability. I can talk for a very long time about the climate emergency that we’re all facing – and we should talk about it – but sustainability should be more than that.

“I don’t think that I would have succeeded far more by conventional metrics, if I had not chosen a sustainable path. There’s always a hustle to be done. There’s always a way to reach more to the bottom. You can steal from sleep. You can steal from trust. You can steal from attention. And I discovered – I think when I was around 17 – that when I did that kind of theft, I could get ahead in the short run, but it wasn’t going to be what I signed up for.”

On the right kind of action

“The word ‘act’ is the key to the whole thing. One person acting changes nothing. But if we can tell a story of community action, we can tell that story in a way that’s going to change things for the better.

“If you think about a company like Patagonia, which is worth billions and billions of dollars, they’re not worth billions of dollars because they make fleece. Lots of people make fleece. They’re worth billions of dollars because they raced to the top, by organising people. They didn’t race to the bottom by hustling.”

On creating new systems

“What we’re looking for here in terms of action is not ‘oh, it’s Thursday, I’m gonna do one really good thing today’. What we’re looking for is how do we create new systems, where you get social status – more of what you seek – by doing things that lead to resilience.

“The easiest way to attract the crowd is to cry wolf. The easiest way to attract the crowd is to punch somebody in the face. We’re not interested in attracting the crowd. We’re interested in consistently and persistently building systems that permit people to thrive.”

On effective activism

“The work of activists and communities is to bring the future to the present. When you bring the future to the present, then they are in alignment. And the thing is, because we’re all hooked on convenience, consumers don’t do that. Consumers say, ‘yeah, it is better today, so I’m not all that worried about the future’. So if you, as a consumer, aren’t worried about the future, then all the people who have short-term incentives aren’t going to worry about the future either. […]

“Day by day, we have a choice. We race to the top or we race to the bottom. It’s very simple. I know many of you are just doing your job. I know you’ve got a lot of stuff going on, but if you’re in this room, you care. And the way to take action is to find and amplify a community – persistently and consistently, over time. Systems cannot resist this. If you do this, the system will change.”

On amplifying the right message

“When you build a system that amplifies the worst parts of our nature, they’re going to get amplified. […] So, when we see a system that amplifies something we don’t want, the good in us can take action and change the system.”

The WSC is also developing an industry cargo safety program, which will be launched shortly, to improve cargo screening and inspections.","Georgia Ports says it has expanded its cold storage capacity for protein exports and other temperature-controlled cargo to 2.4 million square feet, following the opening of a nearly 300,000-square foot facility in Coastal Georgia operated by MEDLOG.

Located in Rincon, Georgia, 18 miles from the Port of Savannah’s Garden City Terminal, the 291,000 square-foot facility features 42 loading docks, 20,000 freezer/cooler pallet positions and the ability to complete up to 3 million pounds of protein blast freezing per day – with the largest blast room in the nation. It is the first cold chain facility in Savannah that has a rail siding capacity for 18 rail cars, which opens new markets in the Midwest for frozen beef and pork, the port said.

In addition to frozen goods, the facility can handle fresh produce imports such as citrus, avocados, grapes and blueberries with high-tech refrigeration capabilities.

With the addition of MEDLOG’s Rincon facility, the region now features nearly 2.4 million square feet of near-port cold storage space across a dozen facilities. The gateway Port of Savannah has the capacity to power 3,800 refrigerated containers simultaneously – the most of any U.S. port.

Geneva, Switzerland-based MEDLOG is part of maritime shipping giant the MSC Group. As a supply chain operator with a presence in more than 80 countries, it continuously invests in proprietary assets, such as inland logistics platforms, warehouses, trucks, locomotives, and barges.

After American companies rushed extra orders into the country this summer to dodge looming White House tariffs, import cargo volume at the nation’s major container ports is expected to steadily decline for the remainder of the year, according to the Global Port Tracker report released today by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates.

“Tariffs have had a significant impact on trade,” Hackett Associates Founder Ben Hackett said in a release. “The trade outlook for the final months of the year is not optimistic.”

The report noted that while “reciprocal” tariffs on a number of countries took effect in early August, a federal appeals court later ruled against President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs, but left them in place while the ruling is under appeal to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Trump delayed an increase in tariffs on China by 90 days to Nov. 10 so trade negotiations could continue. Trump also announced an additional 25% tariff on India that took effect near the end of August, bringing the additional tariff rate to 50%.

“We have seen the implementation of reciprocal tariffs across the globe, with a number of key trading partners being subjected to tariffs higher than the earlier 10% tariffs,” NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. “We also continue to see more and more sectoral tariffs impacting a wider scope of products. Retailers have stocked up as much as they can ahead of tariff increases, but the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy is making it impossible to make the long-term plans that are critical to future business success. These tariffs and disruptions to the supply chain are adding costs that will ultimately lead to higher prices for American consumers.”

By the numbers, U.S. ports covered by the “Global Port Tracker” report handled 2.36 million twenty-foot equivalent units — one 20-foot container or its equivalent — in July, although numbers for New York/New Jersey, Port Everglades and Miami were estimated because they have not yet reported their data. That was up 20.1% from June as retailers brought in merchandise ahead of tariffs set to take effect in August, and up 1.8% year over year. It would be the second-busiest month on record, topped only by 2.4 million TEU in May 2022.

Ports have not yet reported numbers for August, but Global Port Tracker projected the month at 2.28 million TEU, down 1.7% year over year but higher than that 2.2 million TEU expected before the postponement of China tariffs and the new tariff on India. Likewise, September is forecast at 2.12 million TEU, down 6.8% year over year; October at 1.95 million TEU, down 13.2%, and November at 1.74 million TEU, down 19.7%. December is forecast at 1.7 million TEU, down 20.1% year over year for the slowest month since 1.62 million TEU in March 2023.

Overall, the first half of 2025 totaled 12.53 million TEU, up 3.6% year over year. The full year is forecast at 24.7 million TEU, down 3.4% from 25.5 million TEU in 2024.

While global supply chains continue to grapple with ongoing geopolitical disruptions, trade policy developments are also creating sustained trade uncertainty, according to a report from logistics software vendor Descartes Systems Group.

By the numbers, U.S. container import volumes for August were 2,519,722 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), down 3.9% from July but up 1.6% over August 2024. Of that total, imports from China eased to 869,523 TEUs in August, down 5.8% from July and 10.8% below August 2024.

“A second consecutive month of elevated container imports continues to call attention to the combined impact of U.S. tariff policy and seasonality on maritime trade, even as volumes from China declined,” said Jackson Wood, Director of Industry Strategy at Descartes. “While overall demand has remained resilient in the face of ongoing tariff volatility and geopolitical disruption, key tariff measures are now under legal challenge and headed to the Supreme Court, leaving U.S. importers to grapple with continued uncertainty as they weigh supply chain risks and mitigation efforts.”

After spiking in July, August U.S containerized imports from the top 10 countries of origin (CoOs) fell 4.4% month-over-month, posting an overall decline of 83,296 TEUs. The decrease was led by China, down 53,552 TEUs (5.8%), with notable declines from South Korea (11.8%), Japan (14.5%), and Taiwan (12.9%). Smaller drops from Vietnam (0.5%), Hong Kong (1.4%), Thailand (0.6%), and Germany (1.3%) added to the softening of volumes. Offsetting gains were limited to Indonesia (5.3%) and India (1.7%).

While those volumes are consistent with seasonal levels in August, they also underscore the probable sensitivity of U.S. importers to ongoing tariff timing, Descartes said. On the upside, despite a second consecutive month of elevated volumes, port transit time delays increased only modestly at top U.S. ports in August, as infrastructure again absorbed the added pressure without major disruption.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) is urging stronger safety measures for ocean freight, and has reinstated a cargo inspection deficiency data series to measure it.

WSC found that 11.39% of inspected cargo shipments in 2024 were found to have deficiencies, up slightly from the IMO’s final 2023 figure of 11%. These include mis-declared and undeclared dangerous goods, incorrect documentation, and improper packing—all of which can lead to serious safety incidents, including ship fires.

According to the WSC, international law empowers port states to inspect containers to ensure cargo complies with international regulations and standards, including proper declaration and packing of dangerous goods. However, few nations share those outcomes with global organizations. In fact, the group’s report on container inspections was based on statistics from just seven nations: Finland, Canada, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Chile, Germany, the Republic of Korea and the United States.

“Cargo safety starts with correct declaration and safe packing of goods. With over one in ten shipments showing deficiencies, the message is clear: gaps in cargo safety remain far too common. Cargo deficiencies put crews, ships, cargo, and the environment at risk,” Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council, said in a release. “By continuing this reporting, we can identify trends and take appropriate action to improve the safety of shipping. With only seven port states currently reporting, there is an opportunity for more governments to contribute their data, strengthening the global picture and helping to make shipping safer for everyone.”

Washington, D.C.-based WSC said that this latest reporting builds on its wider cargo safety work, from co-developing the CTU Code Quick Guide and Checklist to help pack containers safely, to supporting efforts that reduce container losses at sea and working with the IMO on stronger dangerous goods rules. The WSC is also developing an industry cargo safety program, which will be launched shortly, to improve cargo screening and inspections.

Inaugural NEMO chair Dr. Mamdouh el-Shanawany, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Assessment Section and former Nuclear Director at Lloyd’s Register (LR), said, “To achieve nuclear energy at sea, we need to find a way through maritime regulations under the IMO and nuclear requirements under the IAEA, and this workshop gives us an important first step to achieving this.”

While the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulates global shipping and the IAEA oversees nuclear safety and non-proliferation on land, participants noted that the absence of a unified framework leaves a regulatory grey area for maritime nuclear technology.

Speakers from the International Maritime Cyber Security Organization (IMCSO), the World Nuclear Transport Institute (WNTI), Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS), and the IAEA discussed cyber threats, nuclear material transport, and international security standards.

NTS representatives detailed their experience transporting Category 1 nuclear materials, though participants agreed that such measures would likely be adapted for future nuclear-powered vessels using lower-category fuel.

The workshop concluded with a group exercise simulating a nuclear-powered LNG carrier under a series of hypothetical security threats.

Delegates observed that responses to such incidents would largely mirror those for conventional ships today.

Mark Tipping, LR’s Global Power to X Director, said that establishing consistent regulation is critical for deploying maritime nuclear technology, now that fourth-generation small modular reactors (SMRs) with enhanced safety features are becoming commercially viable. Further NEMO exercises and reports are planned ahead of the next event in 2026.

The International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee will hold an extraordinary next week (October 14-17) to consider adoption of what IMO calls the “Net Zero Framework” (NZF). It’s actually what U.S, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy identified as “effectively a global carbon tax … levied by an unaccountable UN organization.”

Still, despite mounting pushback, the NZF has gained a lot of support from much of the shipping industry establishment and today several international maritime associations and organizations statement reiterating their strong support for its adoption at the upcoming MEPC session.

The organizations signing off on the statement were the International Chamber of Shipping, the World Shipping Council, the European Community Shipowners Association, the Asian Shipowners Association, the International Transport Federation (ITF), the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) and IBIA (tt=he International Bunker Industry Association).

The statement said:

“The global industry remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully this carefully balanced regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050, with necessary incentives to de-risk investment in new green marine fuels to accelerate the total decarbonisation of international shipping and to implement a just transition for the maritime workforce. Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry. Without the framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization.

“With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field.

“The maritime transport sector, which moves 90% of global trade, is ready to play its important part in delivering a sustainable future.”

Not everyone aboard

Not all the individual companies represented by these associations will be totally enthused by NZF.

During the recent London International Shipping Week, a group of powerful players in the tanker and gas carrier issued a statement saying that fundamental amendments to NZF would be required before its

adoption.

The cosignatories included Frontline, TMS Group, Capital Maritime, the Angelicoussis Group, Saudi state carrier Bahri, GasLog, Seapeak, and Stolt Tankers.

Their statement, said, in part that “the IMO NZF, as currently defined, lacks a comprehensive impact assessment and more importantly interim fuel availability checkpoints similar to previous fuel change regulations like IMO 2020. As it stands, we do not believe the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonizing the maritime industry as per the IMO 2023 strategy, nor ensure a level-playing field as intended.

“The global temperature in September 2025 was the third warmest on record, nearly as high as in September 2024, less than a tenth of a degree cooler,” commented Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate, C3S.

“A year on, the global temperature context remains much the same, with persistently high land and sea surface temperatures reflecting the continuing influence of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.”

Across Europe, the average temperature for September stood at 15.95°, which was 1.23°C above the 1991–2020 average, making it the fifth-highest September on record. The most pronounced above-average temperatures were recorded in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, while cooler-than-average temperatures were seen in certain parts of Western Europe.

Beyond Europe, above-average temperatures were recorded in Canada, parts of Greenland, northwestern Siberia, and parts of Antarctica.

Global sea surface temperatures were also at their third-highest on record in September, C3S noted, with the average sea surface temperature for September standing at 20.72°C. This was 0.20°C below the September 2023 record.

Sea-surface temperatures

Above-average sea-surface temperatures were recorded in much of the North Pacific, with some areas experiencing a record high. In Europe, record-high sea-surface temperatures were recorded in a large area from the Norwegian Sea to the Kara Sea, while the Mediterranean was largely above-average.

Precipitation patterns across Europe were mixed in September, with wetter-than-average conditions in Northwestern and Central Europe, as well as Fennoscandia, along the eastern Black Sea coast, parts of Italy, and coastal regions of Croatia and eastern Spain.

""The global industry remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO member states to implement successfully this carefully balanced regulatory package for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by or close to 2050, with necessary incentives to derisk investment in new green marine fuels to accelerate the total decarbonisation of international shipping and to implement a just transition for the maritime workforce,"" the letter said.

The coalition of groups behind the letter includes US-headquartered liner shipping lobby the World Shipping Council, the European Shipowners Association, the International Association of Ports and Harbors, the International Transport Workers’ Federation, the International Bunker Industry Association and the International Chamber of Shipping, a shipowners’ association which, alone, claims to represent 80% of the global merchant shipping fleet.

The supportive tone for the IMO regulations in the most recent open letter stands in contrast to an earlier open letter from some large tanker and bulker shipowners who said that the regulations are not fit for purpose as they are currently written. Tanker and bulker shipowners including Saudi Arabia’s Bahri, privately owned John Fredriksen-linked Frontline, UK-based Stolt Tankers as well as Evangelos Marinakis’ Capital Group and a host of Greece-based companies have called for ’fundamental amendments’ to global regulations on GHG emissions.

There are similar divisions among some of the 176 member states who will decide the outcome of the IMO climate framework during the upcoming extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee that runs between 14-17 October 2025. The member states are set to convene with the aim to finalise the text of an already-approved framework of rules that would govern the technical and economic elements of shipping’s reduction of its GHG emissions to a net of zero over the next 25 years.

The US delegation to the IMO walked out of the MEPC 83 proceedings in April 2025 that saw the NZF framework approved, apparently taking cues from US President Donald Trump and his administration’s later threats to IMO member states. The US administration threatened retaliation against member states which do not support a US attempt to ’defeat’ the IMO climate framework, and President Trump has routinely exempted the US from discussions on international climate pacts, including twice withdrawing the US from a foundational United Nations climate change framework plan, the Paris Agreement.

On the other side of the debate, national shipowners’ groups from major shipping countries including Singapore, Japan, Norway, the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium penned their own letter in support of the adoption of the IMO net-zero carbon framework.

Amid far-reaching Russian claims that the new route is a greener and more efficient solution to existing shipping routes, researchers continue to illuminate flaws and ignored nuances in the Russian narrative.

A recent study published in Nature Communications by Pengjun Zhao, Yunlin Li, Caixia Zhang and co-authors examines how the opening of Arctic shipping routes is set to reshape not just the global shipping traffic, but global carbon emissions. The research points to possible environmental advantages from shorter routes, but also reveals hidden risks that complicate the promise of this new era in maritime trade.

The creation of the Northern Sea Route was made possible by significant reductions in Arctic sea ice in the warming region, allowing ships to traverse icy waters across Russia’s northern coast to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Russia has seized this opportunity to market the route as cheaper, faster, and lower-emissions compared with longer alternatives such as the Suez or Panama canals.

The study found that while the route is a significantly shorter alternative that does promise environmental benefits, there are a number of challenges and complexities that require further understanding and oversight.

Key Takeaways:

A Shorter Route Doesn’t Guarantee a Cleaner Route The Arctic shipping route can cut some journeys by up to 40%, particularly between Northern Europe and Northeast Asia, but efficiency gains may be offset by induced shipping demand and shifts in global fleet patterns.

Arctic Emissions Could Surge Maritime emissions within the Arctic could rise sharply, from 0.22% to as much as 2.72% of global shipping emissions, creating a new climate hotspot.

Heavy Emitters Set to Dominate Oil, gas, and chemical tankers are expected to make up the bulk of NSR traffic, amplifying the carbon footprint of rerouted shipping flows.

Policy Matters More Than Distance Saved The study finds that relying on current IMO targets or Green Corridors only modestly reduces emissions. Only a robust Net-Zero strategy with cleaner fuels, caps, and regional implementation could fully offset added Arctic emissions.

Risks of Carbon Inequality Route shifts may concentrate emissions in specific areas while reducing them elsewhere, creating localized “hot spots” of pollution exposure.

Technological & Environmental Constraints Short-term fuel savings may be undermined by Arctic-specific challenges such as extreme weather, heavy fuel oils, spill risks, inadequate infrastructure, and regulatory gaps.",https://www.arctictoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/19790888415_8d7484fc2b_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:09.230267

The framework will be included in a new Chapter 5 of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

The Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC E.2) in London on October 14-17 will consider formal adoption of the “Net-Zero Framework” – a comprehensive regulatory package aimed at achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by or around 2050.

“The global industry remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully this carefully balanced regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050,” stated leading international maritime associations in a joint statement released on October 9 from London.

The statement, backed by organizations representing the majority of the global shipping fleet, emphasized the critical nature of this regulatory framework: “With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field.”

The maritime transport sector, which moves 90% of global trade, has positioned itself as ready to “play its important part in delivering a sustainable future.”

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, initially approved during the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd session in April 2025, represents the first global regulatory system to combine mandatory emissions limits with greenhouse gas pricing across an entire industry sector. The framework will be included in a new Chapter 5 of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

Under the proposed regulations, ships will be required to comply with two key mechanisms: a global fuel standard that will require vessels to reduce their greenhouse gas fuel intensity over time, and a global economic measure that will establish a system of penalties and rewards based on emissions performance.

Specifically, ships that emit above set thresholds will need to acquire “remedial units” to balance their emissions deficit. This can be accomplished by transferring surplus units from other ships, using previously banked surplus units, or purchasing remedial units through contributions to a newly established IMO Net-Zero Fund.

This fund will be instrumental in supporting the industry’s transition, with revenues being used to reward low-emission ships, support innovation and research, fund training and technology transfer, and mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable states such as Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.

Industry leaders have emphasized the importance of global regulations, stating: “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

If adopted next week as expected, the amendments will likely enter into force in 2027, becoming mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which collectively emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

The adoption of this framework would represent a significant victory for climate diplomacy, particularly following the April 2025 agreement that was secured through a vote at the IMO. The shipping industry’s united support could be crucial for the framework’s successful implementation.

Key supporters of the framework are expected to include most BRICS nations, the EU27, Canada, UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Panama, and Chile.

Following the expected adoption of the legally-binding regulations next week, technical negotiations will continue during ISWG-GHG-20 (October 20-24) to finalize key details on the design and implementation of the framework. This will be followed by approval of detailed implementation guidelines at MEPC 84 in Spring 2026.

In his closing remarks at the April meeting, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez noted: “The approval of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI mandating the IMO net-zero framework represents another significant step in our collective efforts to combat climate change, to modernize shipping and demonstrates that IMO delivers on its commitments.”",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-11T050025Z_666471803_RC2G9V9UXH5H_RTRMADP_3_SHIPPING-EMISSIONS-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:13.244256

Schaefer,,,,,https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-looming-international-shipping-crisis,"A fight is brewing ahead of the upcoming meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry.
The dispute centers on draft amendments to the existing International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which the United States ratified in 1980 to address pollution of the marine environment by ships.
The IMO projects that the regulations could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 40 percent.
This is not a situation where the United States can simply vote “no” and walk away.
Other nations need to take the US opposition to the proposed IMO regulations seriously.","The UN’s net-zero push is coming to a head with the Trump administration efforts to revamp US shipping.

A fight is brewing ahead of the upcoming meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry. Formal approval at the October 14-17 meeting was assumed until the United States announced its opposition to the regulations in August and called on other governments to reject the proposal or face retaliation.

The IMO is an unlikely place for this confrontation. As a United Nations specialized agency focusing on setting universal standards for maritime safety and security, the IMO is rarely controversial. In fact, the IMO is one of only a handful of UN organizations identified in the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget request as deserving of US funding. Specifically, it was highlighted for its standards setting, efforts to reduce pollution and prevent maritime disasters, and enhancing US security by helping “secure shipping lanes against terrorism and related threats.”

Nonetheless, the IMO finds itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The dispute centers on draft amendments to the existing International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which the United States ratified in 1980 to address pollution of the marine environment by ships. The new rules, if approved in October, would be added to Annex VI of MARPOL and would apply to all parties to the agreement and annex 16 months after adoption through a process called “tacit acceptance.” The United States is a party to both MARPOL and Annex VI of the convention.

These regulations seek to implement the IMO “Net-Zero Framework” through mandatory fuel standards for ships over 5,000 gross tonnage and financial penalties for those failing to comply. Military and domestic shipping vessels are exempted. Overall, however, covered ships account for about 85 percent of global emissions from the shipping industry.

Under the proposal, ships must reduce their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used). Specifically, ships with emissions over two specified thresholds, which increase annually from 2028 to 2035, would be required to pay fines ($100 per ton of excess emissions over the first threshold and $380 per ton of excess emissions over the second) into an “IMO Net-Zero Fund.” Revenues would be used to reward ships with low emissions, support research and technology transfer, and help mitigate the impact of the regulations on vulnerable states.

What impact will the new regulations have? The most recent IMO study found that shipping accounted for 2.89 percent of global anthropogenic emissions. The IMO projects that the regulations could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 40 percent. Thus, if everything works as planned, the regulations will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 percent.

But things may not go as planned.

The new regulations would take effect in 2027, giving ships a relatively short window to come into compliance. According to shipping firms, fines could amount to “about $20 billion to $30 billion a year by 2030,” with the cumulative total possibly exceeding “$300 billion by 2035 if the global fleet misses targets by as little as 10%.”

The financial penalties are intended to incentivize compliance. However, the costs of compliance are even steeper. Over 90 percent of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Retrofitting existing ships is expensive, and some may choose to pay the fines instead.

In addition to retrofitting ships, infrastructure also needs to be overhauled, including investments related to new alternative green fuel production and refitting ports for storage and bunkering. According to one estimate, “To meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2050 emission targets, the scale of investment is estimated to be up to $1.9tn.”

Finally, there is the fact that alternative green fuels cost far more—at least three to four times more—than traditional fuels. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350 percent.

Overall, whether shippers comply or simply pay fines, the cost of shipping is likely to increase if the IMO regulations are implemented, and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.

The United States is opposed to these measures, which it sees as “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization” to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets” that will drive up costs. The United States is also concerned that the rules would phase out proven technologies like liquified natural gas and biofuels in favor of alternative fuels, including ammonia and methanol, where China has an advantage.

The United States warned that it “will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists…and [will] not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies” should the IMO adopt these rules. It subsequently clarified that these remedies could include “tariffs, visa restrictions, and port levies.”

Will the IMO adopt the new regulations despite US pressure? The draft was easily approved by a vote of 63 to 16 with 24 abstentions at a meeting of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee this past April. But 63 nations are only a third of all 176 IMO member states. In the upcoming October vote, there could be enough opposition to block the regulations or convince governments to consider changes.

This is not a situation where the United States can simply vote “no” and walk away.

US vessels are subject to inspection for compliance with MARPOL in foreign ports. Amendments to Annex VI, where these new regulations would be inserted, would similarly apply. Thus, the United States will be affected even if it votes against the new regulations. Hence, the threat of retaliation. If the other governments approve the new IMO regulations, they could invite reciprocal fees or inspections on foreign ships at US ports.

In addition, through its ratification of MARPOL and a subsequent Memorandum of Understanding, which “provides that EPA and USCG will jointly and cooperatively enforce the provisions of Annex VI,” the United States likely will have obligations to comply with the new regulations even if it opposes them. Depending on the level of US opposition, it may decide to withdraw from MARPOL or Annex VI, which would take effect 12 months after a notice of denunciation is communicated to the IMO Secretary-General. This could undermine existing IMO standards more broadly.

Relatedly, the European Union has enacted fuel and emissions standards similar to those under consideration at the IMO. Now that the United States has staked its position, if the EU enforces those regulations on US ships, it could trigger a response like that threatened if the new IMO regulations are adopted.

Other nations need to take the US opposition to the proposed IMO regulations seriously. The administration has demonstrated that it is willing to be disruptive and impose the trade measures it threatens. An off-ramp or alternative to address US concerns while preserving preexisting rules and relationships is the prudent course.

‘Binding global regulation’

“The industry supports the Net-Zero Framework,” commented Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping. “Binding global regulation is crucial to achieving the goal of climate-neutral shipping by 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field.

“The alternative to the Net-Zero Framework is not no regulation, as some of the agreement’s opponents may hope, but rather a complicated patchwork of regional and national regulations – and that is completely wrong for a global industry.”

The seven associations also called on the EU, which currently has the most ambitious climate targets for shipping, to send a ‘clear signal of adherence’ to the IMO’s NZF when it is adopted, in order to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce regulatory pressure.

Elsewhere, other maritime groups such as the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) have also issued statements in support of the NZF.

‘Strengthen the incentive’

“The adoption of the Net-Zero Framework will strengthen the incentive to reduce emissions and invest in sustainable energy, fuels and technology,” Steffensen added.

“It will also send the strongest possible signal to investors and manufacturers to scale up production of the alternative fuels that shipping will need to move towards zero emissions.”

Danish Shipping represents more than 90 members, including shipping and offshore companies, and is part of Blue Denmark, the country’s maritime cluster. Read more here and here.

The market was valued at $17.6 billion in 2020.

The report highlights Singapore’s continuing dominance as a global bunkering hub, supported by its strategic location, heavy shipping traffic, and compliance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.

Bunker fuel refers to the oil used in marine vessels, including heavy and low sulfur fuel oils and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The IMO-2020 regulation, which limits sulfur content in marine fuel to 0.5%, has driven demand for low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO).

High sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) remains in use for ships equipped with scrubbers, while others have shifted to LSFO to meet regulatory standards.

Key growth factors cited in the report include increased seaborne trade across Asia-Pacific, expanding offshore oil and gas exploration, and wider adoption of LNG as a cleaner marine fuel.

However, high infrastructure costs and rising competition from emerging Asia-Pacific bunkering hubs present ongoing challenges.

By type, LSFO accounted for 72.16% of the market in 2020, driven by regulatory changes. Among distributors, oil majors held the largest share at 40.63%, followed by large independent distributors with 34.47%, the latter projected to grow at 3.9% CAGR.

Container ships represented the leading application segment with 23.14% share in 2020, while gas tankers are forecast to grow fastest at 4.1% CAGR.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in bunker fuel demand in 2020 due to reduced shipping traffic and lower oil prices.

According to the International Energy Agency, global fuel oil demand for marine bunkering and power generation fell by 6.3%.

Demand for very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) fluctuated due to supply disruptions, while HSFO consumption dropped significantly.

Major companies active in the Singapore bunker fuel market include BP Plc., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services Pte. Ltd., Glencore Singapore Pte. Ltd., PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell Plc., Sentek Marine & Trading Pte. Ltd., SK Energy International Singapore Pte. Ltd., Total Energies, and Vitol Marine Fuels Pte. Ltd. Other players include Chevron Singapore, Global Energy Trading, Eng Hua Company, and Maersk Oil Trading Singapore.

Allied Market Research projects that Singapore will maintain its global leadership in bunkering through 2030, supported by LNG infrastructure investments and sustained container and tanker demand.

In a joint statement, the associations — including Danish Shipping, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), and the European Shipowners (ECSA) — warned that failure to adopt the NZF would leave the industry facing a fragmented system of regional climate rules.

“The industry supports the Net-Zero Framework. Binding global regulation is essential for achieving the goal of climate neutral shipping in 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field,” said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping.

The NZF is based on the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy adopted in 2023 and includes mechanisms for emission reductions, penalties for non-compliance, and incentives for the use of alternative fuels under a global fuel standard.

Final approval of the agreement requires a qualified majority of IMO member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention.

The associations also called on the European Union to align its existing regulations with the IMO framework to avoid overlapping compliance costs for shipping companies.

“Adoption of the Net-Zero Framework will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology,” Steffensen said.

Supporters argue that this framework finally brings fairness, predictability, and accountability to a fragmented industry long dependent on voluntary commitments..
Between ambition and practicality The IMO’s plan walks a tightrope between climate ambition and commercial reality..
The debate over the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is not just about carbon..
The only real question is whether the industry will learn to sail with it or keep fighting against the current..","In July 2023 at its MEPC80 meeting, the International Maritime Organization (IMO)‘s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) – which sets environmental policy for global shipping – unveiled its revised greenhouse-gas strategy to steer global shipping toward net-zero emissions by or around 2050..

For an industry responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, this was the first clear signal that the age of unregulated maritime carbon was ending and was hailed as a historic milestone..

However, of late, there have been a few objections, murmurs, and outright name-calling about the IMO’s emerging Net Zero Framework, including the US Department of State which called it a “global carbon tax” and “an environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.“

Recently, in September, a few Greek shipowners, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While this MAY BE expected from the USA, who ironically only account for less than 0.5% of the world’s merchant fleet, such commentary from Greek shipowners who own 20% of the world’s merchant fleet gives others pause for concern.. So what actually is the issue here..??

What exactly is the IMO’s Net Zero Framework..??

The IMO is the United Nations agency that sets the rules for international shipping.. Its 2023 strategy marked a turning point, upgrading its 2018 target of “50% reduction by 2050” to a net-zero commitment by mid-century..

To move from promise to practice, the organisation developed the Net Zero Framework, a global system of carbon accountability for shipping..

It combines emission-reduction standards, lifecycle fuel assessments, and most controversially, a carbon pricing mechanism.. Ships that exceed set limits will pay into a climate fund, while those that outperform the targets can earn credits..

The framework takes a well-to-wake approach, measuring emissions from the entire fuel cycle – production, transport, and use.. Implementation is slated to begin around 2027, focusing first on the largest ocean-going vessels that generate most emissions..

Supporters argue that this framework finally brings fairness, predictability, and accountability to a fragmented industry long dependent on voluntary commitments..

The rationale behind the plan

Those backing the IMO’s framework believe that only global coordination can ensure meaningful change.. By setting uniform targets and penalties, the system prevents regulatory patchwork, where some nations enforce strict standards while others pretend not to notice..

It also sends a powerful message to shipowners, financiers, and fuel suppliers: the era of cheap, dirty fuel is ending.. Clear regulation gives investors the confidence to back new fuels like green ammonia or e-methanol, knowing they will not be undercut by competitors ignoring the rules..

In short, advocates see the Net Zero Framework not as punishment but as a long-term insurance policy, protecting the industry’s relevance in a low-carbon world..

Why some shipowners are pushing back

That optimism, however, is not universally shared..

Greek shipowners, who control roughly 20 percent of the world’s merchant fleet, have become some of the most vocal critics.. Their concern is not with the goal, few deny the need to decarbonise, but with the speed and practicality of the plan..

They argue that cleaner fuels are still prohibitively expensive and in short supply, and that imposing carbon costs before alternatives are viable risks driving smaller players out of business.. In their view, the IMO is asking the industry to jump before building the bridge..

Seatrade Maritime News is reporting George Procopiou, chairman of Dynacom Tankers as saying “the regulators are making shipping into “a tax collector” fleecing the industry with the false hope of decarbonisation.”

They also raise the question of equity.. Many developing economies rely on affordable maritime transport to sustain trade.. If shipping costs rise sharply due to carbon pricing, it could hit the poorest countries hardest, especially those far from major markets..

Unless the proposed carbon fund is used transparently to assist such nations, the framework risks widening global inequalities rather than closing them..

Between ambition and practicality

The IMO’s plan walks a tightrope between climate ambition and commercial reality.. The technology to achieve full decarbonisation, from green fuels to global bunkering infrastructure, remains in its infancy.. The challenge is not intent, but execution..

For the framework to work, it must blend regulation with realism.. It needs robust financial mechanisms, fair distribution of carbon revenues, and clear incentives for early movers.. Without these, the initiative risks becoming a paper victory that fuels resentment rather than progress..

The way forward

Despite the protests, political and commercial, one fact is unavoidable: global shipping cannot delay its energy transition forever.. With over 80% of world trade moving by sea, the sector’s emissions are too significant to ignore..

The debate over the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is not just about carbon.. It is about who bears the cost, who captures the opportunity, and who steers the transition..

The U.S. may not have many ships on the water, but it certainly has plenty of opinions.. Greek shipowners may not like the rules, but they know that change is inevitable.. Between them lies the truth, the need for bold ambition guided by pragmatic implementation..

Whether the resistance comes from Capitol Hill or the port of Piraeus, the tide of change has already turned.. The only real question is whether the industry will learn to sail with it or keep fighting against the current..",https://www.shippingandfreightresource.com/wp-content/uploads/Explainer-Article-IMO-Net-Zero.webp,N,,2025-10-09 15:57:19.151852

Biofuels have emerged as the dominant choice for decarbonisation, with 62 per cent of companies adopting them as part of their transition strategy.

Meanwhile, interest in green hydrogen and ammonia is also growing, with 25 per cent and 19 per cent of respondents respectively identifying them as future alternative fuels.

The findings were presented by Michalis Ierides, secretary-general of the Cyprus Marine Environment Protection Association (CYMEPA), as part of the ongoing international five-year project Metavasea.

Ierides explained that the project aims to promote a human-centred transition for the maritime sector towards carbon reduction through education, training, and collaboration among all stakeholders.

The Metavasea programme is coordinated by the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association (Helmepa), with the support of the Lloyd’s Register Foundation.

It also involves key partners, such as CYMEPA, the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute (CMMI), the World Maritime University (WMU), the Mediterranean Information Office for Environment, Culture and Sustainable Development (MIO-ECSDE), and other organisations.

According to the survey results, the main barriers to achieving decarbonisation include high costs, ship compatibility, technological immaturity, and the complexity of the regulatory framework.

Moreover, 64 per cent of seafarers stated that they have not received any training related to decarbonisation in the past two years.

The survey also highlighted growing concern over crew fatigue, with 70 per cent of seafarers identifying it as the most serious safety issue.

From the perspective of ports and civil society, the findings revealed that despite progress, infrastructure for low-carbon fuels remains limited.

Only 20 per cent of ports currently offer refuelling services with Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO), while 40 per cent plan to implement Onshore Power Systems (OPS), and another 40 per cent have yet to plan any intervention.

In addition, environmental awareness in coastal communities remains high, with 97 per cent of citizens expressing concern about the effects of climate change on their local environment.

The survey also found that public perception tends to overestimate the maritime sector’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, with many believing it to be significantly higher than its actual share of just 3 per cent.

Ierides said that the green transition of shipping is not only a technological issue but also primarily a human one.

“We are investing in the skills, safety, and environmental awareness of all those connected to the sea,” he said.

“The participation of citizens is crucial, as their views help us design a transition that is realistic, safe, and people-centred,” he added.

As part of the project, CYMEPA has invited all stakeholders (including seafarers, maritime professionals, port workers, students, and citizens) to participate in the online Metavasea questionnaire.

At MEPC/ES.2 on 14-17 October, the IMO will formally consider adopting this regulation. For this edition, MMMCZCS examines what compliance is expected to entail, assuming regulatory enforcement begins in January 2028.

Why this matters

According to the article’s authors, Elvi Heng, Secondee, Rio Tinto and Ignatios Papoutsis, Secondee, V. Group with the IMO Net-Zero Framework (IMO NZF) expected to enter into force in March 2027, understanding how the compliance process works is the first step to building an effective compliance strategy. Familiarity with this process enables companies to implement appropriate data collection systems, establish roles and responsibilities, and develop strategies that can lower emissions as well as compliance costs.

Who will need to comply with the IMO NZF?

According to the current draft text for the IMO NZF, ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or above will need to comply with the Framework. Exclusions include ships operating solely in their flag State’s waters, vessels not mechanically propelled, and platforms including FPSOs, FSUs, drilling rigs, and semi-submersibles. For this edition, references to ‘ships’ should be considered as those covered by the regulation.

Understanding the IMO NZF compliance cycle

#1 Reporting period

The calendar year in which the emissions intensity is regulated. This is the period where companies need to collect emissions intensity data. The first reporting period for the IMO NZF is 2028.

#2 Verification period

We refer to the year following the reporting period as the “verification period.” In this period, companies will need to submit information to the flag State, also known as the “Administration.” In addition, any under-compliant vessels will need to manage compliance deficits using either Surplus Units (SUs) or Remedial Units (RUs). The first verification period will be 2029.

#3 Pre-reporting period

We refer to the year prior to the reporting period as the “pre-reporting period.” In this period, companies must complete certain administrative tasks to prepare for reporting. The first pre-reporting period will be 2027.

Activities in the pre-reporting period

GFI Registry account setup: By 1 October 2027, each ship will need to have an account for the IMO GFI Registry. This occurs only once, although new ships that enter into service will also need to set up an account. The GFI Registry is a system that enables recording of ships’ GFI-related transactions. The registry will be established and administered by the IMO.

SEEMP update and verification: After the regulation enters into force in March 2027, but before 1 January 2028, ships will need to update their Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) with the following information:

Methodology for collecting data required for calculating the ship’s attained annual GFI, target annual GFI, and compliance balance

Processes used to report data to the flag State

The updated SEEMP will need to be verified by the flag State, at which point the flag State will issue a Confirmation of Compliance no later than 31 December 2027. The Confirmation of Compliance should be retained on board the ship.

Preparation for compliance approach: Companies that intend to comply with the IMO NZF by using low-emissions fuels, zero- and near-zero GHG fuels (ZNZs), or SUs will need to prepare early. For example, companies can explore whether low-emissions fuels or ZNZs will be available for bunkering at the relevant ports, or whether SUs will be available for purchase.

Activities in the reporting period

Shipping bodies have urged governments to adopt the IMO's Net-Zero Framework, arguing global rules are essential to avoid fragmented regional regulation.

The maritime groups have reiterated their commitment to committed to working with IMO member states to implement the package, as per the emailed joint statement shared on Thursday.

IBIA, European Shipowners, WSC and ICS are among the maritime organizations that are backing the framework's adoption.

""Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry,"" they said.

""Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.""

The statement described the upcoming IMO meeting as a 'historic opportunity' to establish enforceable global rules that ensure a level playing field.

""With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry's transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field,"" the organisations said.

Framework Background

The Net-Zero Framework was agreed in April and will now be put to a formal vote for adoption during next week's second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).

Supporters include the EU, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Panama, and BRICS members such as China and India, which appear to have voted in favour of the agreement at MEPC 83 in April.

On the other hand, the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have opposed its adoption. The US has reportedly gone so far as to warn other member states of retaliatory measures against supporting the framework.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_29819eec1079df7788aadd34ec1ae9b5.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 09:56:08.921732

Inclusivity is invaluable for dealing with challenges we all share.

This year’s WISTA International AGM and Conference takes place in Barcelona just a week after the IMO MEPC’s meeting is scheduled to adopt its Net Zero Framework. Hopefully, by the time we gather, we will have greater clarity on how mechanisms for implementing new regulations that are of profound consequences will work.

The theme of our conference, ‘Powering the future of shipping & trade: Global energy in challenging times’ reflects the way that the world, including shipping, needs to find ways to move toward lower carbon fuels.

Today, it remains difficult to forecast which fuels and technologies will work best, while the cost and availability of each alternative is still hard to predict.

The options include biofuels, ammonia, methanol, hydrogen-fuel cells, electric batteries, wind assistance and, now even nuclear power - once regulated.

Many of these fuels will require the adoption of renewable electricity generation to ensure their production makes them greener than fossil fuels, while other technologies such as carbon capture are also likely to play a part.

Costly retrofitting or building new vessels, further investment in fuel production, and new infrastructure across the bunkering and ports sectors – all of these are still required. Furthermore, the need for training will be paramount, so that the seagoing workforce works safely with fuels that have different characteristics and the marine environment is protected from risk.

But none of the alternatives have been either fully proven or are available at scale, and no single clear winner seems likely: instead, a range of fuels will be required, with various technologies working with each other to serve the market’s decarbonisation needs as a whole.

When asked what they most like about their jobs, one of the most frequently given answers by those working in maritime is that they enjoy the international dimension and collaborating with other cultures from across the world. Working together, those is shipping know, is essential for getting the job done.

And when people from different backgrounds come together – whether what separates them is gender, nationality, culture, technical or creative approach, their pooled abilities tend to be the most fertile source of new and innovative ideas.

We also know that the increasing need to overcome environmental challenges and rising digitalisation will mean shipping has to compete to attract new types of workers - the researchers, developers, analysts, engineers and other experts we need for the sustainable future.

Implementing inclusivity is a powerful way that shipping can attract that broader pool of talent – by pressing home its advantage as the type of culturally diverse, global industry that younger people want to work in.

And if it is a tautology to suggest that more minds thinking differently result in more creative solutions, study after study also shows that more diverse workforces often enjoy better collaboration and a greater willingness to try new approaches.

Moreover, employers that show flexibility in their approach are more likely to anticipate regulatory, social, legal or other potential risks, and so build loyalty and resilience into the organisation.

In turn, organisations can be rewarded with improved reputational capital with regulators, customers and communities and help inspire the next generation of potential joiners: hard to measure, these gains are nonetheless crucial for filling future skill needs.

History teaches us that making progress requires hard work. I would remind you therefore, that no matter what the political weather looks like, now is not the moment for retreat. Whilst shipping is making significant strides towards a greener future, maintaining this trajectory depends on continuously driving the narrative of sustainable progress.

And, while we celebrate our achievements to date, we do so mindful of the fact that – whether the theme is sustainability or inclusivity - they did not happen by chance.

As I said at WISTA International’s Mid-Term Meeting in India in April, it has taken many, many years of collaboration to create today’s global maritime community. By all working together, women can help shipping drive positive changes that will benefit our industry and the global community.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/blte9ff603c30d1acda/68e79bcb9ebb3ddcc23a60b0/Elpi-Petraki.JPG?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:32.664226

A two-day Nuclear Energy Maritime Organization (NEMO) event that took place at LR’s headquarters in early October focused on bridging the regulatory gap between nuclear and maritime security-by-design framework. The workshop was the second event of the series – ‘Safeguards, Security and Safety’ – organised by NEMO and will continue in 2026.

While the International Maritime Organization (IMO) governs international shipping, the IAEA is focused on land-based nuclear safety, security, and non-proliferation, leaving a grey area that must be filled to allow maritime nuclear to become a reality.

Inaugural NEMO chair Dr. Mamdouh el-Shanawany, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Assessment Section and former Nuclear Director at LR, explained, “To achieve nuclear energy at sea , we need to find a way through maritime regulations under the IMO and nuclear requirements under the IAEA , and this workshop gives us an important first step to achieving this.”

The IMO’s technical officer Andrew Clarke and project officer Mara Luciano explained the IMO’s approach, with specific reference to SOLAS chapter XI-2 and ISPS code requirements, which were developed in response to the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise liner, and updated following the 9/11 attacks. These set clear responsibilities in the event of a maritime incident.

Pete Rucinski, Chief Standards Officer at the International Maritime Cyber Security Organization (IMCSO) explained the growing threats to maritime organisations from cyber threats and the measures organisations need to take to meet those threats. Jonathan Dodd, Operational Security and Resilience Senior Manager at Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) described the threats at port.

IAEA’s Head, Nuclear Security of Materials and Facilities Section, Heather Looney and Robert Officer, Head of Nuclear Security Unit ran through the international regulations and requirements for nuclear security and in particular the principle of nuclear security by design.

There are existing areas of overlap between maritime and nuclear security, and sea captain Simon Chaplain from the World Nuclear Transport Institute (WNTI) offered a model from existing Nuclear Transport Systems (NTS) voyages.

NTS use specially designed ships to transport a range of nuclear materials up to and including the highest classification Category 1 over long distances. While much can be learned from their extremely stringent and robust security measures used by NTS, delegates agreed these were unlikely to apply to nuclear propelled ships of the future which were more likely to fall into a lesser Category of material in their fuel inventories.

Finally, the event featured a group exercise to examine the voyage of a hypothetical nuclear LNG carrier, and what measures would be taken over a series of imaginary security threats of increasing severity.

What emerged is that many of the measures that would be taken in response to threats against a nuclear ship do not differ significantly from those that would be taken against any conventional ship threatened in the high seas today.

Mark Tipping, LR's Global Power to X Director said, 'The regulatory underpinnings of maritime nuclear are essential to get right because they will allow maritime vessels to operate globally to maximise zero emission benefits. NEMO is best placed to navigate a route through global regulations and enable maritime nuclear deployments now that 4th generation small modular reactors (SMRs), which have so many safety by design features built in, are a reality'.""

The security measures introduced since 1985 have evolved to be relevant for today’s maritime challenges, and can further evolve to meet tomorrow’s, and that route will be plotted in more detail in further exercises and outputs from NEMO.",https://www.lr.org/contentassets/e7e72a769da3495899cef62bdeb2e87e/pxl_20251003_115133504-1-v2-web-v3.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 09:56:17.440440

The adoption of the measures is subject to a two-thirds majority vote by member states of the IMO at the Extraordinary meeting of MEPC being held from 14 – 17 October.

The organisations characterised themselves as the “global shipping industry” however there were some notable absences – Intertanko, Intercargo, and Bimco – three out of four members of the so-called Roundtable of Shipping Organisations.

The statement from the seven organisations read: “The global industry remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully this carefully balanced regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050, with necessary incentives to de-risk investment in new green marine fuels to accelerate the total decarbonisation of international shipping and to implement a just transition for the maritime workforce.”

A somewhat more measured view is being put forward by independent tanker owners association Intertanko, which called on the NZF to provide certainty and support for all transitional pathways in shipping's journey to decarbonisation. Intertanko agrees with the other seven organisations over the importance of global regulation but differs on the pathway.

Emma Scheiris, Deputy Director - Environment at Intertanko said: “We need reassurance that all transitional pathways remain in place for the long-term shift to zero- and near-zero fuels.

""The debate has become polarised, and this is a point that we are seeking to address. There is an opportunity for a more measured and balanced approach. The success of the NZF hinges on its ability to robustly, pragmatically and unambiguously overcome significant roadblocks.

""The framework must support the full spectrum of pathways, from energy-saving devices like wind propulsion to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuels, and net-zero technologies, including shore power and carbon capture,” she stated.

There has been particular concern from some in the industry over the potential penalisation of LNG as a fuel, a view first expressed publicly recently by classification society ABS and followed by many major shipowners.

Bimco said it supported the IMO's GHG strategy but did not mention the framework explicitly.

Despite these increases, signatories highlighted progress in operational efficiency and emissions intensity reduction at the vessel level. External factors, such as disruptions in global supply chains and rerouted voyages due to geopolitical events, contributed to the overall rise in emissions.

It can be blended with traditional marine fuels to reduce or eliminate penalties under the escalating GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets that were set in the regulation.
Two of the most widely used versions of biodiesel are fatty acid methyl esther (FAME) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).
“OEMs confirmed the engine and hardware compatibility with long-term B24 use” This resulted in an impressive reduction in CO2 emissions during the voyage.
Solstad estimated the vessel saved “more than 95%” of the 1,600 tonnes of CO2 emissions generated with normal speed and “fuel down to 71-t CO2 (net GHG emissions).”","While biofuels are expensive and contain carbon, they offer an immediate solution to help shipowners cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing vessels with conventional engine technology.

This drop-in benefit is particularly relevant given the other, more expensive, choices to comply with IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, which was approved at MEPC 83 in April. This has led to an increasing number of pilot projects using various blends of biodiesel.

But all the same questions that surround other alternative fuels - availability, scalability and price - plague biofuels, too. And in the case of biodiesel, the question will be if maritime can compete with other transport sectors for the limited supply.

But biodiesel is still intriguing for shipping. It can be blended with traditional marine fuels to reduce or eliminate penalties under the escalating GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets that were set in the regulation. By blending biodiesel, owners can meet regulatory compliance targets, or bank surplus remedial units for trading or future use. The cost of using biodiesel would have to be balanced against the potential penalties, or the market for trading surplus units.

This year’s DNV Maritime Forecast to 2050 examines the viability of biofuels, with sections exploring potential costs, and considerations around their operational and technical limits. Two of the most widely used versions of biodiesel are fatty acid methyl esther (FAME) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).

As explained by DNV: “FAME, often called biodiesel, is made from fats, oils, and greases (FOGs) through transesterification, and its exact characteristics depend on the feedstock.

“HVO, or renewable diesel, is produced from FOGs via hydrotreatment, resulting in paraffinic hydrocarbons suitable for most current fuel systems and engines. The fuel properties differ among biofuel products and blend ratios.”

HVO use

Owners across the spectrum – from tugs to tankers – are increasingly piloting biofuels. Earlier this year, Norwegian OSV owner Solstad tested certified HVO in Normand Ferking during the 2007-built anchor-handling tug supply (AHTS) vessel’s transit from Husøya on the west coast of Norway to Rio de Janeiro “to demonstrate that existing measures can effectively cut emissions.”

Propulsion power for the diesel-electric-powered AHTS is normally supplied by four Wärtsilä 8L32 medium-speed engines.

During the transit, the crew focused on saving fuel “by reducing speed and operating with a single engine,” explained Solstad in a social media post.

“OEMs confirmed the engine and hardware compatibility with long-term B24 use”

This resulted in an impressive reduction in CO2 emissions during the voyage. Solstad estimated the vessel saved “more than 95%” of the 1,600 tonnes of CO2 emissions generated with normal speed and “fuel down to 71-t CO2 (net GHG emissions).”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/Lambert_Maru_source_MOLwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-10-09 09:56:50.693091

“The adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would be a major milestone for global climate regulation,” the associations declared in a joint statement released this week.
“Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change,” said the signatories.
“Beyond compliance, this is about establishing a framework that enables the maritime industry to accelerate toward zero-GHG shipping.” But not everyone is onboard.
“Achieving IMO’s net zero targets would become impossible.” Adding to the tension, the US remains firmly opposed to the framework.","As the IMO prepares to decide shipping’s most consequential climate measure in decades, a rare show of unity from leading shipowner associations faces opposition from the likes of John Fredriksen, Greek giants, leading class societies and Washington.

With days to go before the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) extraordinary session on the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a deep rift has emerged across the shipping industry.

Seven leading shipowner associations – from Japan, Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands and Singapore – have just issued a joint appeal urging governments to “make history in London” by approving the global decarbonisation plan — even as powerful opposition gathers from some of the sector’s most influential players.

“The adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would be a major milestone for global climate regulation,” the associations declared in a joint statement released this week. “Anything else would be a major setback for the green transition and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations.”

The statement argues that the IMO’s framework — years in the making — is essential to provide predictability for investors and to scale up production of alternative fuels.

“Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change,” said the signatories.

“The alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks that would derail the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition.”

The framework, due for a final vote next week, would set a global carbon levy and fuel standard aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. It would also establish a central Net Zero Fund to reward compliance and finance green infrastructure.

While backing the framework’s ambition, global tanker organisation INTERTANKO this week called for a more measured approach to implementation.

“The framework will create certainty, allowing shipowners and operators to focus on operational feasibility without the burden of regional unpredictability,” said Emma Scheiris, INTERTANKO’s deputy director for environment.

Scheiris warned, however, that the debate had become “polarised” and that the IMO must ensure “all transitional pathways remain in place for the long-term shift to zero- and near-zero fuels.”

She listed several unresolved technical hurdles: the absence of a global sustainable fuels certification scheme, the need for sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, and clear crediting for non-fuel energy sources such as wind propulsion.

“While maintaining the Polluter Pays principle, we need to provide the required investment security to unlock capital for a decarbonised future,” Scheiris said. “Beyond compliance, this is about establishing a framework that enables the maritime industry to accelerate toward zero-GHG shipping.”

But not everyone is onboard. A powerful bloc of major shipowners — including John Fredriksen’s Frontline, George Economou’s TMS Group, Evangelos Marinakis’s Capital Maritime, the Angelicoussis Group, and Saudi state carrier Bahri — has come out against the deal in its current form, warning it could “impose excessive financial burdens on the industry and consumers.”

The opposition, coordinated during London International Shipping Week last month, also includes Dynacom, GasLog, Seapeak, and Stolt Tankers. Together, they represent a significant share of the global tanker and gas carrier fleet.

“As it stands, we do not believe the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonising the maritime industry nor ensure a level playing field as intended,” the group stated, calling for “critical amendments” before adoption.

Greek shipping minister Vassilis Kikilias echoed their concerns, telling IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez in London that “changes are essential” before the framework can be accepted.

Dominguez, however, struck a confident tone at the same event. “I remain convinced the framework will be adopted,” he told delegates. “I base that on the track record of the organisation, on the co-operation that we all have, and the understanding that we still have some challenges and concerns.”

The IMO rarely resorts to formal voting, but sources in London say a ballot looks increasingly likely. If consensus cannot be reached, adoption will require a two-thirds majority — 108 of the 176 member states that have ratified MARPOL Annex VI.

The Getting to Zero Coalition, representing more than 180 companies and several of the world’s largest shipowners, last month issued a statement calling on member states to adopt the framework without delay.

“Prolonged uncertainty could put very large investments — ones that will be critical for the future of global trade — at risk,” the coalition said. “The absence of global regulatory guidance will raise the costs of change in the long run — costs that the industry, countries, and consumers will bear.”

Patrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), also urged IMO members to seize the moment.

“A failure to adopt the framework would create absolute investment uncertainty,” Verhoeven warned. “Achieving IMO’s net zero targets would become impossible.”

Adding to the tension, the US remains firmly opposed to the framework. Washington walked out of April’s MEPC session and has since warned that countries supporting the deal could face retaliatory measures ranging from tariffs to port levies and visa restrictions.

Analysts say the vote could hinge on a small number of undecided states — including several from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America — where political and economic alignments are in flux.

Designed guide shipping toward net-zero emissions by 2050, the IMO’s could reshape fuel choices, costs, and operations across the maritime sector, with project cargo logistics squarely in the spotlight.

The NZF introduces two central mechanisms: binding emission standards covering the full lifecycle of marine fuels, and a global carbon levy for vessels exceeding decarbonization targets. The levy, set at a minimum of $100 per ton of CO₂, will fund the transition to cleaner fuels, reward low-emission ships, and assist developing nations in decarbonizing their fleets.

The framework, approved in principle earlier this year, is expected to enter into force in 2027, with implementation beginning 1 January 2028.

Industry stakeholders watching

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee will be debating the issue between 14 and 17 October, and industry stakeholders are watching closely. The Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners (KNVR) has endorsed the NZF, citing its potential to make clean fuels economically viable and accelerate the sector’s fuel transition.

Over 180 companies in the global shipping industry, coordinated through the Getting to Zero Coalition, have called on IMO member states to adopt the framework, warning that delay or rejection could disrupt the path to sustainable shipping.

Nick Lurkin, Senior Adviser Climate & Environment to the KNVR, says the combination of the decision-making process within and beyond the IMO, along with the broader geopolitical context, makes this meeting an extraordinary one.

“Beyond that, the IMO Net-Zero Framework has the potential to be a transformative development for global shipping, both in terms of emission reduction and its impact on the business models of shipping companies,” he says.

By 2030, biofuels are anticipated to produce 70 MtCO₂e more than fossil fuels, which translates to the annual emissions of almost 30 million diesel cars.

That same land used for the manufacturing of biofuels, however, could reportedly feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of the land for solar panels could create the same amount of energy, the report said.

Given this massive loss of land and the stark numbers, particularly since biofuel demand is expected to rise by at least 40% by 2030, T&E has called for global stakeholders, those from the maritime industry included, to “limit the expansion of a climate solution that is doing more harm than good.”

“Biofuels are a terrible climate solution and a staggering waste of land, food and millions in subsidies. Ensuring a sustainable balance between agriculture and nature is essential to tackling the climate crisis,” Cian Delaney, biofuels campaigner at T&E, commented.

As T&E has noted, in spite of advanced and waste biofuels being promoted more and more as cleaner solutions, 90% of global production of these alternative fuels still relies on food crops.

Moreover, T&E’s analysis has stressed that biofuel crops require significant amounts of freshwater, putting increasing pressure on water supplies and, by extension, endangering the global climate neutrality goals, especially the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

For the maritime industry specifically, Transport & Environment has already warned about the potential dangers of using biofuels as a path toward net zero. Even though numerous shipping players have set their sights on biofuels for their fleet(s), such as Norden, Oldendorff, CBH Group, Taiwan’s Yang Ming Marine Transportation and others, others have taken a wait-and-see approach.

T&E revealed in a different report (also done by Cerulogy) that by 2030, a third of global maritime transport could run on biofuels.

The organization had spotlighted that, although waste biofuels like used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats have garnered plenty of attention from shipping players, including giants like Switzerland’s MSC and France’s CMA CGM, they are unlikely to cover more than a small proportion of shipping’s projected demand as their availability is limited.

Maritime energy demand forecast

DNV forecasts the maritime sector will cut its CO2 emissions by 77% by 2050. While not fully ‘net-zero by or around 2050’, as per the goal of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime looks set to decarbonize faster than all other transport subsectors. This abatement arises from a levelling off in demand for maritime transport from the 2030s, more efficient shipping, and a transition to low-GHG fuels and onboard CCS driven by the IMO’ s Net-Zero Framework (NZF), approved in April 2025 (IMO, 2025).

According to the report, efficiency measures like slow steaming, AI routing and wind-assisted propulsion will drive decarbonization. Fuel diversification is also underway, LNG is already in use; biofuels will reach 4% market share by 2030, followed by e-methanol (2037) and ammonia (2039).

Onboard carbon capture is expected to handle 4% of fossil fuel emissions by 2042. Nuclear propulsion may gain traction in the 2050s. Full details are available in DNV’s Maritime Forecast reports.

Plateauing demand for shipping

Total demand for maritime transport in tonne-miles will grow by 10% by 2030, but will then plateau before slowly declining back to today’s levels (Figure 2.11). This decoupling from global GDP, which is set to double by 2060, separates the maritime sector from all other transport subsectors. There are multiple contributing factors to this effect.

Ships mainly transport physical goods, not passengers or services. Future growth of the global economy will steadily become more service oriented: the economy will grow more than the production and shipping of goods (UNCTAD, 2024).

Additionally, some production will be home-shored and some supply chains will become more localized, reducing the need for shipping of produced goods. This is being done to increase self-sufficiency and cut costs from more expensive fuels. On the other hand, recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine have disrupted trade patterns, leading to increased shipping distances, for example, for Russian oil.

Breaking it down into the separate shipping segments, today, fossil cargo makes up one third of shipped goods. The transition to renewables will reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels, and thereby the need to ship them, starting in 2030.

However, the share of seaborne natural gas will temporarily increase significantly due to energy security and supply-demand patterns. Gas trade will almost double from today to 2040, before starting to decline.

In contrast, container shipping will continue to grow, thanks to increased containerization and a growing economy. Non-coal bulk and other cargo will also grow, albeit to a lesser extent. The sum of non-fossil shipping will plateau in the 2050s, up about 25% from today.

SMR technology is often promoted as the next generation of nuclear power

Small modular reactors (SMRs) used for direct propulsion on ships potentially offer a long-term energy solution compared with costly biofuels and e-fuels. However, significant technological, commercial, and regulatory challenges mean that nuclear in shipping only scales from 2045 in the forecast, though it accounts for 10% of the maritime fuel mix by 2060.

Future fuels for hard-to-electrify sectors

Sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and long-haul trucking require energy dense fuels for long-distance travel. Fossil fuels provide a level of energy density that current and expected battery technologies cannot match.

Alternative liquid and gaseous fuels will emerge: Biofuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), will grow in the near term and are expected to constitute around 25% of the maritime and aviation fuel mix by 2060.

In the long term, hydrogen and its derivatives, like ammonia, will be critical. They are projected to power 10% to 35% of hard to electrify sectors such as aviation and maritime by 2060. The concept of onboard carbon capture is also being explored in shipping, and is forecast to capture 100 Mt of CO2 annually by 2060.

Hydrogen demand

Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen derivatives will be central to decarbonizing international shipping. EU measures are already reshaping the sector: the Emissions Trading System (ETS) has applied to large ships since January 2024, with full allowance surrender from 2027, and FuelEU Maritime introduces penalties for not meeting well-to-wake GHG requirements from January 2025.

Globally, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) updated GHG Strategy — reinforced in 2025 with new emissions caps and carbon pricing plans — is adding further pressure to adopt zero- or near-zero- GHG fuels and technologies. These policies are boosting demand for hydrogen derivatives, but large-scale uptake will hinge on lower production costs, robust lifecycle emissions verification, and expanded port infrastructure.

Electrification will remain limited to shore power at berth and short-range operations such as ferries. This leaves hydrogen-based fuels — notably ammonia and e-fuels — as the dominant zero-emission options by 2060. DNV projects e-fuels, mainly e-methanol, to account for 100 PJ (1% of the fuel mix) by 2030, 800 PJ (6%) by 2040, and 1,500 PJ (14%) by 2060.

Ammonia, while costlier to produce, can use much of the existing infrastructure and benefits from relatively simple CO2 capture when made from natural gas. This makes low-carbon ammonia the leading candidate in our long-term forecast, surpassing e-methanol in the overall fuel mix, at 21% and 14% respectively.

DNV expects toxicity concerns will be resolved, enabling large-scale trade from low-cost production regions to global bunkering hubs. Furthermore, DNV forecasts uptake at 10 PJ (0.1%) by 2030, 700 PJ (5%) by 2040, and 2,300 PJ (21%) by 2060, with faster growth in later decades as biogenic CO2 for e-methanol becomes harder to source.

While significant, these volumes fall short of the IMO’s decarbonization pathway. Although ammonia combustion is carbon-free, it produces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions which contributes to air pollution and causes significant environmental and health impacts. However, this can be effectively mitigated through advanced engine and emissions-control technologies.

The turning point for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has arrived

Capture and storage capacity expected to quadruple by 2030. After 2030, growth in hard-to-decarbonize sectors will accelerate, with CCS deployment in manufacturing rising nearly ten-fold and making up about 25% of all captured emissions by mid-century.

CCS will grow to capture 6% of global CO2 emissions in 2050, falling significantly short of what is required for any net-zero outcome. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will capture 610 MtCO2 in 2050 — 38% of total captured emissions.

Bioenergy’s rise

Biofuel is already used in maritime transport by blending biofuels with fossil. Its use will grow steadily from a very low volume to reach a 5% share in 2030. By 2060 bioenergy will be the biggest non-fossil energy source in the sector, supplying 26% (3 EJ/yr) of total maritime demand. At this level, it surpasses the remaining use of fossil fuels (25%).

Net-zero emissions in our forecast is only achieved towards the end of this century, and the accumulation of emissions until then takes us beyond 2°C of warming by 2100. Science has shown beyond any doubt that humanity will then be experiencing, to its great cost, how critical each tenth of a degree of global warming is to our planet and society.

For some, division and divisiveness seem to have become a strategic position but, as an industry that brings together people from around the world, shipping has always thrived through collaboration. Inclusivity is invaluable for dealing with challenges we all share.

This year’s WISTA International AGM and Conference takes place in Barcelona just a week after the IMO MEPC’s meeting is scheduled to adopt its Net Zero Framework. Hopefully, by the time we gather, we will have greater clarity on how mechanisms for implementing new regulations that are of profound consequences will work.

The theme of our conference, ‘Powering the future of shipping & trade: Global energy in challenging times’ reflects the way that the world, including shipping, needs to find ways to move toward lower carbon fuels.

Today, it remains difficult to forecast which fuels and technologies will work best, while the cost and availability of each alternative is still hard to predict. The options include biofuels, ammonia, methanol, hydrogen-fuel cells, electric batteries, wind assistance and, now even nuclear power - once regulated.

Many of these fuels will require the adoption of renewable electricity generation to ensure their production makes them greener than fossil fuels, while other technologies such as carbon capture are also likely to play a part.

Costly retrofitting or building new vessels, further investment in fuel production, and new infrastructure across the bunkering and ports sectors – all of these are still required. Furthermore, the need for training will be paramount, so that the seagoing workforce works safely with fuels that have different characteristics and the marine environment is protected from risk.

But none of the alternatives have been either fully proven or are available at scale, and no single clear winner seems likely: instead, a range of fuels will be required, with various technologies working with each other to serve the market’s decarbonization needs as a whole.

When asked what they most like about their jobs, one of the most frequently given answers by those working in maritime is that they enjoy the international dimension and collaborating with other cultures from across the world. Working together, those is shipping know, is essential for getting the job done.

And when people from different backgrounds come together – whether what separates them is gender, nationality, culture, technical or creative approach, their pooled abilities tend to be the most fertile source of new and innovative ideas.

We also know that the increasing need to overcome environmental challenges and rising digitalization will mean shipping has to compete to attract new types of workers - the researchers, developers, analysts, engineers and other experts we need for the sustainable future.

Implementing inclusivity is a powerful way that shipping can attract that broader pool of talent – by pressing home its advantage as the type of culturally diverse, global industry that younger people want to work in.

And if it is a tautology to suggest that more minds thinking differently result in more creative solutions, study after study also shows that more diverse workforces often enjoy better collaboration and a greater willingness to try new approaches.

Moreover, employers that show flexibility in their approach are more likely to anticipate regulatory, social, legal or other potential risks, and so build loyalty and resilience into the organization.

In turn, organizations can be rewarded with improved reputational capital with regulators, customers and communities and help inspire the next generation of potential joiners: hard to measure, these gains are nonetheless crucial for filling future skill needs.

History teaches us that making progress requires hard work. I would remind you, therefore, that no matter what the political weather looks like, now is not the moment for retreat. Whilst shipping is making significant strides towards a greener future, maintaining this trajectory depends on continuously driving the narrative of sustainable progress.

And, while we celebrate our achievements to date, we do so mindful of the fact that – whether the theme is sustainability or inclusivity - they did not happen by chance.

As I said at WISTA International’s Mid-Term Meeting in India in April, it has taken many, many years of collaboration to create today’s global maritime community.

By John Ioannou

As this year’s Cyprus Maritime Conference kicks off, the global shipping industry faces no shortage of risks and rewards, opportunities and threats. Geopolitical turmoil, decarbonisation efforts and industry consolidation are key forces shaping the future. Cyprus, as the largest third-party ship management centre in the European Union and one of the top three globally, plays a pivotal role in the maritime sector – yet remains vulnerable to external shocks.

The Trump administration’s erratic tariff policy may offer short-term gains for freight carriers, as businesses accelerate pre-orders to hedge against looming price rises, but this surge could be short-lived. Analysts anticipate economic downturns in both Europe and the US next year, with freight earnings likely to be impacted as consumers feel the squeeze of tariff-driven inflation.

Key EU economies are already slowing sharply and face further headwinds. German manufacturing for instance, has lost access to cheap Russian gas and is now committed to buying $750 billion worth of costly US energy products over the next three years. This huge surge in fuel shipping presents opportunities for some carriers but will increase carbon emissions as the industry struggles to meet the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) climate targets. Meanwhile, fears of a debt crisis are mounting as US borrowing surpasses $37 trillion.

A potential default would eclipse the shock of the 2008 financial crisis, reverberating for decades as the world economy tries to rebalance.

Wars in Ukraine and Middle East also continue to rage, while other flashpoints – such as Venezuela – simmer dangerously. Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June was reportedly halted by US intervention after Tehran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would have disrupted vital shipping routes through the Persian Gulf and sent energy prices soaring. In the absence of effective diplomacy and amid a growing disregard for international law, it is difficult to see these conflicts de-escalating anytime soon.

Nevertheless, the biggest challenge facing the maritime industry is decarbonisation.

Under the IMO’s Net Zero framework, shipping aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, yet major bottlenecks persist in the availability and scalability of alternative fuels and propulsion systems to replace hydrocarbons. Shipowners have already borne the high cost of retrofitting carbon scrubbers to comply with IMO sulphur emission regulations, and there’s no end in sight to these regulatory-driven expenses. Any newly built vessels will now need to be low-carbon by design, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) has emerged as the leading choice for new ship orders. In 2024 alone, over 260 LNG-fuelled vessels were ordered – more than double the previous year – making up a significant share of the global orderbook. LNG is widely considered a transition fuel: while not carbon-neutral, it offers lower emissions and compatibility with existing infrastructure, helping bridge the gap until more sustainable solutions become viable. These future alternatives may include synthetic fuels, electric propulsion for smaller coastal vessels and even nuclear power.

The enormous challenges of net zero is becoming increasingly apparent, with leading industry figures questioning the feasibility of targets they view as unrealistic. Christopher Wiernicki, CEO and chairman of American Bureau of Shipping – the leading classification society for US-flagged tonnage – recently voiced these concerns: “Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard,” he said.

“The industry needs a framework, but we need one that marries ambition with reality”. Wiernicki believes shipping is being pushed toward alternative fuels when they are simply not available in large enough volumes to run the world’s fleet. “The IMO needs to pause and rethink to get this right. There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability, and infrastructure support” he said.

In Europe, Wiernicki’s statements were echoed by DNV Maritime’s CEO Knut Orbeck-Nilssen in their ‘Forecast to 2050’ report, where he called for a more realistic approach and greater clarity around LNG’s future acceptance to mitigate risks for shipowners who have already invested heavily in LNG as part of their decarbonisation strategies. Striking a pessimistic tone, he suggests that many owners will simply be unable to meet the requirements. “Owners will probably just sail and pay, as the alternatives are not that easily obtainable” he said, referring to the heavy penalties firms could incur for falling short of decarbonisation targets.

The high cost of compliance with IMO’s Net Zero Framework has triggered a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as maritime firms seek economies of scale to absorb rising regulatory expenses. The industry has also attracted growing interest from private equity and venture capital, with funds acquiring family-owned assets and consolidating them into diversified fleets. Armed with huge pools of unallocated capital – or ‘dry powder’ – these investors are targeting undervalued assets with potential for operational improvement. In a highly fragmented sector dominated by smaller shipowners, ageing vessels, and under-capitalised operators, overcapacity has long suppressed margins.

Now, with increasingly complex and costly environmental regulations, many smaller owners find themselves unable to keep pace – creating a steady supply of willing sellers. Moreover, second-generation shipowners, often less committed than their predecessors to the volatile business of vessel operations, are divesting hard assets and moving toward more lucrative areas such as ship finance and brokering. The decline of family-owned firms and the rise of impersonal corporate HR practices has also had a disorienting effect on seafarers, deepening the crewing crisis and prompting many to abandon the profession entirely.

In Cyprus, the shipping cluster is evolving to meet the demands of a decarbonising industry. Limassol’s ‘Big Three’ – Bernhard Schulte (BSM), Colombia Group and Marlow Navigation – are actively adapting through a blend of low-carbon fuel adoption, digitalisation, and crew upskilling.

Under veteran CEO Ian Beveridge, BSM is investing in low carbon technologies with recent orders of Liquid Carbon Dioxide (LCO₂) tankers. These vessels, equipped with wind-assisted rotor sails and air lubrication systems, are expected to achieve a carbon footprint approximately 34 per cent lower than conventional ships powered by traditional marine fuels.

BSM has also placed orders for LNG dual-fuel car carriers from Mitsubishi Shipyards, reinforcing its commitment to transitional fuel technologies. In parallel, the company recently launched its Fleet Performance Centre (FPC) – a specialised department comprised of senior mariners, naval architects, engineers and data analysts. “FPC is designed to optimise vessel performance and drive decarbonisation by improving voyage efficiency, environmental sustainability and compliance,” said Beveridge in a recent release.

Columbia Shipmanagement is following a similar trajectory, having acquired EmissionsLink – an onboard platform designed to streamline emissions management and ensure compliance with the IMO’s Net Zero Framework. Columbia is also investing in crew upskilling, with expanded training programmes focused on practical competencies for operating dual-fuel vessels.

Likewise, Marlow Navigation is preparing its crew for low-carbon technologies through strategic investments in United Maritime, its training centre in the Philippines. In collaboration with Denmark’s Green Marine – specialists in maritime transition solutions – Marlow now offers specialised training in methanol dual-fuel technology. Green Marine has constructed a fully operational dual-fuel diesel methanol engine room at United Maritime, complete with the auxiliary machinery found onboard vessels. This facility is unique in the Philippines and among only a handful worldwide.

Smaller players in the Cyprus cluster may struggle to meet the challenges of regulation, but one family-owned firm is weathering the storm with resilience and vision.

Mastermind Shipmanagement, still owned and operated by the Adami family, has begun renewing its fleet with an ambitious series of 43,000-ton vessels from Huanghai Shipyard, marking a significant milestone in its expansion strategy. These newbuilds feature advanced energy-efficiency systems and emissions-reducing technologies, aligning with global sustainability standards. Mastermind is also investing heavily in cadet training through its innovative ‘floating university’ – a seagoing school that operates alongside its commercial fleet. This people-centric approach is attracting experienced seafarers seeking stability and purpose in an increasingly corporate maritime landscape.

Looking ahead, Cyprus shipping will continue to confront many of the same structural challenges, with an ongoing need for evolution, resilience and strategic adaptability. Consolidation is likely to continue, favouring larger players who have the scale and resources to absorb the rising cost of decarbonisation. As such, a bigger role will be played by private equity, with the further disappearance of family owned firms and increased corporatisation. Global geopolitical instability is also unlikely to abate, and with the Trump administration still in the first year of its term, the potential for further economic turmoil is high.

And yet, there may be some tailwinds. Decarbonisation targets could be reassessed as the high cost of net zero becomes apparent, giving owners some much needed breathing space, and the move away from US hegemony and toward multipolarity will give rise to new trade blocs and corridors such the Belt and Road initiative, BRICS expansion, and African Continental Free Trade Area. Maritime routes and port investments are already reflecting this shift, with growing emphasis on South-South trade, and improved infrastructure in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The maritime industry is no stranger to storms, and while the seas ahead may be choppy, they’re not uncharted. The sector has weathered wars, oil crises, regulatory upheavals and technological revolutions before, and with a proven track record of problem solving and innovation, is well positioned to tackle today’s challenges and remain a key player in shaping the next economic era.

“This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region.","The leaders of seven shipping associations called for International Maritime Organization (IMO) adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) at the crucial vote in October, according to a joint statement on Wednesday (8 October).

The statement said anything else would be a major setback for the green transition and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations.

The statement was signed by leaders of the Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and Danish Shipping.

“This October, the member states of the International Maritime Organization can make history by finally adopting an agreement on climate regulation of the shipping industry – and thus becoming the first global industry to do so,” the associations said.

“As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.”

The backstory is as follows: In 2023, IMO agreed on a greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy stating that global shipping must become climate neutral around 2050. This was followed earlier this year by the principal agreement on the regulatory framework necessary to make the ambitious GHG-strategy a reality. This Net-Zero Framework must now be finally adopted at the IMO-meeting in London in mid-October.

The associations said the Net-Zero Framework entails concrete mandates for the reduction of emissions from ships as well as a pricing mechanism that puts a cost on undercompliance and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard.

They added that these are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions. Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology.

“Final approval at the IMO meeting requires a qualified majority of member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention. It is important that such a majority comes together to shepherd the agreement across the finish line. Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change,” the associations said.

“The alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks. Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition.”

“We therefore also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.”

To deliver on the agreed upon GHG strategy, the group said global regulation is a precondition.

“It is necessary for reducing emissions, for creating homogeneous and predictable framework conditions for the shipping industry and – perhaps most importantly – sending the strongest possible signal to investors and producers to scale up the production of the alternative fuels that the shipping industry will require to move towards zero emissions.”

“The industry supports the IMO Net-Zero Framework, as evidenced by the formal declaration of support of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the clear support of the European Shipowners (ES | ECSA). The co-signers of this article appeal to the IMO member states to come together and vote for global climate measures.”

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Captain Rahul Choudhuri, IBIA Board Member & IBIA Asia Regional Board Chair, and President of Strategic Partnerships at VPS, sat down with bunkering publication Manifold Times to offer his take on future challenges of the marine fuels sector.

MT: Heading into IMO 2030, what are the challenges of maintaining bunker fuel quality for safety despite an increasing array of alternative marine fuels? Is the ISO 8217 marine fuel standard enough for end users?

The shipping industry, with 20% of users still on the outdated & withdrawn ISO 8217:2005 edition, is certainly ‘change-averse’. Bunker buyers want a cheaper product [e.g. ISO 8217:2005] but they also need to be aware this is a poorer quality product line.

This slow adoption means the benefits of the new and much improved ISO 8217:2024, which also addresses biofuels for the first time, are not being realised. It’s like a dilemma and a curse and if every new version of an ISO 8217 standard, which is supposed to improve quality and safety, is not really going to be used ultimately the shipping industry will have to pay the price.

And the worst nightmare is when the ship faces engine damage, loses propulsion, stops in midocean and is drifting for several days. This is still happening today and poses a very high safety of life risk.

Another part of ISO 8217 development is that because of the way it is conducted, there are many countries representation involved with necessary compromises when the standard is finally completed.

For example, the latest ISO 8217:2024 standard does not consider biofuel issues such as microbial activity, cold flow, stability, chemical contamination etc.

In contrast, the new Biofuels Standard in Singapore TR140 launched early this year is more comprehensive & covers Biofuels quality more holistically, including future new feedstocks.

To address risks not covered by standard tests, VPS launched the Additional Protection Service for Biofuels testing(APS-BIO) three years ago. This service provides additional protection by testing for a wider range of issues in biofuels, aiming to provide a comprehensive quality control of biofuels that are used for shipping.

MT: Have marine fuel testing labs been able to catch up with risk management of bunker consumption in relation to the evolution of changing bio feedstocks?

Acknowledging the slow adoption of latest ISO 8217 marine fuel standards, VPS has developed a risk management plan for shipowners consuming biofuel bunkers by testing for additional parameters covering Energy Content, Renewable Content, Stability, Cold-Flow Properties, Corrosivity, Microbial Activity & Chemical Contamination. This is part of the APS-BIO package mentioned earlier.

There’s a lot of work that VPS has done in understanding new types of bio feed stock. For example, Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) is now a ‘hot topic’ in certain regions, and we know this is a sustainable feedstock which in principle can benefit the circular economy.

Based on our experience, some CNSL blends have been used without any issues while others have caused engine damage problems, like fuel sludging, injector failure, filter clogging, etc.

So, there is a need for risk management here in how you use such biofuels. What is important is to take proactive measures and do the necessary tests including by blending them into small portions while submitting samples to the lab. More advanced tests like the Fuel Combustion Analyser can be a useful tool as well.

Interestingly, certain blends of CNSL show better ignition & combustion characteristics when blended with Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) when compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This is an example of the benefit by employing risk management and understanding the types of biofuels consumed.

MT: Has the role and challenges of the bunker surveyor changed in the era of MFM, digitalisation and zero carbon/green fuels?

When we look at bunker survey, it is essentially a subset of marine surveying that has been there since the advent of shipping. The primary role of a surveyor is really based on ‘trust but verify’ and that concept is what the surveyor is doing whether it is in bunkering or marine surveying or cargo inspection – so that is here to stay.

But in the context of MFM, the role is changing and for example the surveyor needs to now ensure compliance to ISO 22192 [Bunkering of marine fuel using the Coriolis MFM system] so there is a technologist direction that surveyors need to adopt as well.

The role of the bunker surveyor will be even more important with future alternative marine fuels (such as Methanol) where the level of safety is higher. The types of measurement & sampling are different so in a way the surveyor is moving up the value chain and that must be managed in the industry with proper training etc., and I think those that succeed will be at the forefront of future surveying.

For example, about two years ago there was a methanol bunker delivery in Singapore. VPS was appointed by not only the shipowner but also the product owner. One must be aware that when you do complex fuels like methanol, other parties who operate on a different mindset want to be involved and are interested in this type of product surveying control.

MT: Moving forward, can you forecast the changing role of bunker fuel testing labs past (pre-IMO 2020) and present leading into IMO 2030?

There are several formal studies done which shows the best-case scenario up to 2050 still includes about 50% fossil fuel for global consumption with the rest being taken up with renewable and green fuels. That’s the best case.

I think fossil fuels are here to stay for some time and managing these will continue to be key work for laboratories and testing agencies. Issues such as high Al+Si (Catfines) are not only going away but increasing, and this means better operational control of purification systems onboard vessels.

From a lab point of view, future fuels offer an opportunity to value add at a different level as they are a much more complex and high-end type of products. Those laboratories who are willing to invest and take up positions in these new future marine fuels really will be the winners of tomorrow.

Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) on Tuesday (7 October) said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NH3 Clean Energy (NH3) and Oceania Marine Energy (Oceania) regarding the development of clean ammonia bunkering operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The MoU is to promote collaboration with NH3 and Oceania on the Pilbara Clean Fuels Bunkering Hub initiative, which is Australia’s first ammonia bunkering concept announced by the Pilbara Ports Authority in June this year. MOL will be the world’s first ocean-going shipping company to participate in this initiative.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to the world’s largest iron ore export port and serves as a major port of call for Capesize bulkers.

The Pilbara Ports Authority has entered into a joint development agreement with NH3, which will supply blue ammonia, and Oceania, which will operate the bunkering business, to realize low-carbon ammonia bunkering in the region.

Their goal is to commence bunkering operations for Capesize bulkers at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland by 2030.

This MoU aims for MOL, NH3, and Oceania to collaborate on the transition of iron ore carriers in the Pilbara region to ammonia fuel and the realisation of the WAH2 project.

The WAH2 Project is NH3’s flagship project to supply low-emissions ammonia to the decarbonising powerhouse economies of the Asia Pacific, including Japan and South Korea as well as being a source of decarbonised bunker fuel for powering bulk carriers carrying iron ore from Australia to Asia.

The trio will also jointly propose solutions to Western Australian iron ore suppliers and work to address issues such as safety in ammonia bunkering operations.

MOL will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH NV, which are scheduled to be delivered by China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between 2026 and 2027. These vessels will be chartered by MOL.

MOL is looking to establish a fleet of ammonia duel-fuelled capesize bulk carriers on the West Australia to East Asia trade route and ensure safe ammonia bunkering operations and consider the procurement of ammonia.

As an operator of ammonia dual-fuel vessels, MOL will work for this project to advance considerations regarding safety assurance and ammonia procurement in the Pilbara region.

MOL’s Managing Executive Officer Kazuhiro Takahashi, commented: “We are honored to sign this MoU with NH3 and Oceania today, which will be a vital hub for our ammonia dual-fueled capesize bulkers scheduled to commence operations from 2026.

“This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region. By working closely with our partners, we look forward to building a robust framework for safe ammonia bunkering and advancing sustainable shipping together.”

Against this backdrop, wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) enter the frame not as a silver bullet, but as a contributor in a diversified strategy.
But even if the decarbonisation of shipping doesn’t get fully locked into the regulatory framework, it will at some point.","Emmanuel Schalit, CEO of OceanWings, discusses some of the ramifications from the upcoming MEPC83 meeting, whether new amendments are adopted or not.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) could formalise its Net-Zero Framework, a new regulatory chapter in global shipping next week. If adopted at MEPC Extraordinary Session 2 (ES.2), this set of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI will hardwire decarbonisation targets into international maritime law, setting well-to-wake GHG fuel intensity (GFI) standards and compliance mechanisms that begin to take effect in 2027.

Shipowners could be required not only to report emissions more comprehensively but also to remain within strict fuel intensity thresholds or face financial penalties. The framework includes a system of compliance units, potentially tradeable, with overperformers earning credits and underperformers having to compensate. Renewable energy sources, including wind and solar, are explicitly recognised as contributors to reducing GFI.

For owners and operators, there is the potential for a material shift from best-effort, self-set efficiency targets to tangible economic pressure. In practice, this means that the propulsion strategy of every vessel, newbuilds and retrofits, will increasingly come under scrutiny, not only for technical performance but also for its compliance profile and exposure to fuel and emissions pricing, taxes, and fines. In short, the total cost of propulsion (fuel + penalties) for every vessel, which is often the number one expense for shipowners, is bound to go up materially in the next 5 years.

Against this backdrop, wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) enter the frame not as a silver bullet, but as a contributor in a diversified strategy. WAPS are maturing fast, in terms of deployment, seaworthiness and the quality of performance data. While fuel cells, synthetic fuels, and carbon capture attract many headlines, these options remain constrained by availability, infrastructure, and long-term cost uncertainties. WAPS, by contrast, operates on a known and free energy source. The primary challenge then, has been consistent integration and robust performance measurement.

The industry has made progress in addressing this. Methodologies such as those developed under the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) protocols aim to standardise how wind contribution is quantified, potentially smoothing the path to broader acceptance under regulatory schemes. Still, hurdles remain, ranging from the physical complexity and off-hire costs of retrofitting vessels, to alignment with class society requirements, to the variability of performance by route and vessel type.

The upcoming MEPC83 ES.2 meeting will be pivotal in shaping how wind technologies are treated under the compliance calculus. Clarity on methodology, crediting mechanisms, and verification processes will influence whether more owners choose to adopt wind as a compliance hedge. A clear, fair, and science-based framework will accelerate deployment; ambiguity will continue to stifle investment.

While there is still technological uncertainty, strategic direction should be forged at the earliest opportunity. Tens of thousands of vessels will likely require currently unplanned retrofits in the coming years, whether to install engines, fuel systems, digital tools, or wind-assisted technologies, in order to reduce their exposure to emissions costs. Manufacturing and installation capacity across many of these solution areas remains limited, and shipyard capacity is finite, meaning delayed action could eventually be more costly than moving early. Some operators are already taking the view that adopting emissions reduction measures now, especially creating a WAPS strategy, positions them more favourably for the regulatory landscape ahead.

There is no one-size-fits-all in the decarbonisation of shipping and over time many ships will operate on new, cleaner fuels and complimentary approaches like wind power. Each vessel type, trade lane, and operating profile presents a unique puzzle and as regulation begins to price emissions more directly, and as tools to quantify renewable energy sources’ contribution become more robust, wind-assisted propulsion is looking ready for the potential rush.

Whether or not the MEPC83 amendments become reality will be known soon. But even if the decarbonisation of shipping doesn’t get fully locked into the regulatory framework, it will at some point. So regardless of the outcome this month, the question for shipowners now is less whether to consider a formal strategy, and more whether they can afford not to move of their own accord.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ayro-Oceanwings.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 00:56:10.252259

The round was led by Twynam, with participation from MOL Switch, Hatch Blue, Clocktower Ventures, Idemitsu, and SGInnovate, Vycarb said in a statement.

The funding will enable the company to accelerate the commercialization of its novel water-based carbon storage technology.

“Vycarb’s approach aligns with SGInnovate’s mission to back innovative companies turning research into tangible solutions,

“With global demand for deployable, measurable carbon capture and storage technologies and Singapore’s goal of reaching net zero emissions, we are proud to support the Vycarb team as they scale their impact worldwide,” said Hsien-Hui Tong, Executive Director – Investments, SGInnovate.

Vycarb’s approach unlocks a new paradigm for industrial decarbonization, enabling distributed carbon dioxide (CO2) storage directly at the source, without the need for expensive purification, compression, or long-distance transport.

Its system takes CO2 from a range of sources, converting it into dissolved bicarbonate in natural waters, a stable and naturally abundant form of carbon storage, using readily available minerals.

This process permanently sequesters carbon for 10-100,000+ years and reduces acidification in surrounding waters.

Critically, Vycarb’s sensor-driven approach allows for real-time, in situ measurement of carbon capture, removal, and storage, meeting emerging standards for high-integrity carbon offset markets and helping close a key gap in the global decarbonization chain.

The Vycarb system can be integrated into bioenergy facilities, power plants, cement and steel facilities, and coastal ports, turning water infrastructure into a climate solution.

“Our mission is to make carbon capture and storage permanent, fully measurable, and scalable to address the urgency of the climate crisis,

“This investment enables us to further build our expert team and expand deployments at more sites worldwide, particularly where traditional carbon storage solutions are too expensive or infrastructure-intensive to be practical,” said Dr. Garrett Boudinot, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vycarb.

It is noted that Vycarb has already demonstrated its system in multiple field pilots, including a major deployment at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York City, where the company is permanently capturing and storing CO2 on the East River.

Working with partners including at depth, a leader in marine monitoring and verification, and TOMCO, an industry leader in CO2 management and utilization systems, Vycarb is proving its ability to cost-effectively store low-concentration CO2 emissions on-site using coastal or industrial waters.

“Decarbonizing industry at scale demands bold solutions and that’s exactly what Vycarb delivers,

“Their system is elegant, effective, and deeply aligned with our vision to remove and permanently store CO₂ at breakthrough unit economics,” said Johnny Kahlbetzer, Chief Executive Officer and Chair at Twynam.

Meanwhile, Tomoaki Ichida, Chief Executive Officer of MOL Switch, said MOL is exploring every possible avenue to achieve decarbonization across the maritime sectors.

“With global regulations such as those from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and European Union (EU) becoming increasingly stringent, Vycarb’s distributed carbon capture and storage technology could play a key role in enabling the shipping industry to directly mitigate emissions with minimal infrastructure,

“We are proud to back a company building real-world climate solutions from the ground—and water—up,” he added.

Ambika Rustagi, Corporate Venturing & CDR Associate, Idemitsu Americas Holdings, also said Vycarb’s ability to monitor and optimize carbon capture data in real-time combines the benefits of a closed-system technology with the flexibility to deploy in open-system bodies of water.

“Idemitsu is excited to support Vycarb’s development and scale-up of a low cost technology that will enable the carbon neutral future we are working toward,” she added.

The company has sold high-integrity carbon capture credits to leading buyers such as Stripe and Milkywire, and is a semifinalist in the U.S. Department of Energy’s landmark CDR purchase program.

In parallel, Vycarb received early investment from industry leaders like Rio Tinto and BluescopeX to support deployment at heavy-emitting facilities.

“Decarbonization is both an urgent challenge and a massive opportunity being pursued in major economies around the globe, but it requires technologies that are flexible, low-cost, and highly scalable in order to meet the needs of diverse markets, geographies, sectors,

“Vycarb’s solution offers the adaptability major industrial producers need across key sectors and the permanence and measurability needed to combat climate change,” said Josh Zoffer, Regeneration & Resilience Fund Lead at Clocktower Ventures.",https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-091002.png,N,,2025-10-08 22:56:08.553069

Danish Shipping along with six other shipping associations calls for the adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) have also issued declarations of support for the Net-Zero Framework.

“The industry supports the Net-Zero Framework. Binding global regulation is essential for achieving the goal of climate neutral shipping in 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field. The alternative to the Net-Zero Framework is not zero regulation, as some of the opponents of the agreement may wish for, but rather a complicated patchwork of regional and national regulations, which is entirely the wrong answer for a global industry,” said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping.

The authors of the joint statement also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.

The statement in full:

This October, the member states of the International Maritime Organization can make history by finally adopting an agreement on climate regulation of the shipping industry – and thus becoming the first global industry to do so.

As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.

The backstory is as follows: In 2023, IMO agreed on a greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy stating that global shipping must become climate neutral around 2050. This was followed earlier this year by the principal agreement on the regulatory framework necessary to make the ambitious GHG-strategy a reality. This Net-Zero Framework must now be finally adopted at the IMO-meeting in London in mid-October.

The Net-Zero Framework entails concrete mandates for the reduction of emissions from ships as well as a pricing mechanism that puts a cost on un­dercom­pli­an­ce and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard. These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions. Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology.

Final approval at the IMO meeting requires a qualified majority of member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention. It is important that such a majority comes together to shepherd the agreement across the finish line. Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change.

The alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks. Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition. We therefore also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.

To deliver on the agreed upon GHG strategy, global regulation is a precondition. It is necessary for reducing emissions, for creating homogeneous and predictable framework conditions for the shipping industry and – perhaps most importantly – sending the strongest possible signal to investors and producers to scale up the production of the alternative fuels that the shipping industry will require to move towards zero emissions.

The industry supports the IMO Net-Zero Framework, as evidenced by the formal declaration of support of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the clear support of the European Shipowners (ES | ECSA). The co-signers of this article appeal to the IMO member states to come together and vote for global climate measures.

Let’s take the next step and move towards net-zero together. Let’s make history in London.

Per MOL, the project—encompassing a six-year period from 2021 to 2026—initially aimed to reach a methane slip cut of 70% or more for LNG-powered ships.
The goal is said to have been for the endeavor to become the ‘first’ in the world to socially implement methane slip reduction technology in the maritime industry.
Known as the methane slip, this unburned methane is released through the exhaust, undermining the overall climate benefits of liquefied natural gas.","Japanese shipping giant Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and compatriot Kanadevia Corporation and Yanmar Power Solutions, part of diesel engine and machinery manufacturer Yanmar Holdings, have accomplished a ‘tremendous’ methane slip reduction from vessels powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) during recent onboard trials.

As disclosed, the three partners have managed to achieve a 98% methane slip slash during an effort governed under the Green Innovation Fund Project called “Development of next-generation vessels”. The initiative was reportedly led by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

Through this endeavor, MOL, Kanadevia and Yanmar Power Solutions will work to set up methane slip reduction technology at an early stage and actively contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector, the maritime transport company has said.

According to representatives from MOL, the three partners have specifically been working on a project named “Development of methane slip reduction technology for LNG-fueled vessels through catalyst and engine improvements”, as a part of which full-scale demonstration trials began in May 2025.

The routes that the endeavor examined were primarily between Japan and Australia, MOL said.

Per MOL, the project—encompassing a six-year period from 2021 to 2026—initially aimed to reach a methane slip cut of 70% or more for LNG-powered ships. The goal is said to have been for the endeavor to become the ‘first’ in the world to socially implement methane slip reduction technology in the maritime industry.

Officials from the Japanese shipping player have noted that the project has so far verified a reduction of 93.8% (at 100% load) in land-based trials, which has allegedly been verified by classification society Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (Class NK).

As informed, based on these tests, the trio modified the land-based trial equipment for onboard application. Starting in May this year, they began demonstration pilots in sea areas, including between Japan and Australia, using the LNG-powered large coal carrier Reimei, which is operated by MOL. The company had welcomed the ship back in 2023.

During the onboard investigation, while engines were being operated under ‘real-world’ conditions (subject to changing environmental factors in the engine rooms and fluctuations in the load rate due to weather conditions), it was shown that the system could accomplish the 98% reduction rate at the practical operation range (75% load), MOL has shared.

The company added that, moving forward, onboard trials are to continue until the end of next year in order to inspect the overall system performance and catalyst durability, with the overarching target being a social implementation from 2027 onward.

The burning question of methane

While LNG has become an increasingly attractive, cleaner alternative to heavy fuel oil due to its lower carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur oxide (SOx), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, a portion of the methane in LNG does not completely combust in the engine.

Known as the methane slip, this unburned methane is released through the exhaust, undermining the overall climate benefits of liquefied natural gas. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with estimates showing a global warming potential more than 80 times higher than CO2 over 20 years, reducing this pollutant is crucial to achieving genuine greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in shipping.

A major breakthrough in methane slip reduction technology was announced yesterday by Kanadevia Corporation, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and Yanmar Power Solutions. Full-scale demonstration trials conducted since May 2025 have achieved a remarkable 98% methane slip reduction rate in real-world conditions, far exceeding their initial 70% target. The trials are being conducted on the LNG-fueled coal carrier REIMEI, operated by MOL, on routes between Japan and Australia.

This development comes at a crucial time as SEA-LNG, the industry coalition supporting the methane decarbonization pathway, highlighted recent progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from LNG as a marine fuel ahead of next week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session at the UN International Maritime Organization.

“The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognizes the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway,” said Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG.

Landmark Study Reveals Lower Emissions for LNG Marine Fuel Than Previously Thought

With approximately 95% of vessels still using oil-based fuels, LNG has emerged as the leading alternative, now representing nearly 20% of the global vessel orderbook.

The technological breakthrough addresses one of the primary criticisms of LNG as a marine fuel—methane slip, which occurs when a portion of methane in LNG fuel is emitted into the atmosphere unburned. Methane has a higher greenhouse effect than CO2, making its reduction essential from the perspective of GHG reduction.

The project, funded under the Green Innovation Fund Project “Development of Next-Generation Vessels” led by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), combines methane oxidation catalysts with engine improvements. According to the developers, the technology achieved a 93.8% methane slip reduction rate in land-based trials, which has now been surpassed by the 98% reduction achieved in actual maritime operations at 75% load.

These developments align with SEA-LNG’s position that the LNG pathway offers immediate and future benefits. Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, noted: “Independent studies by Sphera and Rystad Energy confirm a steady decline in well-to-tank emissions from LNG over the past decade. With further reductions expected as supply chains evolve, and with LBM and e-methane scaling, the pathway is both credible today and vital for the industry’s long-term transition.”

The timing of these announcements is particularly relevant as the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) prepares to meet for its 2nd extraordinary session from October 14-17, at IMO Headquarters in London. The committee will consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 in April 2025.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework represents a significant shift in maritime regulations, featuring two key elements: a global fuel standard requiring ships to gradually reduce the GHG intensity of their fuels and a pricing mechanism with set prices on GHG emissions. If adopted, these regulations are expected to enter into force in March 2027.

Ship emissions under the framework are measured using GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI), which calculates greenhouse gas emissions for each unit of energy used, expressed in grams of CO? equivalent per megajoule. This “well-to-wake” approach covers emissions from the entire fuel lifecycle—from extraction and production to use onboard.

For LNG proponents, the advancements in methane slip reduction technology could significantly improve the fuel’s GHG Fuel Intensity profile. This comes as the framework defines “zero or near-zero” emission fuels (ZNZs) as those with a GFI of no more than 19.0 gCO?eq/MJ through 2035, after which the threshold tightens to 14.0 gCO?eq/MJ.

The Yanmar-led project aims to continue onboard trials through the end of FY2026 to evaluate overall system performance and catalyst durability, with the goal of social implementation from FY2027 onward—coinciding with the expected enforcement timeline of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

For the maritime industry, these developments suggest that LNG—with its established infrastructure and growing technological improvements—may continue to play a significant role in shipping’s decarbonization pathway, particularly as a transition fuel while other zero-emission technologies mature.

The question now facing industry and regulators is whether these technological advancements will be recognized within the IMO’s framework and how they might influence the trajectory of maritime decarbonization strategies as the industry navigates toward increasingly stringent emissions regulations.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Demonstration-vessel-REIMEI.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:56:52.206221

Part 1 addressed international policy and politics, Part 2 efficiency measures. This part looks at alternative fuels.

In mid-October, more than 100 nations will gather at a London meeting to decide whether to enshrine a set of carbon reduction rules into international shipping law. If they do, high-emitting conventional shipping fuels will be heavily penalized within a few years. But the rules don’t specify how they’re to be replaced; industry members would get to decide which low- and zero-carbon fuels to use instead.

And so, spurred largely by these pending global regulations, the race is on to develop alternative fuels and scale up their use. Shipping accounts for about 3% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, and activity is expected to rise in coming decades. Efficiency measures to reduce fuel use of any kind, such as in hull design, will help but aren’t anywhere near a complete solution.

“You’re not going to get to zero” with just efficiency, Lee Kindberg, former head of environment and sustainability for the North America division of Danish shipping giant A.P. Møller-Mærsk, often known simply as Maersk, told Mongabay.

“Think about moving this huge mountain of metal with all these boxes of cargo on top of it,” she added. “It takes a lot of energy to do that, so it’s going to take low-carbon fuels.”

Experts may disagree on the best alternative fuels, but they generally agree on which ones should be in the discussion. There are “bridge fuels” that could be used during a transition period or in a limited way for the long term, such as biofuels, and then there are options that are more sustainable at scale, such as green methanol and green ammonia.

Bridge fuels?

Alternative fuels are currently in limited use. More than 90% of the fuel burned on ships is an oil-derived marine fuel such as heavy fuel oil, which is a “bottom-of-the-barrel” derivative of the fossil fuel refining process.

The next most common fuel in current use, accounting for a small percentage, is in fact another fossil fuel: liquefied natural gas (LNG). Fossil-based LNG can emit roughly 20% less greenhouse gas than conventional fuels, but methane leaks can effectively undo the gains. New forms of LNG, such as bio-LNG, offer more savings, but only if the feedstock is sustainable, a caveat that applies to all biofuels. LNG, like many alternative fuels, requires a different engine than conventional fuels, so resources are required to make the switch.

Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, told Mongabay that fossil LNG has “absolutely no contribution” to make to decarbonization efforts and is a “dead end,” and that other forms of LNG are also bad options. He said one problem is that once shipping companies have invested in something like LNG, they tend to lobby for a regulatory system that continues to allow it.

“Money has power,” he said. “Once you’ve sunk capital into a molecule, you’re going to defend it to the hilt.”

Some biofuels do have a role to play as bridge fuels, experts generally agree. However, as with bio-LNG, the climate benefits they offer depend on where the feedstock comes from. Biofuels are controversial, and not just in shipping, because demand for them can spur land use change and raise food prices. For example, when forests are cleared or peatlands drained in Southeast Asia to grow oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), some of which goes to make biofuel. The problem exists elsewhere, as well.

“If you want to be hyperbolic, there’s a risk to burn the Amazon,” Felix Klann, a maritime transport policy officer at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based advocacy group, told Mongabay with regard to biofuel use.

Experts regard biofuels that come from waste-derived biomass, such as used cooking oil or agricultural residues, as more sustainable than “first-generation” biofuels that come from soy or corn. (They are especially skeptical of “renewable diesel,” which has been linked to deforestation in Brazil.) They say the main problem is scale: There is only so much waste-derived feedstock available.

Quantifying the full life cycle carbon emissions of biofuels, as with other fuels, is complicated. The text of the net-zero framework, which is the set of global regulations that could be adopted in mid-October by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. agency that oversees shipping, doesn’t fully specify how such life cycle assessments will be made. If the framework is adopted, technical discussions on these and other contentious issues remain to be completed.

Better long-term options

In recent years, Maersk has launched 17 cargo vessels that can run on green methanol, which is produced from non-fossil sources. The vessels have “dual fuel” engines that can also run on conventional fuels, as needed. Meanwhile, green methanol production facilities are coming online in Denmark and China.

Green methanol is a squishy term that generally refers to either “e-methanol” made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide or “bio-methanol,” a biofuel that can be produced from, for example, the anaerobic digestion of organic waste. (“E” because production of the hydrogen requires electricity.) Like other fuels, the degree of climate benefit offered by green methanol varies widely depending on how it’s produced. Some experts feel it’s generally a good option.

“I am betting on methanol, for the intermediate term, at least,” said Kindberg, who spoke as an independent expert, not on behalf of her former employer, Maersk. She said the future will involve multiple fuels.

“I don’t see really one fuel winning out,” she added.

For his part, Smith of UCL said methanol was not a good long-term option because of the amount of carbon required. The most sustainable way to source carbon is to suck it out of the atmosphere: direct air capture, as it’s called. Producing methanol this way — the only green methanol worth its name, in Smith’s view — virtually eliminates life cycle emissions if the production is powered by renewable energy. But scale is a challenge because direct air capture is an expensive, energy-intensive process, as carbon dioxide is very diffuse in the atmosphere.

Smith criticized Maersk for its investment in green methanol, saying it drew attention away from green ammonia, which his team’s research indicates is a better solution.

“They’ve distracted everyone with a molecule which is not a long-run solution and delayed the onset of ammonia,” Smith said of Maersk.

In response, a Maersk spokesperson whom the company did not name told Mongabay in an emailed statement that “we envision a future with multiple technological pathways.”

“No single fuel is likely to meet the diverse needs of global shipping, given diﬀerences in vessel types, routes, infrastructure availability, and regulatory frameworks,” the spokesperson said. “A portfolio approach, combining different low GHG [greenhouse gas] emission options, offers the flexibility to optimize emissions reductions, manage costs and mitigate the risk of lock-in to any one fuel.”

Maersk has indicated publicly that ammonia may be the best long-term option. Green ammonia contains no carbon, but rather nitrogen, which is easier and cheaper to source at scale. (E-methanol and green ammonia both require the production of hydrogen, a major energy and cost driver; bio-methanol can get its hydrogen from biomass feedstock, reducing that particular energy requirement.)

Price listings as of September 2025, adjusted for energy density, show that green ammonia is already slightly less expensive than green methanol; however, other associated costs such as storage could make ammonia more expensive to own in total. China and India have ramped up production of green ammonia using renewable energies, which could drive prices lower. Both green ammonia and green methanol are more than three times the cost of conventional fuels.

Jasper Verschuur, an assistant professor in engineering systems and climate security at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said green methanol is the most viable solution for the next 10-15 years, but green ammonia has the potential to “become the most viable longer-term solution.” He said his thinking was “fully in line” with a new report issued by the DNV, a Norway-based ship classification society, outlining ammonia’s pros and cons. He told Mongabay that even if green ammonia becomes widely produced, the shipping industry will have to compete with other industries for its use and may not be able to afford it without government support. He also said building up the infrastructure and supply chain for green ammonia would be hard.

There are relatively few ammonia-fueled vessels on the water today. However, dozens have been ordered and dozens more, including container ships and other types of vessels, are being made “ammonia ready” so they can be easily retrofitted to use the fuel later, according to the Ammonia Energy Association, a trade group.

This is a positive development, according to Agustin Valera Medina, co-director of the Net Zero Innovation Institute at Cardiff University in the U.K. He considers green ammonia to be the most promising alternative fuel.

“The reason is that you don’t have any CO2 in the molecule, and therefore, if you just burn it properly, the only thing that you get out is nitrogen and water,” he told Mongabay.

Still, it’s not without risks. Without proper design and controls, burning ammonia can emit nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, threatening local air quality, the ozone and the climate. And all experts who spoke to Mongabay agreed that the use of ammonia presents safety concerns, especially when vessels are at port. Ammonia, even more so than methanol, is highly toxic and corrosive and can cause severe respiratory damage if inhaled.

“You could kill people,” Kindberg said in explaining the stakes.

Ammonia has long been used in refrigeration and as a fertilizer feedstock, so there are well-established protocols for carrying it as cargo, and recent work has been done to prepare guidelines for its use as a marine fuel, including by the IMO.

Transition to any alternative fuels will involve design, retrofitting and storage costs. Port authorities will have to decide which fuels to stock as the fuel mix diversifies.

The fuel transition could come alongside other technological developments. Fuel cells could replace combustion engines for many fuels, especially those that contain hydrogen, while electrification and battery power could become more widely used for certain ship functions, especially at ports.

The rollout of alternative fuels does not depend entirely on the outcome of the London IMO meeting: There are national and regional regulations also driving change, most notably at the European Union level. But the transition would be weakened if the deal doesn’t go through, Smith of UCL said.

“[W]e would still see incentives creating energy transition, but not in as … coordinated and equitable [a] way as if [the] IMO drove the transition. And quite possibly as a result, not such a fast ramp-up [or] switch of energy,” Smith said in a text message.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit.","ABAKALIKI – In early September, African leaders convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Second Africa Climate Summit, which focused on overcoming the obstacles to climate-resilient development on the continent. In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action. As part of that process, they are increasingly recognizing that decarbonizing shipping – an industry that generates nearly 3% of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialization.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations’ maritime regulator. Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar. A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialization, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2% of global investment in renewables. But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless. Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments. If designed properly, the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit. Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/a6021a09b6dd07ed8793a73621e57b4a.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:12.917999

Mr Sbraga added: “What we have at the moment is a gradual shift in mindset towards what fuel is used for.
It also lets teams train on live kit without betting the business on a single fuel trajectory.","The seminar took the theme of The Fuel Landscape and attracted a high-calibre panel to lead the discussion on what the industry needs to do to meet Net Zero and the increasingly loud voices to switch vessels to more eco-friendly fuel sources.

Krystyna Tsochlas, Head of Maritime Transport Division at James Fisher & Sons Plc made the welcome and opening remarks; she was joined on the panel by Alessio Sbraga, Partner at HFW; Julia Harrowsmith, Head of Maritime Decarbonisation Policy at Department for Transport (DfT); Jacob Damgaard, Divisional Director, Head of Loss Prevention at Britannia P&I Club and Kenny English, Marine Engineer and LNG Consultant at Waves Group.

The panel and delegates left no stone unturned as they examined the vast array of issues arising from the subject.

They discussed the UK policy landscape including UK policy and developments at the IMO; the insurance perspective (impact of new emission rules, alternative fuels adoption, safety and spill concerns); the commercial and contractual view (regulatory pressures, challenges and opportunities in deploying low-carbon fuels) and technical and operational insights (adoption of dual-fuel technologies, comparative assessment of LNG, ammonia, hydrogen, and biofuels).

They also covered the intricacies of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which became the world’s first international emissions trading system in 2005.

This regulation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions for certain sectors, covering over three-quarters of the allowances traded on the international carbon market.

It was revised in 2023 to align with the EU’s climate targets, aiming for at least a 55% reduction in net emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

The panellists explained the challenges and opportunities in deploying low-carbon fuels, and how key a role shipping will play in the energy transition globally.

They discussed how dual-fuel technology would play a vital short-term role for maritime, while stating the increasing efficiency of vessels (with wind wings and air lubrication) would also make a valuable contribution.

On EU ETS, Mr Sbraga said: “It’s pushing the industry, I think, in small steps away from use of fossil fuel, and more towards exploring other types of low carbon-based fuels.”

Getting deep into the issue, the panel agreed that fuel was not just a means getting vessels from location to location, it plays a political role and has also changed the way ship managers and operators think and act.

Mr Sbraga added: “What we have at the moment is a gradual shift in mindset towards what fuel is used for. In the past, it was simply viewed as an operating cost, which has passed down the line. Now it has a different purpose; it can have regulatory benefits; it can even minimise exposure through the regulations that we’re seeing coming out at the moment.”

He continued: “People are making strategic choices now. The costs of carbon being passed through the physical transport chain is not only impacting freight and charter hires and business strategies but also fuel choices and decisions as to when it comes to new builds and the type of engines. It’s not easy.”

However the big question, of which alternative fuel would be the one to drive maritime into the future, is a difficult one to answer, the panel agreed.

Mr English said: “It’s clear that heavy fuel has not died yet. The future will really be a combination of fuels. Dual fuel will be the transition towards the transition.

“Why the rush to dual fuel? Optionality. It buys time for ports, suppliers and crews to catch up while protecting global tradability. It also lets teams train on live kit without betting the business on a single fuel trajectory. Gambling that the fuel ‘might be at the next port.”

He also talked about the need for qualified people who can handle these new fuels, saying: “Hardware often gets the budget; people determine outcomes. We’re short of experienced people: LNG competence remains scarce, and ammonia/methanol familiarity will lag demand for some time.”

Mr Damgaard added: “There are still a great deal of concerns around some of the fuel alternatives – ammonia is considered to be too dangerous, while methanol can burn without being seen.

“Spills are as big a concern as fuel costs; the thing with current fuels is that they can be handled visibly and be cleaned. Other fuels are unseen so that requires more expert help. These are things that shipowners need to add to their risk management. Added to that, the effect on nature in unknown.”

He emphasised said that equipping seafarers with the right skills and training to handle the new generation of fuels will also be a is a major issue as well moving forward.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Maritime-industry-still-debating-its-fuel-of-choice-for-the-future-experts-conclude-during-panel-discussion.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:29.373733

When a little-known UN agency meets in London this month to adopt a deal to cut shipping emissions, it will be up to governments to turn July’s groundbreaking ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) into concrete climate action.

For us, people living in small island states across Oceania, shipping is not a distant, abstract sector – it is our lifeline. Vessels bring medicine and food, while ensuring a connection with the rest of the world. But global shipping is also a major source of emissions, which the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a duty to address.

October’s IMO meeting is a critical test of whether countries will heed the ICJ ruling by embedding its principles into the Net-Zero Framework, a legally binding regulation that represents the world’s first truly global emission pricing mechanism.

In April, the IMO made world headlines when governments agreed the draft Framework after a long and painstaking negotiating process, and the agreement now needs to be formally adopted in October for it to enter into force in 2027.

Gaps and loopholes

Despite marking a huge achievement in global cooperation and multilateralism, there are still many gaps in the Framework that need to be clarified for it to deliver on the climate action we need, however.

The deal has been criticised by our countries – which abstained in the vote in April in protest – and climate experts, who have said it is too weak, too slow and riddled with loopholes.

Some critics have argued that the Framework risks becoming a “pay-to-pollute” system, allowing wealthy operators to carry on business as usual while we continue to bear the brunt of rising seas.

Oceania states have long been pushing for a flat emission fee on shipping, or a carbon levy, at the IMO, which would bring this sector much closer to the Paris Agreement as well as help drive the most cost-effective clean energy transition.

A first step

But if the scheme is flawed, the answer is not to undermine it, but to strengthen it – in the spirit of the ICJ ruling, which we will carry with us at the IMO. I believe the IMO Net-Zero Framework, if adopted, is just a first step.

The most important element is to guarantee shipping’s green transition is fair and equitable. This will require that the revenues collected from the carbon pricing, worth up to $15 billion a year in 2030, are allocated in a way that prioritises climate-vulnerable countries and those most affected by the impacts of climate change and can help us build climate-resilient transport and shipping systems we can depend on.

The Framework must also incentivise real, long-term clean energy solutions, like renewably produced e-fuels and wind technologies. Without these incentives, the IMO risks locking shipping into cheap and unsustainable alternatives like high-risk biofuels or climate-heating liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Rising seas and climate reality

International climate negotiations are often riddled with the challenge of bringing our stories and perspectives to a rigid world of suits, spreadsheets and square brackets. By participating in climate diplomacy events, I share the voices of my Temamfua – ancestors in the native Rotuman language – and share with them about my Ö’hön, which means both mother and Mother Earth, and how we keep mistreating our Ö’hön, yet she keeps loving us back.

Climate change is a lived reality for us, the people of Oceania.

When I followed the proclamation of the Hague court’s ruling in July, I thought of our family house in Malha’a, on my home island of Rotuma, Fiji, and the vast nearby beach that has steadily disappeared under the waves over the years. I thought of children in Kiribati studying the maps of islands they can no longer walk upon, and of the saltwater in our wells and reefs bleaching.

That is why the ICJ’s ruling was a moral victory that affirmed what we have always known and fought for: climate action is a binding legal obligation for all states. High-emitting countries have the responsibility to mitigate climate change and can no longer hide behind claims of sovereignty or economic difficulty.

When we meet in London again this month, I hope delegates remember that behind their debates and arguments on metrics and fuel standards stand real islands, real peoples and real futures. The ICJ has given us legal recognition. Whatever IMO member states decide, I will stand strong with fellow peoples of Oceania to remind states of their obligations under international law.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/John-Taukave-1440x959.png,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:34.669869

Industry voices are calling for clear global fuel standards and a robust greenhouse gas levy, arguing that these are essential to curb the vessel sector’s climate footprint.

The International Maritime Organization has drafted a Net-Zero Framework that combines mandatory emission limits with a GHG pricing mechanism. The plan targets ocean-going ships above 5 000 gross tonnage – which account for around 85% of shipping’s CO₂ output – and is expected to be formally adopted at the Summit, with enforcement beginning in 2027.

The proposals set a goal of net-zero emissions by roughly 2050, with interim targets including a 40% cut in carbon intensity by 2030 and 5-10 % use of zero- or near-zero-emission fuels by that year.

Voices within the industry are speaking out. Mark Bell, General Manager and COO of the SGMF (an NGO promoting gas as a marine fuel), told Seatrade Maritime News: “From what I’ve heard … it’s going to be a vote, yes or no, and it’s going to pass, so it’s going to open the playing fields as to what will happen. So, the floodgates will open.”

Meanwhile, Maersk has cautioned that a trading-credit scheme could unintentionally favour LNG over truly low-carbon alternatives. The firm argues that such a scheme might fail to penalise LNG usage sufficiently, undermining efforts to drive adoption of greener fuels.

Support also comes from across the shipping community: nearly 200 companies have voiced backing for the first global emissions fee under the IMO framework, despite political resistance from the US.

Opposition is not negligible. The US has formally rejected the Net-Zero Framework, warning that the measures would impose undue burdens on its shipping and consumer sectors – even threatening retaliatory action against states that support it.

Proponents of the framework, however, insist that global cooperation is vital. They stress the need for a level playing field and a just transition, especially to support developing nations adopting greener maritime technology.

At the Summit, key topics will include finalising global fuel standards, enforcing a greenhouse gas levy, and revising the Carbon Intensity Indicator to steer efficiency gains.

Analysts note that shipping is responsible for about 3% of global GHG emissions, placing it on a par with some major industrial nations. The Summit is widely viewed as a make-or-break moment: the industry must demonstrate credible climate ambition while balancing fairness and practical constraints.

In short, the IMO Green Summit is shaping up as a pivotal juncture – one in which the international shipping sector will either commit to aggressive decarbonisation or risk falling short of global climate expectations.",https://www.freightnews.co.za/files/styles/article_large/public/article/headline/2025-10/3-s.jpg?h=6e6be3ec&itok=D-xKTgWE,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:52.356131

President Nikos Christodoulides told the audience at the start of this week’s Cyprus Maritime Conference that assuming the European Presidency is both a responsibility and an opportunity that presents itself every 14 years.

He added that for his administration the Presidency is not just a priority, but also a national mission, with the need to boost European competitiveness and defence, through a deepening of the single market.

That means “Safeguarding the European Union's maritime transport competitiveness in the global market as an indispensable component of our efforts to strengthen the union's competitiveness and will be among the priorities of the Cyprus Presidency,” said Christodoulides.

Shipping Deputy Minister, Marina Hadjimanolis told Seatrade Maritime News that the framework for discussions that the Cypriot Presidency will lead includes the education and reskilling of seafarers, with a focus on bringing women into the workforce and an industrial strategy that puts digitalisation and decarbonisation at its core.

“It is a two-fold transition that will help drive the climate and the digital transition of waterborne transport while ensuring the continent's strategic autonomy and security,” explained Hadjimanolis.

Details of the strategy are being worked on now and prepared for a meeting of transport ministers in April next year which will see an agreement on how to move forward fleshed out and culminating in what Hadjimanolis said would be the Nicosia Declaration.

In support of the Cypriot Government’s announcement Apostolos Tzitzikostas EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, told the meeting that coming to Cyprus was like coming home.

He added: “It is a global maritime force and a hub at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa with a proud history of seafaring and a modern fleet that is among the largest in the European Union. Your flag is indeed a symbol of quality and trust.”

Shipping has shaped the EU trade, its economy and its security and it will continue to do so into the future. Shipping can be more resilient, competitive, sustainable and secure said the commissioner.

With EU tonnage declining to 33.6 million tonnes in 2024, from 38.5 million six year earlier Tzitzikostas said that the EU was responding with policies outlined in January this year, including the Competitiveness Compass, a “policy roadmap”, with three priorities: closing the innovation gap with the US and China, aligning decarbonisation with competitiveness and stepping up security and resilience.

“We follow this with a clean industrial deal which is turning Europe's sustainability goals into a competitive advantage for European industries and this has direct meaning for the maritime sector,” explained Tzitzikostas.

According to Tzitzikostas the current legislative framework allows vessel owners to plan fleet investments into retrofitting sustainable technologies.

Moreover, he said, “I will present next month a sustainable investment plan boosting the development of alternative fuels for transport. Because it's one thing to ask for sustainability and another if you cannot find the fuels to be sustainable.”

In what is the closest that any EU official has come to saying the EU will repeal its sustainable regulations once the IMO enforces its global regulations Tzitzikostas said: “Global measures agreed at the IMO aim to create a level playing field worldwide and this is much needed. A level playing field globally is the only, the only way [his emphasis] forward and Europe will continue to live with a mission supporting the IMO net zero framework.”

Solutions for the industry must be pragmatic said the commissioner, as well as efficient and economically viable.

Brussels will work with Cyprus to focus on “Safeguarding shipping, promoting fair trade, and strengthening global connectivity,” concluded Tzitzikostas.

So, while the energy transition could and should be faster, according to DNV, the ""electrification megatrend"" means that ""electricity isn’t just growing, it is becoming an unstoppable force"".
Will shipping be first industry to set global emissions limits and prices?
""Earlier this year, through the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the member states approved a landmark Net Zero Framework for global shipping.
With this big step, even with undefined areas and uncertainties, shipping is setting out to be the first industry to combine a worldwide limit to emissions and emissions pricing.","There is good news and bad news in shipping’s bid to decarbonise the roughly 3% of worldwide emissions the sector represents, according to DNV chief executive Remi Eriksen.

The Norwegian classification society chief started with the bad news in his outline of DNV’s findings from its latest annual report on the ongoing global transition away from polluting fossil fuels and towards lower-carbon energy systems.

""The bad news concerns the expensive end of decarbonisation, which is the hard-to-decarbonise sectors like shipping, aviation, heavy road transport and high heat manufacturing,"" Mr Eriksen said.

Specifically, the bad news is that these energy-intensive and difficult-to-green segments of the global economy are feeling the ’negative impact’ of geopolitical strife and a resultant economic slowdown, according to the DNV chief executive. In other words, DNV’s reading of future events in these sectors is drawn firmly from the world’s current troubles. DNV’s report sees the fragmentation of the global order, retrenchment toward self-interested, nationally focused energy security policies in some major economies and interlinked energy security narratives as a drag on the speed at which these sectors can decarbonise.

Based in part on these difficulties, DNV decided it needed to extend its Global Energy Transition Outlook forecast’s timeline by 10 years, from 2050 to 2060, ""because the transition is still very much in mid-stride in the 2050s. In fact, we find that net-zero emissions is only achieved a little after 2090. The accumulation of emissions until then takes us well beyond 2°C of global warming,"" as Mr Eriksen put it.

Compounding on the current geopolitical uncertainty to weigh on the energy transition’s progress in the short term is what Mr Eriksen called frustrations with ""unavailable and unreliable power grids"".

""So, what is stopping even faster near-term developments in electrification is lagging grid buildout,"" he said, noting that DNV’s estimation is grid infrastructure difficulties are slowing solar capacity uptake by 16% and wind projects by 8% through 2035.

Taken together, the slowed progress on decarbonisation and renewables equates to higher degrees of global warming by 2100.

""By the end of the century, science has shown beyond any doubt that humanity will then be experiencing, at great cost and discomfort, how critical each 10th of a degree of global warming is to our planet and society,"" Mr Eriksen said.

The good news

Despite the geopolitical and economic frustrations and infrastructure problems that are slowing the ongoing energy transitions away from fossil fuels, renewables are taking market share quickly, with China leading the way.

Overall, DNV’s figures show solar, both with and without storage, and onshore wind making up 32% of the global power mix by 2030. The report also foresees the troubles faced by offshore wind of late, particularly from the anti-wind stance by US President Donald Trump, being overcome by the turn of the decade, when offshore wind will be ""resurgent and starting to help grow the green mix"".

""By 2040, renewables will be 65% of all electricity and, 20 years later by 2060, electricity will be almost entirely non-fossil and will have moved from 21% of global energy demand today to 43% of global energy demand,"" Mr Eriksen said.

So, while the energy transition could and should be faster, according to DNV, the ""electrification megatrend"" means that ""electricity isn’t just growing, it is becoming an unstoppable force"".

Will shipping be first industry to set global emissions limits and prices?

In Mr Eriksen’s words, ""It looks very promising"".

""Earlier this year, through the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the member states approved a landmark Net Zero Framework for global shipping. With this big step, even with undefined areas and uncertainties, shipping is setting out to be the first industry to combine a worldwide limit to emissions and emissions pricing.

1.Green Methanol Production – producing renewable methanol from waste, targeting shipping and aviation fuel markets.

2.Hydrogen Power Systems – developing modular hydrogen-fueled ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) engines for off-grid power and pay-as-you-go (“PAYG”) deployment.

3.Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits – converting existing diesel locomotives to hydrogen-fueled systems.

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SRE Power, Inc., we also developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines. While that facility is currently offline due to disputes with counterparties and storm damage, it demonstrates our technical execution capability in building power plants under challenging conditions.

Corporate History

The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada in 1998 as Asia Properties, Inc. (“ASPZ”), focused initially on unrelated businesses. The company was re-domiciled in Wyoming in 2019. In August 2024, ASPZ completed a reverse merger with SRE Power, Inc., a renewable energy company with a history of geothermal project development and hydrogen combustion technologies. As part of the transaction, ASPZ was renamed HyOrc Corporation. Following the merger, former SRE shareholders became the controlling shareholders of HyOrc.

This merger provided HyOrc with:

●Operational experience in power plant construction.

●A platform to commercialize hydrogen and methanol technologies.

●A publicly traded vehicle to access capital markets.

Technology Platform

HyOrc’s core innovation is its External Combustion Technology (ECT) engine, which integrates with ORC turbines. Unlike conventional internal combustion engines or fuel cells, the ECT engine can run on multiple fuels while maintaining high efficiency and durability.

Key features include:

●Fuel Flexibility: Operates on hydrogen, LPG, natural gas, biogas, or syngas.

●Hydrogen Tolerance: Achieves >45% efficiency even with hydrogen purity as low as 97%, whereas PEM fuel cells typically require >99.9%.

●Durability: Stable efficiency over long operating hours, compared with efficiency degradation in PEM fuel cells.

●Cost Competitiveness: Comparable total cost of ownership to diesel engines, but with zero emissions when operating on hydrogen.

In addition to the ECT engine, HyOrc has developed intellectual property for waste-to-methanol production. This technology gasifies municipal solid waste and catalytically converts syngas into methanol. Methanol is an established global commodity chemical, increasingly adopted as a green fuel for shipping and aviation.

Principal Business Lines

1. Green Methanol Production

●Market Context: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated carbon reduction in global shipping. Green methanol is emerging as a favored solution, with major shipping lines such as Maersk and CMA CGM announcing large methanol-powered fleet orders. Aviation regulators are also exploring methanol-based synthetic fuels.

●HyOrc Projects: The Company is advancing development of methanol projects in Portugal and the United Kingdom, each based on proprietary waste-to-methanol technology. Discussions are underway with potential off-takers and partners.

●Competitive Advantage: HyOrc’s process leverages waste as a feedstock, reducing reliance on costly green hydrogen inputs and addressing municipal waste management challenges.

2. PAYG Hydrogen Power Systems

●Market Context: Critical infrastructure such as ports, hospitals, and data centers require zero-emission, reliable backup or off-grid power. Existing fuel cell solutions face challenges in cost, durability, and hydrogen purity requirements.

●HyOrc Solution: Modular PAYG hydrogen power units powered by our ECT engine. Customers purchase electricity on a pay-as-you-go model, minimizing upfront CAPEX.

●Pilot Projects: HyOrc is preparing pilot deployments in California (e.g., Port of Long Beach) and the EU.

●Competitive Advantage: Higher efficiency than fuel cells over time, lower total cost of ownership, and multi-fuel security.

3. Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits

●Market Context: Rail is a major contributor to transportation emissions. Europe alone has more than 15,000 diesel locomotives in need of decarbonization. India, with its massive rail network, is aggressively pursuing hydrogen pilots.

●HyOrc Solution: Retrofit kits replacing diesel engines with hydrogen-fueled ECT turbines.

●Progress to Date:

○Advanced proposals submitted to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) of Indian Railways for retrofitting the first of 1,500 diesel locomotives.

○Initiatives under discussion with EU partners for a fleet retrofit program.

●Competitive Advantage: Retrofit approach allows reuse of rolling stock at lower cost than purchasing new locomotives.

4. Geothermal Legacy Asset

●Through SRE, HyOrc developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines, completed in September 2023.

●The plant has remained offline since October 2024 due to a legal dispute with our counterparty. SRE Power retains economic rights and is pursuing legal remedies.

●Classified as Work-in-Progress on the balance sheet, with potential future recovery.

Intellectual Property

HyOrc’s IP portfolio includes:

●Patents filed/granted in India covering hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol processes, and locomotive retrofits.

●Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) extensions into the United States and European Union, currently under review.

●Trade secrets relating to catalytic conversion and system integration.

Competition

Our competitors fall into several categories:

●Fuel Cells (PEMFC, SOFC): Compete in hydrogen applications, but face challenges with purity requirements, high CAPEX, and limited lifespan.

●Battery-Electric Solutions: Effective in light vehicles and short-range applications but impractical for heavy trucks, locomotives, or long-haul shipping.

●Conventional ICEs: Diesel and natural gas engines remain entrenched but are rapidly facing regulatory phase out in multiple jurisdictions as they cannot economically run with very low or zero greenhouse emissions required to achieve net zero needed to stabilise and reverse climate change. HyOrc differentiates through efficiency, durability, fuel flexibility, and lower lifecycle cost.

Regulatory Environment

HyOrc operates in industries subject to evolving regulations:

●Shipping: IMO 2023 regulations require significant CO2 reductions.

●Aviation: ICAO CORSIA program driving demand for sustainable aviation fuels.

●Power Generation: Renewable portfolio standards and carbon pricing schemes in the EU and U.S. create tailwinds for hydrogen and methanol.

●Rail: India and EU have launched hydrogen locomotive initiatives.

Growth Strategy

HyOrc intends to:

●Secure long-term offtake agreements for green methanol.

●Deploy PAYG hydrogen pilots in ports and critical infrastructure.

●Close locomotive retrofit agreements in India and the EU.

●Raise capital via OTCQB uplist and eventual Nasdaq listing to fund commercialization.

●Expand patent portfolio globally.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10, before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Going Concern and Liquidity Risks

We have incurred recurring operating losses since inception, including a net loss of $1.63 million in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $8.2 million. Our auditors have included a going concern emphasis in their report. Unless we can secure additional financing in the near term, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

Dependence on Access to Capital

Our business strategy requires significant capital expenditures for R&D, manufacturing, and commercialization of our hydrogen engines and methanol projects. We estimate that we will need to raise at least $20 million over the next 24 months to achieve our objectives. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our projects, which would adversely affect our growth prospects.

Dilution of Shareholders

We expect to finance future operations primarily through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuances will dilute existing shareholders. Because we are currently an OTCID company with limited trading volume, new financings may be highly dilutive.

Early Stage of Commercialization

Our hydrogen engine technology and waste-to-methanol processes are in the pilot or development stage. Commercial adoption depends on successful scale-up, demonstration projects, and customer acceptance. If we are unable to prove reliability and cost-effectiveness at commercial scale, our business could fail to gain traction.

Technology and Development Risks

While we believe our technology offers advantages over fuel cells and batteries, it remains unproven at scale in commercial operations. Unexpected technical challenges could delay or prevent commercialization. Competing technologies may also advance more rapidly than anticipated, reducing our competitive advantage.

Reliance on Third-Party Manufacturing and Partners

We currently do not operate large-scale manufacturing facilities. Our business plan contemplates reliance on third-party manufacturers, such as Toyo Denki, Leroy Somer, Siemens, Kirloskar, RJ Italia, John Crane, Crompton, and Schneider for production of engines and components. If these manufacturers cannot deliver to our specifications or within agreed timelines, our operations will be adversely affected.

Counterparty Risks – Biliran Project

Through SRE Power, we constructed a 2MW geothermal plant in Biliran, Philippines. The plant is currently offline due to legal dispute for which we are pursuing legal remedies, but the outcome is uncertain. Our inability to recover value from this project could negatively impact our financial condition.

Customer Concentration and Project Risks

Our near-term opportunities involve large projects, such as locomotive retrofits with Indian Railways and methanol plants in Europe. If we fail to secure or execute these projects, our revenue generation could be delayed for years. In addition, delays, cost overruns, or cancellations could materially harm our financial position.

Market Adoption Risks

The success of our products depends on adoption by customers who have historically relied on diesel, natural gas, or grid power. Customers may be reluctant to adopt new technologies due to perceived risk, cost, or lack of familiarity. If adoption is slower than anticipated, our revenue and growth will be adversely affected.

Competitive Risks

We compete against established technologies including: (i) PEM fuel cells, supported by significant investment; (ii) battery-electric systems; and (iii) conventional diesel and gas engines. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and manufacturing resources than we do. If these competitors succeed in improving efficiency or lowering costs, our products may not achieve significant market share.

Regulatory and Policy Risks

Our operations are subject to complex and evolving regulations across multiple jurisdictions. For example, methanol projects depend on renewable fuel standards in the EU, while hydrogen deployment depends on government incentives and mandates in India and Europe. Changes in political priorities or reductions in incentives could materially impact demand for our products.

Intellectual Property Risks

Our competitive advantage depends on our patents and proprietary technology. While we have secured patents in India and filed PCT extensions in the U.S. and EU, there is no assurance that additional patents will be granted or that existing patents will not be challenged. Competitors may develop similar technology that circumvents our IP. Enforcement of IP rights is costly and uncertain, particularly in emerging markets.

Supply Chain Risks

Our technology depends on the availability of high-grade materials, catalysts, and components. Disruptions in global supply chains—such as shortages of metals, electronics, or catalysts—could increase costs or delay projects.

Geopolitical Risks

Our projects span multiple jurisdictions including the Philippines, India, the EU, and the United States. Political instability, changes in trade policies, or currency fluctuations in these regions could negatively affect operations.

Management and Key Personnel Risks

We are highly dependent on a small group of executives and technical leaders. The loss of any key personnel, particularly our CEO or CTO, could harm our ability to execute our strategy. We currently have limited bench strength and may struggle to recruit qualified personnel.

Risks of Operating as a Public Company

As a public company, we are subject to SEC reporting requirements and associated costs. We are in the process of uplisting from OTCID to OTCQB and eventually Nasdaq. Failure to successfully uplist could limit liquidity, reduce investor interest, and impair our ability to raise capital.

Share Price Volatility

Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price volatility and low trading volume. The market price of our stock may be influenced by announcements regarding project milestones, financing events, or litigation. Such volatility may discourage institutional investors from participating.

Litigation and Legal Risks

We are engaged in disputes concerning the Biliran project. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain. Adverse rulings could materially affect our financial position.

Cybersecurity and IT Risks

Our operations and intellectual property are dependent on digital systems. A cyberattack or data breach could result in the theft of proprietary technology or disruption of our operations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2024, and the related notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10.

Overview

HyOrc Corporation is in the development and early commercialization phase of its clean-energy technology business. Our 2024 financial results reflect the first year of revenue recognition, primarily from technical services provided through our subsidiary SRE Power. The Company also incurred significant expenses related to research and development, legal proceedings, and the reverse merger transaction with SRE.

Expansion of our business is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term as we build infrastructure, develop pilot projects, and pursue commercialization of our hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol technology, and locomotive retrofit systems.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2024, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023

●Revenues: In 2024, we generated revenues of approximately $617,000, primarily from technical service contracts related to SRE Power’s geothermal power station project. In contrast, we recorded no revenues in 2023. The initiation of revenues reflects early commercialization of SRE’s engineering expertise, though not yet related to hydrogen or methanol products.

●Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased significantly to approximately $2.2 million in 2024 from $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects higher R&D and equipment expenditures, legal and professional fees associated with litigation and the merger and expanded corporate governance costs.

●Net Loss: Net loss for 2024 was approximately $1.63 million, compared to a net loss of $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects the scaling of operations, investment in technology, and legal/professional expenses.

●Balance Sheet Highlights: Total assets increased to approximately $22.2 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to recognition of intangible assets and goodwill from the reverse merger, as well as classification of the Biliran plant contract asset as a non-current asset. Liabilities remained modest, reflecting limited use of debt financing.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had limited cash resources and remain dependent on external financing to fund operations. Subsequent to year-end, we raised approximately $110,000 through the issuance of common stock to investors. These proceeds provide near-term working capital but are not sufficient for commercialization.

We estimate that we will require at least $20 million in additional capital over the next 24 months to:

●Develop and construct our first commercial waste-to-methanol facilities in Portugal and the UK.

●Deploy pilot PAYG hydrogen units in California and Europe.

●Advance locomotive retrofit programs with Indian Railways and EU partners.

Sources of capital may include equity issuances, convertible debt, strategic joint ventures, engineering services and project financing. If we are unable to secure financing, we may delay or scale back projects.

Cash Flows

●Operating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $550,000 in 2024, compared to minimal usage in 2023. The increase reflects higher expenditures related to R&D, litigation, and professional services.

●Investing Activities: Minimal, other than expenditures related to technology development and project preparation.

●Financing Activities: Provided cash inflows through equity issuances, including share sales to Richard Oblath and Carl Mueller in early 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Key policies include:

1.Revenue Recognition (ASC 606) – We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied, which in 2024 primarily related to technical service contracts.

2.Business Combinations (ASC 805) – The reverse merger with SRE required purchase price allocation and recognition of goodwill and intangible assets.

3.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360) – We evaluate plant, equipment, and intangible assets for impairment if events indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Biliran project is classified as Work-in-Progress but not impaired at this time.

4.Going Concern (ASC 205-40) – Given recurring losses and limited capital, management has evaluated going concern considerations and disclosed the need for additional financing.

Going Concern Considerations

Our financial statements include an emphasis of matter regarding doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. While management believes we can raise sufficient funds and secure contracts to support operations, there is no assurance of success.

Outlook

Looking ahead, we are focused on:

●Advancing green methanol projects in Portugal and the UK toward FEED studies and offtake agreements.

●Deploying PAYG hydrogen power pilots in California and Europe.

●Securing agreements with Banaras Locomotive Works in India for locomotive retrofits.

●Defending our position in the Biliran dispute to protect shareholder value.

●Uplisting to OTCQB and pursuing Nasdaq listing to access broader capital markets.

Management believes these initiatives, if successfully executed, will position the Company for significant revenue generation beginning in 2026.

Matters related to Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements if it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The company has suffered losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Explanatory Paragraph - Other Non-Current Assets and Related Impairment

We draw attention to Note 1 and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements regarding recognition of Other Non Current Assets towards the lien by the company over the Geothermal facility establishing the right over those assets and the subsequent impairment on account of the facility being non operational due to persistent grid instability and the physical damage caused by the typhoon and dispute with BGI and realisability of the claim from the insurance company and the consequential management estimate towards recognition of impairment of

$300,000.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor we have engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company was initially organized in the name of Asia Properties, Inc. on April 6, 1998, as a Wyoming Corporation, seeking opportunities to invest in real estate. On April 3, 2019. the Company moved its jurisdiction from the State of Nevada to the State of Wyoming. The Company’s common stock is trading in the OTC Market under the symbol “ASPZ”.

From 2022, the Company has been exploring different potential gold mining opportunities and is focused on gold mines with NI 43-101 or JORC geological reports with indicated or measured reserves.

On June 27, 2024, the Company acquired a Texas hydrogen technology company, SRE Power, Inc (“SRE”) for 655,374,256 newly issued ASPZ common stock. SRE is now 100% owned by ASPZ. ASPZ is now conducting the business of developing the HyOrc hydrogen engine technology and the other technologies owned by SRE. ASPZ filed for a name change with Wyoming in September 2024 and is currently doing business as HyOrc Corporation. (“HyOrc” / “we”/ “our”/ “us”) (Refer to Principles of Consolidation below).

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.GAAP”) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.

Reverse Acquisition and Principles of Consolidation

As described above, on June 27, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a reorganization and stock purchase agreement (“agreement”) with SRE and the 100% shareholders of SRE whereby the SRE shareholders desired to sell and the Company agreed to purchase SRE shares thereby making SRE, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued 655,374,256 shares as the purchase consideration to the SRE shareholders. Following the closing of the agreement, SRE shareholders collectively owned around 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis.

Further, at the closing, the then Board member of the Company. Debra Childers had tendered her resignation as the director and the officer of the Company and the then Board considered and deemed it advisable to the best interest of the Company to fill the vacancy in the Board by appointing Reginald Fubara, Shinichi Hirano and James McNaught-Davis as the members of the Company’s Board of Directors effective as of the closing.

We determine SRE an accounting acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the reverse acquisition, former shareholders of SRE held a majority of the voting interest of the combined company; (ii) former Board of Directors of SRE possess majority control of the Board of Directors of the combined company; (iii) Reginald, being the member of the management of SRE is responsible for the management of the combined company. As such, we have treated the financial statements of SRE as the historical financial statements of the combined company (“consolidated financial statements” / “financial statements”).

We have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions. (Refer to Note 3).

Consequent to the reverse acquisition, the financial statements of the newly combined entity represent a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer/legal acquiree. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquirer are presented at their historical carrying values in the consolidated financial statements of the newly combined entity and the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquiree/legal acquirer are recognized on the acquisition date and measured by using the acquisition method. The results of the accounting acquiree’s/legal acquirer’s results of operations are included in the combined company’s financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

The accompanying financial statements prepared following the reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the accounting acquiree, HyOrc but described as a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer, SRE, with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the accounting acquiree. Comparative information presented in these consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

The accompanying financial statements represent all of the following:

a. The assets and liabilities of SRE recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.

b. The assets and liabilities of HyOrc recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations.

c. The retained earnings and other equity balances of the SRE before the business combination.

d. The amount recognized as issued equity interests in the financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of SRE outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value HyOrc determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc, including the equity interests which HyOrc issued to the SRE shareholders to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of SRE is restated using the exchange ratio established in the Agreement to reflect the number of shares of HyOrc issued in the reverse acquisition.

For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received in the acquisition.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered and certain amounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. These estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by the Company include, but are not limited to:

●provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances and tax uncertainties

●business combinations and purchase price allocations

●recoverability of long-lived assets and contract assets and their related estimated lives

●evaluation of goodwill for impairment

●accruals for estimated liabilities

●net-realizable value of inventory and credit loss on accounts receivable and contract assets.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. There was no difference between net loss and comprehensive loss presented in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who, together with the Board of Directors, is accountable for overall strategy, resource allocation, and operational oversight. The CODM evaluates financial performance and makes key decisions based on consolidated financial information. There are no individual segment managers who are held accountable for discrete business activities, and the Company does not manage operations or allocate resources based on distinct business lines or geographic components. Accordingly, the Company operates as a single reportable and operating segment for the purposes of financial reporting under ASC 280 - Segment Reporting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, certificates of deposits and money market funds that are readily convertible into cash, all with original maturity dates of three months or less.

Concentration of Credit Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions.

Customer Concentration Risk

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the entire sales pertained to only one customer. The Company’s reliance on this major customer presents a concentration risk. Loss of this customer or a significant reduction in their order could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance. The Company continues to focus on efforts to diversify its customer base to mitigate such risks. There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Related Parties

Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. All transactions are recorded at arm’s length prices, reflecting the fair value of the goods or services exchanged.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assesses its income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. In accordance with ASC 740-10, for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, our policy will be to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is presented down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs.

Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable pricing inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are the dues from customers and are shown net of applicable reserves for doubtful accounts as shown on the face of the balance sheet. There were no accounts that had been placed on non-accrual status. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been estimated by management based on historical experience, current market trends and, for larger customer accounts, their assessment of the ability of the customers to pay outstanding balances. Past due balances and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Changes in circumstances relating to the collectability of accounts receivable may result in the need to increase or decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts in the future.

The allowance for bad debt recognized was $512,815 and $0 within general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net (“PP&E”) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives.

PP&E consists of unproved properties and, thus, the costs associated with such properties are not subject to depletion. The Company historically has acquired unproved properties by purchasing individual or small groups of leases directly from mineral owners which leases historically have not been subject to specified drilling projects. Capitalized costs associated with unproved properties, which includes leases that have expired or have been deemed uneconomic, are fully impaired.

Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Replacements, maintenance, and repairs, which do not significantly improve or extend the useful life of the assets, are expensed when incurred.

Upon the sale or retirement of assets, costs and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by determining whether there were any triggering events that could impact the Company’s assets. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable the Company performs a comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 upon inception.

To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract was determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assessed the goods or services promised within each contract and determined those that were performance obligations, and assessed whether each promised good or service was distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606.

PFBT Agreement with BGI

SRE and Biliran Geothermal, Inc. (BGI) entered into a 25-year Project Funding, Build and Transfer Agreement (PFBT Agreement) in June 2021 for a 50 MW geothermal facility at Sitio Pulang Yuta, Brgy. Cabibihan, Caibiran, Biliran Province, Philippines. Under this arrangement:

●SRE finances, designs, constructs, installs and commissions the geothermal power plant in phases, beginning with a 2 MW module commissioned in September 2023. ●SRE also finances and upgrades the existing 13.2 kV distribution lines of Biliran Electric Cooperative (Bileco) to evacuate energy to the national grid. ●Upon final acceptance, SRE Power provides operation and maintenance (O&M) and technical support services over the 25-year term. ●Revenue comprises fixed construction and commissioning fees, reimbursements for agreed costs, and a variable share of electricity generation proceeds, all invoiced monthly per the contractual formula.

The Company identified the PFBT Agreement constitutes a single, enforceable contract. The distinct performance obligations under the Agreement are as follows:

●Design, construction, installation and commissioning of plant modules ●O&M and technical support services during operations ●Revenue share from daily electricity generation

Transaction price for the agreement consists of fixed fees for construction and commissioning, variable consideration based on BGI’s monthly electricity sales share and reimbursements of agreed costs. Estimates of variable consideration are included only to the extent that significant reversals are not probable.

Construction & Commissioning: Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the module passes commissioning tests and BGI has practical acceptance evidence.

O&M & Technical Support: Revenue is recognized over time using an input method (e.g., labor hours, machine- hours) as support services are rendered.

Electricity-Generation Share: Recognize over time on an output basis tied to daily meter readings of power delivered.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the revenue recognized of $617,115 comprised only of the O&M & technical services provided to BGI.

Other Non-Current Assets

Other non-current assets represent capitalized costs incurred for the construction of geothermal plant, which is in progress, that is constructed and commissioned by SRE under the PFBT Agreement (Refer to Revenue Recognition).

BGI will own all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities, and designs that are supplied, installed, or utilized for the Geothermal Facility. However, BGI agrees to create a Lien over these assets in favor of SRE. This Lien serves as security to ensure repayment for the work that SRE performs on the Geothermal Facility. The Lien will not extend to Bileco Lines because The Bileco Lines are owned by Bileco, not BGI. The parties acknowledge this distinction, ensuring BGI does not impose financial claims over infrastructure it does not control. This provision protects SRE’s financial interests while clarifying ownership limitations regarding the distribution lines. Accordingly, the said asset is recognized and presented under Other non-current assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Considering the persistent grid instability in April 2024 of the equipment which resulted in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment and the legal dispute with BGI as described in Note 2 below, the management assessed that the qualitative indicators for impairment existed and hence a qualitative assessment was performed. Based on the management’s judgement, the Company has recognized an impairment loss to the extent of around $300,000 in the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the same was reduced from the carrying value of the non-current assets and the net carrying value of other non-current assets amount to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Accounts payable represents dues to vendors against whom operating expenses are incurred.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the excess cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In accordance with Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment or on an interim basis when indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the reporting structure.

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each of the applicable reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, discount rates, competitive environments and financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required.

The Company also has the option to proceed directly to the quantitative test. Under the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized, up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Management can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period for any reporting unit.

For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

Net earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares subject to redemption or forfeiture. The Company presents basic and diluted net earnings or loss per share. Diluted net earnings or loss per share reflect the actual weighted average of common shares issued and outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities outstanding. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share if their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

The financial statements of the combined entity reflect the equity of the HyOrc including the equity interests issued as part of the reverse acquisition. As a result, EPS is calculated on the basis of the capital structure of HyOrc. In line with ASC 805-40-45-2(d), the following is considered:

In calculating the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings-per- share [EPS] calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs:

a. The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of the period to the acquisition date is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of SRE outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

b. The number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of the period is the actual number of common shares of the HyOrc outstanding during that period.

The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the financial statements following a reverse acquisition is calculated by dividing (a) by (b):

a. The income of the SRE attributable to common shareholders in each of those periods.

b. SRE’s weighted-average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

The issued and outstanding common shares of SRE through the acquisition date was 1,000,000 and the exchange ratio established in the agreement was 655.36, thereby resulting in the pro-rated weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the purposes of computing EPS to be 382,301,649. Weighted average common shares of Hyorc outstanding from acquisition through December 31, 2024 was 303,414,008. This resulted in the weighted-average total number of common shares for computing EPS to be 685,715,657 for the year ended December 31,2024.

The weighted-average number of common shares multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement resulted in 655,374,256 common shares for 2023.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of patents owned by SRE which have been granted by the Indian government due to work done at the Indian R&D centre. HyOrc is expanding patent coverage with the application process primarily in the USA, EU, Japan through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements. These patents were acquired through an assignment agreement entered by SRE in May 2024 through which SRE acquired ownership interests in the patents including utility models and design patents and registrations and applications assigned by the Assignor.

The consideration terms were agreed in such a way that the Assignor is entitled to 5% of all the shares received by SRE upon SRE achieving a reverse takeover of a publicly traded company whose shares are traded on the OTC markets or similar stock exchanges.

Accordingly, the Company issued 32,768,712 common shares of SRE as the consideration for the acquisition of the patents which represented 5% of the shares acquired by the owners of SRE through the reverse acquisition with the Company at a value of $0.11 per common share. (Refer to Note 3) resulting in a total consideration of

$3,604,588.

The patents have an indefinite useful life because it is expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and the associated costs of renewal are not significant. The patents are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350-30-35-18. For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the patents were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

In connection with the reverse acquisition, the Company identified intangible assets, which are solely customer relationships (refer to Note 3). For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of these intangible assets, of which there were indications that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these intangible assets units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed and the intangible assets were fully impaired with a corresponding impairment loss recognized in the Statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including other non-current assets) may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new relevant accounting pronouncements that are in effect through the date of these financial statements. The pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed., and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.

ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requires disaggregation of specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements and a qualitative description of the remaining expense amounts not separately disaggregated. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures and we intend to adopt this as and when applicable.

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN

The Company has a net loss of $1,632,163 for the year ended December 31, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of $8,216,241 as of December 31, 2024.

SRE is the operator of the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran Philippines and is entitled to 60% of the operating profits from the project for the lifetime of the project which is expected to be 25 years.

Biliran Geothermal Project (2MW) – Operational Status as of December 31, 2024

As of December 31, 2024, the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran remained offline and non-operational due to infrastructure damage. The project began experiencing persistent grid instability in April 2024, resulting in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment. On October 05, 2024, the plant was taken offline following a technical inspection that revealed accumulated damage to key systems, making continued operation unsafe. Shortly after this shutdown, Typhoon Kristine-Trami struck the region and caused additional physical damage to the facility. Despite the existence of an insurance policy intended to cover such events, we have not received confirmation that a claim has been activated, and we have not received cooperation from the project counterparties responsible for managing the insurance process.

The company continues to engage stakeholders and explore legal and commercial remedies to protect our position, recover losses, and restore the project’s operational viability.

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the financial statements are available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results.

Management Plans

Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenues and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs.

While uncertainties remain with respect to the timing of insurance recovery and revenue realization, management is reasonably certain in the Company’s ability to meet its operational and financial obligations over the next twelve months through a combination of funding, asset deployment, and resolution of existing claims but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so.

These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due. If it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

Since the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has successfully raised post-balance sheet capital through share issuances and continues to actively pursue funding opportunities to support operations and growth. In parallel, the Company has made strategic progress in hydrogen engine development, secured new business opportunities in the UK, EU, and India, and commenced ISO certification to facilitate future deployments in regulated sectors such as rail and energy. (Refer to Note 8 for subsequent events)

The Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

NOTE 3. REVERSE ACQUISITION

The Company evaluated the acquisition of SRE pursuant to ASC 805 and ASU 2017-01, Topic 805, Business Combinations. As described in Note 1, we have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions.

Accordingly, the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred by SRE was based on the number of equity interests SRE would have had to issue to give the owners of HyOrc the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.

The acquisition method of accounting requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be measured at their estimated respective fair values as of the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction represents primarily the potential economic benefits that the Company believes may arise from the acquisition. In the reverse acquisition described above, HyOrc’s assets and liabilities were measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 on Business Combinations and Goodwill is measured as the excess of fair value of consideration effectively transferred by SRE, the accounting acquirer over the fair value of the net assets of HyOrc, the accounting acquiree on the acquisition date.

The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of HyOrc:

Total Customer relationship - Intangibles $932,088 Goodwill 15,755,344 Purchase price consideration effectively transferred $16,687,432

The fair value consideration effectively transferred was determined based on the number of common stock which SRE would have had to issue to the owners of HyOrc at the fair value per share of SRE on the date of acquisition to provide the same ratio of ownership (90%) in the combined entity as a result of the reverse acquisition.

Pursuant to the reverse acquisition, the Company engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value per share of SRE which as determined using the fair value of net assets as on the acquisition date. Given the limited operations of HyOrc in the period preceding the acquisition, the fair value per common share of SRE was considered to be more reliable and reflects the economic substance of the consideration effectively transferred.

The fair value of net assets of SRE as on the acquisition date is as follows:

Total Property, plant and equipment, net $- Other intangible assets 150,000,000 Cash and cash equivalents 347,058 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (160,169) Fair value of net assets $

150,186,889

Number of SRE shares outstanding on the acquisition date 1,000,000 Fair Value per share on the acquisition date $150.19

SRE’s balance sheet includes a geothermal plant, which is classified as Other non-current assets. The fair value of this asset was determined to be $15,000,000 by an independent third-party valuation at the time of acquisition. However, management has concluded that this fair value should not be factored into the overall business valuation of SRE. This decision is based on the fact that the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to the company’s business operations. Furthermore, the terms of the agreement with BGI, along with the rights BGI exercises over the asset, limit SRE’s control and ability to derive economic significant benefits from the plant. This rationale aligns with the principles of U.S. GAAP, where the value of an asset in a business valuation is tied to its operational contribution and the economic benefits it provides, not merely its standalone fair value.

SRE would have had to issue 111,111 shares to the owners of HyOrc to maintain the 90% ownership in the combined entity which effectively would have made the total common stock issued and outstanding of SRE to be 1,111,111 as of December 31, 2024.

HyOrc had 72,819,362 common shares issued and outstanding of par value $0.001 each prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition. Further, SRE shareholders received 655,374,256 common shares of HyOrc as the consideration for the share exchange.

Accordingly, the equity structure in the financial statements reflect the sum of SRE’s issued equity immediately before the reverse acquisition, and the fair value of the hypothetical consideration effectively transferred. The equity structure (i.e., the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc. However, the balance is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding shares of HyOrc, including the number of shares issued in the reverse acquisition and the difference is recognized as an adjustment to the Additional paid-in capital. For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of the SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received by SRE in the acquisition.

Goodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition and other intangible assets that qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The results of HyOrc have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

NOTE 4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Plant and Equipment – unproved properties 60,000 60,000 Property, plant and equipment, gross 60,000 60,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (60,000) (60,000) Property, plant and equipment, net $- $-

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 amounted to $0 and $0, respectively.

The unproved property interests comprise the consideration paid in March 2017 for Symba America Oil & Gas’s working interest in an oil well near Ganado, Texas. Having since ceased oil extraction activities, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35. That assessment indicated that the fair value of these unproved properties was negligible or nominal; accordingly, the entire carrying amount has been written down to $0.

NOTE 5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Customer relationships – reverse acquisition $932,088 $- Patents 3,604,558 - 4,536,646 - Accumulated impairment loss (932,088) Accumulated amortization - - Intangible assets, net $3,604,558 $0

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. The Company, in conjunction with its legal counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for litigation or loss contingencies. A liability is recorded when and if it is determined that such a liability for litigation or loss contingencies is both probable and estimable.

Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position except as described in Note 2.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate primarily to net operating loss carry forwards. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record a current or deferred income tax expense or benefit due to current and historical losses incurred by the Company.

The Company has evaluated its income tax positions and has determined that it does not have any uncertain tax positions. The Company will recognize interest and penalties related to any uncertain tax positions through its income tax expense.

The Company is not presently subject to any income tax audit in any taxing jurisdiction, though its 2022-2023 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.

NOTE 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In the first quarter of 2025, the Company issued 11,000,000 common shares and raised around $110,000 through private share placements to individual investors. The Company has also commenced formal procedures for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification to support manufacturing and environmental compliance for upcoming contracts.

The Company has submitted technical proposals to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) under Indian Railways for hydrogen retrofit deployment and has advanced few methanol project initiatives in Portugal and UK, and hydrogen retrofitting engagements with local operators and OEM partners. No other events have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and through the date of these financial statements that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial information referred to above. Management has evaluated subsequent events through July 31, 2025, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

We are providing this letter in connection with your audit of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of HyOrc Corporation. (referred as “Consolidated Financial Statements”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of HyOrc Corporation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We confirm that we are responsible for the fair presentation in the consolidated financial statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material. Items are considered material, regardless of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by the omission or misstatement. We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, as of July 29, 2025, the following representations made to you during your audit(s).

1. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2. We have made available to you all—

(a) Financial records and related data, including the names of all related parties and all relationships and transactions with related parties.

(b) Minutes of the meetings of stockholders, directors, and committees of directors, or summaries of actions of recent meetings for which minutes have not yet been prepared.

3. There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning noncompliance with or deficiencies in financial reporting practices.

4. There are no material transactions that have not been properly recorded in the accounting records underlying the consolidated financial statements.

5. We believe that the effects of the uncorrected financial statement misstatements summarized in the accompanying schedule are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

6. We acknowledge our responsibility for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud.

7. We have no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity involving—

(a) Management,

(b) Employees who have significant roles in internal control, or

(c) Others where the fraud could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

8. We have no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity received in communications from employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others.

9. The company has no plans or intentions that may materially affect the carrying value or classification of assets and liabilities.

10. The following have been properly recorded or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements wherever applicable:

(a) There are no Related-party transactions involved, including sales, purchases, loans, transfers, leasing arrangements, and guarantees, and amounts receivable from or payable to related parties.

(b) Guarantees, whether written or oral, under which the company is contingently liable.

(c) Significant estimates and material concentrations known to management that are required to be disclosed.

Significant estimates are estimates at the balance sheet date that could change materially within the next year. Concentrations refer to volumes of business, revenues, available sources of supply, or markets or geographic areas for which events could occur that would significantly disrupt normal finances within the next year.

11. There are no—

(a) Violations or possible violations of laws or regulations whose effects should be considered for disclosure in the consolidated financial statements or as a basis for recording a loss contingency.

(b) Unasserted claims or assessments that our lawyer has advised us are probable of assertion and must be disclosed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.

(c) Other liabilities or gain or loss contingencies that are required to be accrued or disclosed by FASB Statement No. 5.

(d) Side agreements or other arrangements (either written or oral) that have not been disclosed to you.

12. The company has satisfactory title to all owned assets, and there are no liens or encumbrances on such assets, nor has any asset been pledged as collateral except as disclosed.

13. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we make the following representations regarding Other Non-Current Assets and related impairment, as disclosed in Note 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024:

☐ The balance of Other Non-Current Assets represents capitalized costs incurred for the construction of the geothermal facility under the Power Facility Build-Transfer Agreement between BGI and SRE.

☐ Under that Agreement, BGI retains title to all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities and proprietary designs, and has granted SRE a lien on those assets (excluding the Bileco distribution lines, which are owned by Bileco) as security for payment of SRE’s construction and commissioning services.

☐ During April 2024, persistent grid instability resulted in over 250 grid trips that progressively stressed and wore critical equipment and gave rise to a legal dispute with BGI (see Note 2).

☐ Management concluded that these events constituted qualitative indicators of impairment and, accordingly, recorded an impairment loss of $300,000 in the year ended December 31, 2024.

☐ As a result of that impairment, the net carrying value of Other Non-Current Assets was reduced to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

☐ All material facts and circumstances related to the lien arrangement, grid-trip events, legal dispute and impairment decision have been disclosed to you and are reflected appropriately in the consolidated financial statements.

14. The company has complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in the event of non-compliance.

15. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we confirm that the geothermal plant recorded under Other Non-Current Assets at a fair value of $15,000,000 determined by an independent third-party valuation as of the acquisition date has not been included in SRE’s overall business valuation. Management’s conclusion rests on two primary factors: first, the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to SRE’s operating cash flows; second, the Build-Transfer Agreement with BGI grants BGI title and certain control rights (including a lien on plant assets and the right to direct commissioning timing), which materially restrict SRE’s ability to direct the use of the asset and to derive its economic benefits. This treatment is consistent with U.S. GAAP, under which asset values incorporated in a business valuation must reflect an asset’s operational contribution and its capacity to generate future economic benefits, rather than its standalone fair value. We did not include this fair value of the noncurrent asset in the computation of goodwill.

16. We agree with the findings of specialists in evaluating Existence and valuation of the Intellectual Property Portfolio and have adequately considered the qualifications of the specialist in determining the amounts and disclosures used in the consolidated financial statements and underlying accounting records.

We did not give or cause any instructions to be given to specialists with respect to the values or amounts derived in an attempt to bias their work, and we are not otherwise aware of any matters that have had an impact on the independence or objectivity of the specialists.

17. We represent that the inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value and valuation allowances are made accurately for the inventories whose net realizable value is lower than the cost. Net realizable value is estimated by the management experience and expertise.

18. We further represent that the net realizable value of the inventories has been considered based on the estimated selling prices after deducting the estimated selling expenses of those inventories in the ordinarycourse of business. These are estimated considering the present condition of the inventory along with the contracts entered into by the company.

19. We are currently maintaining inventory records in Excel sheets as part of our early-stage accounting system. However, we have initiated a migration to QuickBooks, which will enable more automated and structured inventory tracking ",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-10-08 07:56:07.774345

Singling out an issue on which he felt Interferry’s intervention, coupled with broader industry concern, had found success, Mr Roos pointed to International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII).
Mr Roos said, “We have been very vocally against it.
“It’s going to be tough – doable but tough,” Mr Roos commented.
That is why at Interferry we have raised a very big stop sign.","The financial implications of environmental regulations were among the most topical issues discussed on the first day of global ferry trade group Interferry’s annual conference, taking place in Sorrento, Italy.

Interferry director of regulatory affairs Johan Roos gave an update which highlighted what he called major issues that the association has been campaigning on. Singling out an issue on which he felt Interferry’s intervention, coupled with broader industry concern, had found success, Mr Roos pointed to International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII). Action on what the industry saw as shortfalls in the policy led to the postponement of the regulation from 2026 to at least 2030.

Mr Roos said, “We have been very vocally against it. Luckily, we made a big contribution to putting it on the backburner and we don’t expect it to come back until 2030 at the earliest and when it does, I don’t expect it to be very negative, so that is good.”

He also homed in on IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), which measures the carbon content in energy used, and money is paid per tonne of CO2 used to incentivise operators and generate revenue.

“It’s going to be tough – doable but tough,” Mr Roos commented.

The major potential complication with NZF, in the eyes of Interferry and the ferry industry, according to Mr Roos, is that it is one of two parallel instruments attempting to do the same thing, leading to the possibility of double taxation. These parallel instruments are IMO’s rules on fuel intensity and greenhouse gas emissions and the EU’s policies on emissions and fuels, the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Mr Roos said Interferry is campaigning for the EU to harmonise its GHG regulations with those of the IMO to avoid the potential for the sector and the wider shipping industry to incur double taxation as well as other financial and operational challenges.

Mr Roos told delegates, “If we retain EU schemes and add the IMO [schemes] it will double the energy cost in 2028 and in 2035, it will double again compared to 2038, meaning it will be four times what we pay today. That is why at Interferry we have raised a very big stop sign. We are happy to pay into a system to incentivise the lowering of carbon content, but we will not pay twice.”

Should there be an affirmative vote for IMO’s measures at the next extraordinary meeting of the IMO’s Maritime Environment Protection Committee meeting in October 2025, Mr Roos said Interferry will prepare a “very strong” statement.

“We will be knocking on doors in Brussels, reminding them of their obligation: Europe always said it is putting in place regulation as a place holder for global regulations, and then when these come in, it will back off,” warned Mr Roos.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/122/ROOS_Interferry_Main.JPG,N,,2025-10-08 07:56:17.264411

Lines, Ltd. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NH3 Clean Energy Limited (NH3) and Oceania Marine Energy (Oceania) regarding the development of clean ammonia bunkering operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. This is a memorandum of understanding to promote collaboration with NH3 and Oceania on the Pilbara Clean Fuels Bunkering Hub initiative, which is Australia’s first ammonia bunkering concept announced by the Pilbara Ports Authority in June this year. MOL will be the world’s first ocean-going shipping company to participate in this initiative.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to the world’s largest iron ore export port and serves as a major port of call for Capesize bulkers. The Pilbara Ports Authority has entered into a joint development agreement with NH3, which will supply blue ammonia, and Oceania, which will operate the bunkering business, to realize low-carbon ammonia bunkering in the region. Their goal is to commence bunkering operations for Capesize bulkers at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland by 2030.

This MoU aims for MOL, NH3, and Oceania to collaborate on the transition of iron ore carriers in the Pilbara region to ammonia fuel and the realization of the WAH2 project(Note 2). Together, we will jointly propose solutions to Western Australian iron ore suppliers and work to address issues such as safety in ammonia bunkering operations.

MOL will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH NV, which are scheduled to be delivered by China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between 2026 and 2027. These vessels will be chartered by MOL(Note 3). MOL is looking to establish a fleet of ammonia duel-fuelled capesize bulk carriers on the West Australia to East Asia trade route and ensure safe ammonia bunkering operations and consider the procurement of ammonia. As an operator of ammonia dual-fuel vessels, MOL will work for this project to advance considerations regarding safety assurance and ammonia procurement in the Pilbara region.

MOL’s Managing Executive Officer Kazuhiro Takahashi commented:

We are honored to sign this MoU with NH3 and Oceania today, which will be a vital hub for our ammonia dual-fueled capesize bulkers scheduled to commence operations from 2026. This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region. By working closely with our partners, we look forward to building a robust framework for safe ammonia bunkering and advancing sustainable shipping together.

NH3’s Chairman Charles Whitfield commented:

We are delighted to have this agreement with MOL that helps to take the clean ammonia bunkering business another step closer to reality. This new agreement reinforces the growing momentum behind the shift to low-emission maritime fuels and builds on the existing Joint Development Agreement between NH3, Pilbara Ports, and Oceania Marine to establish an ammonia hub in the Pilbara by 2030. We sincerely appreciate Premier Cook and his team’s continued support in helping to establish this emerging clean energy industry – paving the way for a more sustainable future for our mining sector and energy exports.

Oceania’s Managing Director Nick Bentley commented:

Oceania’s collaboration with MOL and NH3 Clean Energy shows how partnerships across the energy and shipping sectors can deliver real emission reduction outcomes for Australia’s iron ore exporters and shipping industry. By combining NH3’s clean ammonia production capacity, Pilbara Ports’ infrastructure, Oceania’s bunker services and MOL’s pioneering dual-fuel fleet, we are creating an integrated end-to-end marine fuel solution that enables our customers to meet the IMO’s decarbonisation targets.

World Maritime Day Parallel Event focuses on advancing innovation and growth while protecting the ocean.

Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, was the stage to exchange ideas, showcase innovation and strengthen international cooperation during the celebration of the 2025 World Maritime Day Parallel Event last week.

The event (30 September – 1 October) was hosted by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Welcoming delegates, the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, H.E Suhail bin Mohamed Al Mazrouei, said: “This gathering gives us an opportunity to unite our efforts toward achieving that balance of economic growth with protecting the oceans which connect us together and keeping them healthy for the next generation.”

IMO Secretary-General Mr. Arsenio Dominguez said: “By facing environmental challenges, we can unlock a plethora of opportunities for everyone. The shipping sector, for instance, creates a stream of jobs and training prospects not only for seafarers on the ship, but in logistics, law, new technologies and AI, economics and others.”

He highlighted that IMO continuously updates its global regulations to keep up with changes in the industry, while carefully considering their impact on Member State economies.

A call for dialogue and action

The event combined a maritime exhibition showcasing innovations in sustainable shipping, with a series of five panel discussions over two days, featuring experts and policy makers:

Panel 1: Our Ocean, Our Obligation, Our Opportunity underscored the links between ocean health, prosperity and governance, while highlighting opportunities in the blue economy and the importance of ocean literacy and youth engagement.

Panel 2: Decarbonization and climate change examined pathways to net-zero emissions in shipping, including the use of alternative fuels, green corridors, carbon pricing and climate-resilient ports.

Panel 3: Actions to address marine plastic litter explored regulatory gaps, onboard waste innovations, port reception facilities and the role of seafarers as “frontline defenders” against plastic pollution.

Panel 4: The BBNJ treaty and shipping reviewed how the new global framework for protecting marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) will affect shipping lanes and high seas governance.

Panel 5: Capacity development for sustainable oceans spotlighted IMO-led projects and programmes designed to bolster capacity among Member States, especially in developing countries, through maritime training, upskilling and ensuring decent work and wellbeing in the green transition.

Republic of Korea to host 2026 WMDPE

The event concluded with the ceremonial handover of the World Maritime Day Parallel Event flag to the Republic of Korea, which will host the 2026 edition in Busan.

The project encompasses the outfitting of shore power systems for newly constructed containerships, with deliveries due to start in the second half of 2026.
It is understood that Cavotec’s solutions can reduce harmful pollutant emissions by a ‘significant’ amount by allowing vessels to connect to shore power while at berth.
In June, Cavotec also joined forces with energy services provider Equans to provide shore power systems for the Port of Antwerp-Bruges cruise terminal.
Beyond Europe, Cavotec was recently also commissioned by the Mohan Mutha Group to deliver the first shore power system in the Maldives.","Cleantech company Cavotec has signed additional contracts worth a total of €9.35 million (approximately $10.9 million) with an undisclosed shipping player to supply shore power systems for container vessels.

According to officials from Cavotec, the two new orders cover both newly built boxships and retrofitting projects.

To be specific, the retrofitting order, valued at around €5.5 million (around $6.4 million), includes the installation of the cleantech company’s shore power solutions on a ‘large’ but undisclosed number of existing ships.

The projects will reportedly be done while the units are in operation between Asia, the United States and Europe. As informed, equipment handovers are planned to commence sometime this year and continue until the end of next year.

Per Cavotec, the second order—worth € 3.8 million (circa $4.4 million)—is an addition to the €8.1 million (roughly $9.4 million) booking that Cavotec had unveiled in May this year. The project encompasses the outfitting of shore power systems for newly constructed containerships, with deliveries due to start in the second half of 2026.

It is understood that Cavotec’s solutions can reduce harmful pollutant emissions by a ‘significant’ amount by allowing vessels to connect to shore power while at berth.

As the company’s representatives have noted further, this also supports compliance with international environmental regulations, such as the Net Zero Framework (NZF) that has been set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Over the past year, Cavotec has shaken hands with several partners seeking to ensure more environmentally friendly operations.

In Europe, the company won three shore power orders (totaling €7 million, or $8.1 million) for Italian ports, aimed at slashing harmful emissions and improving air quality. The deliveries for these initiatives, which were unveiled in January this year, are also slated for 2026.

“These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions.
It’s a view shared by the group of shipowner associations that have today expressed their support of the framework.
Earlier this year, Djibouti and Gabon levied a $17 per tonne of CO2 equivalent charge on 50% of emissions from voyages to and from their ports, echoing the EU emissions trading system.
The group of associations was unequivocal in its support for the framework ahead of next week’s vote, and in its warning of the alternative.","A GROUP of shipowner associations representing around a quarter of global tonnage has thrown its weight behind the Net-Zero Framework set to be voted on at the International Maritime Organization next week.

In a statement given exclusively to Lloyd’s List, signed by the leaders of the Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and Danish Shipping, urged IMO member states to “make history in London” by adopting the Net-Zero Framework at next week’s extraordinary meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee.

“As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale,” the group said.

It offers “concrete mandates” for the reduction of emissions, the associations said, as well as a “pricing mechanism that puts a cost on undercompliance and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard”.

“These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions.

“Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels and technology.”

That view was not shared by another group of shipowners, who instead voiced their opposition to the framework last month.

The group, including the Angelicoussis Group, Bahri, Capital Group, Frontline, GasLog, Hanwha Shipping, George Prokopiou companies, Stolt Tankers and George Economou’s TMS Group, as well as others, said it did not believe “the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonising the maritime industry as per the IMO2023 strategy, nor ensure a level-playing field as intended”.

Crucially, it argued that a failure “to incentivise investment in known and available transition technologies with established standards, and focusing only on unproven ZNZ (zero or near-zero) solutions, will result in the majority of shipping shifting towards pay-to-emit operations”.

They are not the only ones who have poured cold water on the framework in recent weeks.

DNV Maritime chief executive, Knut Orbeck Nilssen, stressed “major concern” over its delivery, questioning why the IMO was putting “roadblocks” in the path of liquified natural gas to decarbonise the industry.

Fellow class society ABS went one step further. Chief executive Christopher Wiernicki called for the IMO to take a “timeout” and rebuild its NZF.

“The IMO needs to approach this as if it were building a ship — systematic, explicit, specific and achievable,” he said.

“The stakes are high, timelines are short, and the current gaps between fuel options are significant.”

Speaking to Lloyd’s List following the dissent from the group of shipowners and class societies, UCL professor Tristan Smith said it was not “particularly surprising or new that some shipowners with various LNG interests are expressing negativity to regulation that will reduce their competitivity, especially when viewed through the ‘coincidence’ of similar ABS and DNV PR from the last few days”.

He said those views were nothing new and had likely already been priced into the positions of member states back in April, when the NZF was initially agreed on MEPC83.

As Lloyd’s List senior reporter Declan Bush said on this week’s edition of the Lloyd’s List Podcast, failing to adopt the NZF does not mean climate regulation will go away. Instead, it will likely mean more rules, not fewer.

It’s a view shared by the group of shipowner associations that have today expressed their support of the framework.

The alternative, they said, “is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks”.

“Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition,” they said.

With that in mind, the group has also called on the EU to align itself with the IMO regulations if they are adopted to avoid “double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden”.

The EU has said that it will align its policy with the IMO’s, but only if it considers the UN body ambitious enough.

That of course leaves the door open for it to continue collecting penalties from FuelEU and the ETS, penalties it has been suggested EU member states might be reluctant to give up.

ECSA European Shipowners (formerly ECSA) said the EU’s policy was in part introduced to nudge the IMO towards action and the adoption of an international system to reduce emissions.

That goal, it said, has now been achieved.

A glimpse of what’s in store should the Net-Zero Framework not be adopted (or if the EU continues to enforce its own rules) has been offered by the action of some African states.

Earlier this year, Djibouti and Gabon levied a $17 per tonne of CO2 equivalent charge on 50% of emissions from voyages to and from their ports, echoing the EU emissions trading system.

The Africa Sovereign Carbon Registry Foundation (the organisation behind the scheme) secretary-general Ahmed Araita Ali said African governments “are not naïve” and said they had the right to require climate accountability from operators working in and around its ports.

Africa makes up 17% of the world’s population but is responsible for just 4% of global emissions and was assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2022 as being the continent most vulnerable to climate change.

“African countries are simply asserting their right to climate sovereignty, and they expect companies from the Global North will respect this autonomy rather than undermine it,” he said.

More countries are expected to join the ASCR’s scheme, and there’s good reason to believe other similarly regional schemes could be set up in the future, should the IMO fail to offer a unified framework.

The group of associations was unequivocal in its support for the framework ahead of next week’s vote, and in its warning of the alternative.

Anything else, it said, would be a “major setback for the green transition” and leave the industry to navigate an “unwieldy patchwork of regional climate regulations”.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/regulation/2025-new-pictures/mepc83-overview.png?rev=51b2f5c8628b4a5abf11605308093d3c,N,,2025-10-08 07:57:35.495645

The two bunker calls will enable the vessel to complete a full round trip along the historic coastal route, supported by the ship’s large battery packs.

The pioneering project coincides with an important fork in the road for global shipping and its future fuel ambitions. It will come just a few weeks after what are expected to be tense and tetchy negotiations at the IMO in London next week, where delegates will decide to adopt the UN agency’s ‘mid-term measures’ on decarbonisation, or not.

Observers and analysts warn that this is by no means a done deal. The US has threatened tariffs on countries that back the IMO's Net Zero Framework next week. And in recent days, groups of heavyweight shipowners and operators in various locations have expressed concern over the IMO’s timetable, practicality, and cost to the industry.

However, Havila Voyages is not deterred. “With this voyage,” declares CEO Bent Martini, “we aim to prove that it is entirely possible to operate the entire coastal route climate-neutrally – something we also believe should be the minimum requirement in the next tender period.”

Since announcing the project in August, the company has worked closely with gas suppliers, Barents Naturgas and Molgas. “We are pleased that the delivery in now confirmed,” says Martini. “The amount of biogas we will have on board is significant and will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from this voyage by more than 90%.”

Martini commends a similar endeavour by Hurtigruten, the other operator on the route. The company, with seven ships deployed on the coastal run, plans to carry out a similar exercise using biodiesel on the hybrid coastal vessel, Richard With, at the end of October. However, he is also keen to point out that biogas offers more significant emissions reduction potential.

“Biogas offers even greater reductions – not only in CO2 emissions but also in local emissions such as nitrogen and sulphur oxides which are reduced by 100% with biogas,” he says. “This has a major impact on local air quality in the 34 ports we visit along the coast.”

“Looking ahead, and by the end of 2028, we aim to operate solely on biogas,” he adds. “This gas will be produced and sourced along the Norwegian coast. It’s short-travelled, will create local jobs, and strengthen the value chains along our route.”

Biogass Norge, an industry association, highlights the sources of biogas – food waste, livestock manure, and fish sludge.

Working with Kanadevia and Yanmar Power Solutions under Japan’s Green Innovation Fund scheme, MOL tested a new methane oxidation catalyst and engine modification system aboard the Reimei, an LNG-fuelled coal carrier panamax (pictured) operating between Japan and Australia.

The demonstration far exceeded the project’s 70% reduction target — and even topped the 93.8% cut seen in land-based trials certified by ClassNK.

Despite LNG’s popularity as an alternative fuel, methane emissions have been the Achilles’ heel undermining its climate credentials.

By proving a near-total elimination of slip in real-world sea conditions, MOL and partners may have handed LNG a crucial lifeline in the decarbonisation debate — especially as new IMO lifecycle standards tighten scrutiny of well-to-wake greenhouse gas performance.

The trials, running through fiscal 2026, will test system durability and catalyst lifespan before full commercial rollout from 2027. MOL says it will push for early adoption of the technology across its LNG-fuelled fleet and share findings to support broader uptake in Japan’s shipping cluster.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, tabled for adoption at next week’s extraordinary MEPC session, would introduce new carbon fees from 2027 as part of the IMO’s pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

In a surprise intervention, Christopher Wiernicki, the departing chairman and CEO of ABS, the third largest shipping classification society in the world, came out against IMO’s planned net zero framework last month.

“Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories. There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation,” Wiernicki said at the launch in London of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook, backing greater support for LNG as a bridging fuel.

“Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways,” Wierniki said.

Peter Keller, chairman of SEA-LNG, a lobby group supporting the super chilled fuel as an alternative shipping fuel, claimed yesterday: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

LNG’s credentials as shipping’s leading alternative fuel have driven much debate for years.

Writing for Splash last week, Elissama Menezes and Andrew Dumbrille, directors of NGO Equal Routes, argued that once the IMO applies its comprehensive life-cycle approach under the net zero framework’s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels – LNG, biomethane, and e-methane – cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives.

Overall, 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in the first nine months of 2025, with LNG-fuelled vessels accounted for the majority of these orders at 121, followed by 43 orders for methanol-fuelled ships, with the remainder made up by LPG carriers (19), ammonia-fuelled vessels (5), and hydrogen-fuelled vessels (4), according to data from DNV.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MOL-Reimei.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:57:45.635265

“We are welcoming to the group a very experienced team, with leading specific expertise in marine fuels and decarbonisation.
“Together, we will scale our clean fuel solutions for the maritime sector at a time of accelerating demand and regulatory tail winds.","Industry coalition SEA-LNG on Tuesday (7 October) underlined recent progress made in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from LNG as a marine fuel, the developments in bunkering of liquefied biomethane and the exponential growth of LNG-powered shipping.

SEA-LNG highlighted the progress ahead of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s extraordinary MEPC/ES.2 session in London next week.

In the last six years, the coalition said its members have been instrumental in the global growth of the LNG-powered fleet and the everyday use of biomethane as a marine fuel.

“This growth in cleaner, greener marine fuel has been matched by technology improvements to cut GHG emissions from LNG,” SEA-LNG said on its website.

“Energy producers have cut well-to-wake emissions by a quarter in the same period. Engine manufacturers have taken practical steps to almost halve the emissions performance of those engines with methane slip. Real progress towards eliminating methane slip has been this decade.”

At London International Shipping Week in September, SEA-LNG said the leadership of ABS and DNV highlighted the importance of LNG, and the pathway it enables through liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) and e-methane.

The industry also cautioned the risk of unintended consequences from regulations for which the supporting guidelines have not yet been fully developed.

“SEA-LNG represents the whole LNG value chain and is the only maritime industry organisation advocating for LNG and the methane decarbonisation pathway. It has for years suggested that regulations be firmly founded on proven science and remain technology neutral,” it said.

“Within this context it is also important that regulators be practical and realistic as to what can be accomplished in any given timeline.”

Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG, said: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, added: “Independent studies by Sphera and Rystad Energy confirm a steady decline in well-to-tank emissions from LNG over the past decade. With further reductions expected as supply chains evolve, and with LBM and e-methane scaling, the pathway is both credible today and vital for the industry’s long-term transition.”

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Captain Rahul Choudhuri, IBIA Board Member & IBIA Asia Regional Board Chair, and President of Strategic Partnerships at VPS, sat down with bunkering publication Manifold Times to offer his take on future challenges of the marine fuels sector.

MT: Heading into IMO 2030, what are the challenges of maintaining bunker fuel quality for safety despite an increasing array of alternative marine fuels? Is the ISO 8217 marine fuel standard enough for end users?

The shipping industry, with 20% of users still on the outdated & withdrawn ISO 8217:2005 edition, is certainly ‘change-averse’. Bunker buyers want a cheaper product [e.g. ISO 8217:2005] but they also need to be aware this is a poorer quality product line.

This slow adoption means the benefits of the new and much improved ISO 8217:2024, which also addresses biofuels for the first time, are not being realised. It’s like a dilemma and a curse and if every new version of an ISO 8217 standard, which is supposed to improve quality and safety, is not really going to be used ultimately the shipping industry will have to pay the price.

And the worst nightmare is when the ship faces engine damage, loses propulsion, stops in midocean and is drifting for several days. This is still happening today and poses a very high safety of life risk.

Another part of ISO 8217 development is that because of the way it is conducted, there are many countries representation involved with necessary compromises when the standard is finally completed.

For example, the latest ISO 8217:2024 standard does not consider biofuel issues such as microbial activity, cold flow, stability, chemical contamination etc.

In contrast, the new Biofuels Standard in Singapore TR140 launched early this year is more comprehensive & covers Biofuels quality more holistically, including future new feedstocks.

To address risks not covered by standard tests, VPS launched the Additional Protection Service for Biofuels testing(APS-BIO) three years ago. This service provides additional protection by testing for a wider range of issues in biofuels, aiming to provide a comprehensive quality control of biofuels that are used for shipping.

MT: Have marine fuel testing labs been able to catch up with risk management of bunker consumption in relation to the evolution of changing bio feedstocks?

Acknowledging the slow adoption of latest ISO 8217 marine fuel standards, VPS has developed a risk management plan for shipowners consuming biofuel bunkers by testing for additional parameters covering Energy Content, Renewable Content, Stability, Cold-Flow Properties, Corrosivity, Microbial Activity & Chemical Contamination. This is part of the APS-BIO package mentioned earlier.

There’s a lot of work that VPS has done in understanding new types of bio feed stock. For example, Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) is now a ‘hot topic’ in certain regions, and we know this is a sustainable feedstock which in principle can benefit the circular economy.

Based on our experience, some CNSL blends have been used without any issues while others have caused engine damage problems, like fuel sludging, injector failure, filter clogging, etc.

So, there is a need for risk management here in how you use such biofuels. What is important is to take proactive measures and do the necessary tests including by blending them into small portions while submitting samples to the lab. More advanced tests like the Fuel Combustion Analyser can be a useful tool as well.

Interestingly, certain blends of CNSL show better ignition & combustion characteristics when blended with Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) when compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This is an example of the benefit by employing risk management and understanding the types of biofuels consumed.

MT: Has the role and challenges of the bunker surveyor changed in the era of MFM, digitalisation and zero carbon/green fuels?

When we look at bunker survey, it is essentially a subset of marine surveying that has been there since the advent of shipping. The primary role of a surveyor is really based on ‘trust but verify’ and that concept is what the surveyor is doing whether it is in bunkering or marine surveying or cargo inspection – so that is here to stay.

But in the context of MFM, the role is changing and for example the surveyor needs to now ensure compliance to ISO 22192 [Bunkering of marine fuel using the Coriolis MFM system] so there is a technologist direction that surveyors need to adopt as well.

The role of the bunker surveyor will be even more important with future alternative marine fuels (such as Methanol) where the level of safety is higher. The types of measurement & sampling are different so in a way the surveyor is moving up the value chain and that must be managed in the industry with proper training etc., and I think those that succeed will be at the forefront of future surveying.

For example, about two years ago there was a methanol bunker delivery in Singapore. VPS was appointed by not only the shipowner but also the product owner. One must be aware that when you do complex fuels like methanol, other parties who operate on a different mindset want to be involved and are interested in this type of product surveying control.

MT: Moving forward, can you forecast the changing role of bunker fuel testing labs past (pre-IMO 2020) and present leading into IMO 2030?

There are several formal studies done which shows the best-case scenario up to 2050 still includes about 50% fossil fuel for global consumption with the rest being taken up with renewable and green fuels. That’s the best case.

I think fossil fuels are here to stay for some time and managing these will continue to be key work for laboratories and testing agencies. Issues such as high Al+Si (Catfines) are not only going away but increasing, and this means better operational control of purification systems onboard vessels.

From a lab point of view, future fuels offer an opportunity to value add at a different level as they are a much more complex and high-end type of products. Those laboratories who are willing to invest and take up positions in these new future marine fuels really will be the winners of tomorrow.

Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) on Tuesday (7 October) said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NH3 Clean Energy (NH3) and Oceania Marine Energy (Oceania) regarding the development of clean ammonia bunkering operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The MoU is to promote collaboration with NH3 and Oceania on the Pilbara Clean Fuels Bunkering Hub initiative, which is Australia’s first ammonia bunkering concept announced by the Pilbara Ports Authority in June this year. MOL will be the world’s first ocean-going shipping company to participate in this initiative.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to the world’s largest iron ore export port and serves as a major port of call for Capesize bulkers.

The Pilbara Ports Authority has entered into a joint development agreement with NH3, which will supply blue ammonia, and Oceania, which will operate the bunkering business, to realize low-carbon ammonia bunkering in the region.

Their goal is to commence bunkering operations for Capesize bulkers at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland by 2030.

This MoU aims for MOL, NH3, and Oceania to collaborate on the transition of iron ore carriers in the Pilbara region to ammonia fuel and the realisation of the WAH2 project.

The WAH2 Project is NH3’s flagship project to supply low-emissions ammonia to the decarbonising powerhouse economies of the Asia Pacific, including Japan and South Korea as well as being a source of decarbonised bunker fuel for powering bulk carriers carrying iron ore from Australia to Asia.

The trio will also jointly propose solutions to Western Australian iron ore suppliers and work to address issues such as safety in ammonia bunkering operations.

MOL will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH NV, which are scheduled to be delivered by China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between 2026 and 2027. These vessels will be chartered by MOL.

MOL is looking to establish a fleet of ammonia duel-fuelled capesize bulk carriers on the West Australia to East Asia trade route and ensure safe ammonia bunkering operations and consider the procurement of ammonia.

As an operator of ammonia dual-fuel vessels, MOL will work for this project to advance considerations regarding safety assurance and ammonia procurement in the Pilbara region.

MOL’s Managing Executive Officer Kazuhiro Takahashi, commented: “We are honored to sign this MoU with NH3 and Oceania today, which will be a vital hub for our ammonia dual-fueled capesize bulkers scheduled to commence operations from 2026.

“This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region. By working closely with our partners, we look forward to building a robust framework for safe ammonia bunkering and advancing sustainable shipping together.”

Molgas Energy Group (Molgas), backed by infrastructure investor InfraVia, has finalised the full acquisition of Titan Energy Holding, parent company of Titan Clean Fuels (Titan), the companies announced on Tuesday (7 October).

The transaction, which follows Molgas’ initial 45% minority stake, marked a major step forward in the Group’s strategic growth in the clean marine fuels sector.

Titan is an independent supplier of liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) and LNG, serving both maritime and industrial customers. Its fleet of small-scale bunkering vessels operates across key global markets, with a strong base in the Northwest European region.

Titan’s LNG bunkering operations will merge with Molgas’ existing operations in Norway and all truck-to-ship supply across Norway and continental Europe will now be combined.

With the integration of Titan, the Molgas Energy Group now operates a fleet of seven LNG bunkering vessels and manages a proprietary network of over 70 road-fuelling stations, with more than 200 points of sale including associated partner stations.

This expanded footprint positions Molgas as a pan-European leader in downstream LNG and bio-LNG solutions for industrial, road transport, and marine customers.

The acquisition comes at a time of accelerating momentum for clean fuels. LNG and bio-LNG are increasingly recognised as scalable, low-emission alternatives that can play a vital role in decarbonizing both shipping and heavy-duty road transport.

With tightening regulations, like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, and therefore growing demand for sustainable energy, Molgas and Titan are well-positioned to lead the transition toward cleaner mobility and logistics.

Following the transaction, Niels den Nijs will lead Molgas’ Marine Business as Executive Vice President, Marine. He will oversee all marine activities, delivering integrated end-to-end ship-to-ship and truck-to-ship bunkering services across Europe.

Sofoklis Papanikolaou, CEO of Molgas, said: “Niels and the Titan team started as true pioneers, showing remarkable innovation and have grown Titan into one of the sector’s most reliable LNG bunkering operators. The success of our initial collaboration laid the groundwork for this acquisition, which significantly extends our reach and capabilities.

“We are welcoming to the group a very experienced team, with leading specific expertise in marine fuels and decarbonisation. Together, we will build a robust platform to deliver LNG and bio-LNG solutions across Europe and beyond.”

Niels den Nijs, CEO of Titan, said: “From the start, our partnership with Molgas was a strong strategic fit and I’m very happy to join their board. By joining forces fully, we substantially strengthen our balance sheet and joint commercial reach.

“Together, we will scale our clean fuel solutions for the maritime sector at a time of accelerating demand and regulatory tail winds. This integration allows us to better serve our long-term customers with an unrelenting focus on our mission: to deliver economical fuel at scale to help decarbonize shipping.”

Athanasios Zoulovits, Partner at InfraVia Capital Partners, said: “As the maritime industry undergoes a major transformation, Titan’s expertise positions Molgas to lead in delivering scalable clean marine fuel solutions. We are proud to support Molgas in its mission to accelerate the energy transition across industrial, mobility, and maritime markets.”

Each milestone is measurable, visible, and achievable — proof that the fleet is learning again to fuel in motion.","From Pearl Harbor’s smoke to the IMO’s clock, the maritime world faces its most decisive refueling mission since 1942.

“The next Guadalcanal of this campaign won’t be a battle at sea — it will be a price curve, a port standard, a policy vote.”

It began in smoke.

Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941. The harbor air was thick with burning oil, flame, and disbelief. Eight battleships took the brunt of the attack — bombs and torpedoes sent five to the bottom within minutes. The Age of the Battlewagon was over, and the Age of the Carrier was born.

The pivot came fast. World War II would not be fought by ships of the line in set-piece battles, but for bloody half-acres at Guadalcanal — a desperate defense of Henderson Field.

The Navy adapted. The U.S. learned to fight an energy war across a vast ocean. Victory came not from tonnage of steel but from fleet oilers, refining capacity, access to crude, food surplus, supply ships, aircraft, destroyers patrolling “the Slot,” and the new reach of carrier power.

Eighty years later, the smoke still hangs in the air — not from Pearl Harbor, but from every ship, port, and refinery that keeps global trade alive. The enemy is different now, but the realization feels the same: the Age of Bunker Oil is ending.

The haze that shrouds today’s world is not the fog of war, but the accumulation of emissions from the twenty-first century’s stretched supply chains. Volatile prices. No swing producer. We’ve optimized our way into fragility.

And so, once again, the world’s fleets are pivoting — this time toward methanol, ammonia, bio-LNG, and drop-in fuels that promise to keep commerce flowing without choking the sky. Not powered by fossil empires, but by innovation and coordination. The old oilers are now electrolyzers; the carriers are container ships; the island bases are ports reborn as Green Corridors. The supply lines stretch from Singapore to Rotterdam, from Los Angeles to Tokyo — and the race to decarbonize is already underway.

The question, as it was in 1942, is simple: Can the fleet pivot fast enough? Will we master change — or will change master us?

The Masters of Change

It takes staggering fuel to keep the sea lanes alive.

Every day, nearly five million barrels of oil are burned to drive 90,000 vessels hauling over a billion tons of freight — a moving continent of combustion. If global energy demand were a world map, shipping alone would be Russia plus China, a superpower of motion.

At the center of the campaign stands the International Maritime Organization, the modern equivalent of wartime Whitehall — issuing the orders, setting targets, demanding accountability. Its campaign plan: net-zero by 2050, and at least 5 percent of maritime energy from alternative fuels by 2030.

The admirals of this fleet wear no medals. They wear hard hats in Singapore, suits in Copenhagen, and grease-stained coveralls in Rotterdam.

Maersk has gone all-in on methanol, ordering twenty dual-fuel ships and investing in plants from Denmark to Egypt — part of a global surge of 190 renewable methanol projects in development or operation by 2030.

Fortescue’s Green Pioneer has completed ammonia bunkering at sea, proving that even the most hazardous molecule on deck can become a zero-carbon contender.

Methanex now offers methanol bunkering from the ARA region to South Korea, fueling the early adopters.

Titan Clean Fuels, freshly acquired by Molgas Energy Group, is expanding LNG and bio-LNG capacity — bridge fuels that keep the convoy moving while the cleaner fleet forms astern.

Even Singapore, the world’s busiest bunkering hub, has barely begun the shift: 880 thousand tons of biofuel blends in 2024, just 1.6 percent of its total bunker sales — a global share of roughly half a percent.

And yet, that’s how every campaign begins — with one pierhead, one pipeline, one spark.

Meanwhile, the only fully commercial drop-in technology today — hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), or HVO — is scaling fast, with projected global capacity of 25 billion liters per year by the early 2030s. Each new plant is another refinery turned from warship to carrier, from carbon to continuity.

They’re not just building ships. They’re building the lifeblood of transformation.

The Arsenal of Innovation

Across the shipyards, the torches burn again — not for armor, but for endurance. Welding arcs flash from Bilbao to Busan. The next fleet is taking shape one molecule at a time.

Drop-in biofuels — HVO, FAME, and bio-HFO — form the first wave. They flow through existing pipelines and burn in existing engines. They buy the fleet time.

Methanol is the campaign’s workhorse: liquid at room temperature, easy to handle, made from biomass, captured CO₂, or renewable hydrogen. Dual-fuel methanol engines are already commercial, proving that cleaner propulsion doesn’t mean slower trade.

Ammonia is the high-risk, high-reward weapon: carbon-free, but volatile. Pure anhydrous ammonia is toxic, corrosive, and potentially lethal in high concentrations. It eats brass, attacks copper, and demands rigorous safety across the value chain. Fortescue’s trials succeeded under strict conditions — a model for what’s coming next.

Renewable methane and bio-LNG provide the transition bridge. Titan and Molgas are scaling production, using existing LNG networks to link present operations to future systems.

Together, these molecules make up the arsenal of innovation — chemistry retooled for persistence. But innovation isn’t only about what fuels the ship. It’s about using less of it.

The Sixth Weapon — Efficiency

The quietest weapon is also the most powerful: efficiency.

While fuels change slowly, efficiency pays immediately. The IMO estimates that improved design and operation could deliver 20 percent of total emissions reduction by 2050 — the low-hanging fruit of the transition.

Every ton of fuel saved stretches the scarce biofuel supply and offsets the lower energy density of e-fuels. Efficiency is the campaign’s logistics arm — the multiplier that makes every molecule count.

The toolkit is broad:

Wind propulsion has returned, with suction sails and Flettner rotors now rising on merchant decks. Three wind-assisted vessels recently entered the Port of Singapore — modern echoes of the clipper age.

Hydrodynamics matter too: cleaner hulls and improved coatings reduce drag by up to ten percent.

Operational measures like slow steaming have already cut consumption significantly across long routes.

Supporting all this are the IMO’s technical mandates — the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new builds, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for existing ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for fleets.

Efficiency doesn’t make headlines, but it wins wars. The cleanest barrel is the one the fleet never burns.

The Front Lines of Transition

Every advance encounters resistance. The maritime pivot now plays out across five active fronts:

The Cost Front. Biofuels and e-fuels remain expensive. Analysts estimate that a carbon price of €100–150 per ton of CO₂ is needed to close the gap with fossil fuel. Until then, every voyage is a calculation between courage and cost. Yet among non-fossil options, biofuels remain the most cost-effective bridge to decarbonization.

The Feedstock Front. Aviation, trucking, and shipping are raiding the same pantry of biomass and renewable power. There’s not enough to feed every fleet, and competition is fierce.

The Infrastructure Front. Ports are transforming into fueling bases for the clean campaign. Meeting renewable-fuel demand by 2030 — 18–28 million tonnes — will require around €18 billion in new infrastructure investment.

The Technical Front. Drop-in fuels vary in stability and composition. Some, like FAME, are acidic and can wear engine components. Pyrolysis oils are unstable without hydrotreatment, their high oxygen and water content making them corrosive and short-lived. Compatibility management turns every ship into a floating lab.

The Policy Front. The IMO charts the course, but regional frameworks still differ. The key advance is the Well-to-Wake standard — measuring emissions across the entire life cycle, from production to exhaust. The 2030 goal: 40 percent less carbon intensity than 2008, with at least 5 percent — striving for 10 percent — of maritime energy from alternative fuels.

Despite the headwinds, the fleet is moving. DHL and Henkel will use Sustainable Marine Fuels for 9,000 TEUs of freight next year via Book & Claim accounting — cutting CO₂e by 85%.

And in Singapore, that 1.6 percent biofuel share is doubling yearly. In the fuel war, doubling counts.

The Road to Victory

The clock is ticking — 2030 is less than six years away.

By then, the IMO’s targets must be met or reset: 5 to 10 percent of maritime energy from alternative fuels, 40 percent less carbon intensity, measured Well-to-Wake. The rules are written, the tide is running, and the fleet must now prove it can keep up with its own ambitions.

Victory in this new Pacific won’t come from a single triumph, but from milestones — proof points on the road from ambition to endurance.

Volume.

When global biofuel and e-fuel bunkering passes 10 million tonnes a year—up from barely one million today—the fleet will have crossed from tokenism into transformation.

Demonstration.

When the first ammonia-fueled vessel completes a commercial voyage without incident and under full regulatory approval, zero-carbon shipping will move from theory to fact.

Affordability.

When sustainable marine fuel drops below $1,000 per tonne—roughly parity with fossil MGO at a carbon price near €150 per ton CO₂—the transition will no longer depend on virtue or subsidy.

Infrastructure.

When twenty major ports can bunker methanol, ammonia, or bio-LNG under harmonized standards, the arteries of clean trade will be open.

Policy Stability.

When governments align public incentives, shipowner obligations, and carrier economics, the campaign will have its Grand Alliance—industry, government, and society pulling in one direction.

Efficiency.

When global fuel demand bends downward year-on-year, the war will be half won before the next molecule of green fuel is burned.

Each milestone is measurable, visible, and achievable — proof that the fleet is learning again to fuel in motion.

Investigation of Other Alternative Sustainable Fuels Available According to Tan, methanol has become an interesting fuel alternative for the maritime industry.
The focus of future efforts should be on the decarbonization of global shipping.
The industry’s future will be built on the balance between the economic reality of the shipping operations and the environmental decarbonization plan.
As noted by Tan, this balance must achieve fuel and technological shifts in a decarbonization framework and reasonable execution timelines.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization (GCMD) has taken the lead in advancing the strategies that will achieve net-zero carbon emissions for the global shipping sector. As stated by the GCMD Chief Projects Officer, Wee Meng Tan, “a single, universal alternative fuel” will not effectively meet the emissions reduction “holy grail” for the shipping sector. As such, GCMD continues to pursue decarbonization pathways that will sustain a positive transition for the sector in declining carbon emissions. Unlike the fuel-agnostic competitors in the industry, GCMD embraces all forms of technology.

Tan insisted that fossil fuels, including LNG, “will” remain for the foreseeable future, and that the long lifespans of ships will keep fossil fuel “a part of the fuel mix” for decades to come. Tan argues that the necessary scaling of alternative fuel technologies will take “longer” than the ships and that the maritime sector will have to use more “energy-efficient” technologies and “carbon capture” solutions to decarbonize.

The Challenges of Fuel Transition

While analyzing maritime fuel futures, Tan pointed out that it is more important to plan transition pathways, rather than targeting a single end-state for fuels, as there will not be a single end-state for fuels.

Under the net-zero framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), fossil LNG will allow shipowners to avoid penalties until 2035, at the latest. After that, it is expected that shipowners will adopt more sustainable alternatives, with bio-LNG substantially cutting emissions. Tan Augments that bio-LNG could be produced cheaper than many biofuels, but is constrained by competing feedstock demands from power plants that are trying to produce greener grid electricity.

The Promise and Challenges of Bio-LNG

As Tan describes, the strongest argument for Bio-LNG is its ability to serve as a drop-in fuel for existing fleets. This feature is appealing to shipowners who’d rather not spend money retrofitting an engine, but replacing retrofitting. Tan went on to explain that the widespread adoption of bio-LNG is met with challenges, especially the limited availability of feedstock. Biofuels, generically speaking, fall under these challenges; limited feedstock, and from competing sectors, supply constrained overall.

To overcome this issue, GCMD is looking into third-generation biofuels like crude algae oil, biodiesel from animal tallow, and cashew nutshell liquid. These new fuels show potential as substitutes for conventional biofuels, and as Tan mentioned, they can likely increase the sustainable feedstock for maritime.

Book-and-Claim Model as a Solution

There is the challenge of the limited availability of bio-LNG at all ports, which can make it impractical for shipowners in biofuel-scarce locations. GCMD is looking into the book-and-claim model for this issue. Under this system, shipowners can buy bio-LNG certificates that claim the green attributes of biofuel, even if the biofuel is not physically supplied to the ship. Instead, the ship’s bio-LNG is released into the broader gas grid. This way, shipowners can claim the emission reduction benefits of biofuel and fulfill regulations even if they don’t have bio-LNG at every bunkering station.

Investigation of Other Alternative Sustainable Fuels Available

According to Tan, methanol has become an interesting fuel alternative for the maritime industry. Most importantly, methanol is gaining popularity with vessels like the new Disney Adventure, which is set to launch from Singapore this year. This ship will be “methanol ready”. Clearly, this shows that methanol fuel is increasingly becoming a viable option for cruise lines. Tan explains that fuel cells, while providing a clean energy option, lack scale and are more appropriate for auxiliary or hotel loads than main propulsion.

Tan also mentioned a lesser-known alternative, combined gas turbine, electric, and steam (COGES) plants. This approach is akin to what the national electric grids are utilizing. However, while there is potential for this to be utilized within the maritime sector, limitations will always be present in the form of poor fuel efficiency while operating under 50 percent loads.

Economic and Operational Realities

Tan noted that there are several important factors that cruise lines have to keep in mind when switching to alternative fuels; these are the prices and the availability of different fuels, the cost of modifying the engine, and the risk that the chosen fuel will only work for part of the vessel’s operational lifespan. These factors will likely dictate how rapidly the shipping sectors will be able to decarbonize.

Conclusion: The Challenges Ahead

The complexity of the road to net-zero carbon gives the shipping industry no easy alternatives. GCMD maintains the primary focus on the shipping industry’s operational and risk exposures by pursuing various vessel decarbonization pathways, including methanol, biofuels, and carbon capture. The industry is clearly moving, perhaps slowly, toward the decarbonization of its operations. The focus of future efforts should be on the decarbonization of global shipping.

The industry’s future will be built on the balance between the economic reality of the shipping operations and the environmental decarbonization plan. As noted by Tan, this balance must achieve fuel and technological shifts in a decarbonization framework and reasonable execution timelines.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Singapore-Leads-Shipping-Sustainability-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:11.001478

Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport technical advisers stress that the shipping industry risks locking itself into unsustainable pathways if biofuels are rewarded by the Net-Zero Framework.

“First-generation biofuels come from food and feed crops. That competes with food supply and land, which is risky for developing countries,” said Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport (MCST) legal adviser John Kautoke. “Even advanced biomass is supply-constrained, and aviation is already targeting it for sustainable aviation fuels.

“For our region, importing those fuels would just add cost layers. We need solutions suited to Pacific realities — wind-propulsion, high-efficiency designs, and scalable e-fuels from renewable electricity — rather than locking in costly imports.”

The Pacific submission, which is co-sponsored by Fiji, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, to the IMO calls for a clear, stringent definition of “zero and near-zero fuels” (ZNZs) that prioritises technologies capable of scaling to net zero by 2050, such as wind propulsion and e-fuels from renewable electricity, while explicitly excluding biomass feedstocks.

IMO members are meeting next week in London to vote on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework.

Experts note that while biofuels can play a limited role in the transition, they are unlikely to meet the sector’s long-term needs. The aviation sector is already competing for the same feedstocks, creating a high risk that scarce resources will be diverted away from shipping.

Climate science underscores the urgency of focusing on scalable, long-run solutions. The latest assessments show global warming has already averaged 1.54°C above pre-industrial levels in 2024, with highly disruptive tipping points that are likely to be triggered between 1.5–2°C. “Investing in fuels that cannot scale wastes precious time we do not have,” Kautoke warns.

Instead, Pacific countries are pushing the IMO to design the Net-Zero Fund’s reward system to incentivise true zero-emission options – using mechanisms like auctions or contracts-for-difference to provide certainty for investors while ensuring accessibility for low-income countries.",,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:17.272177

Trinidad and Tobago can cash in on Net-zero framework

Ken Chee Hing

THIS country may see economic benefits if the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF) becomes law. The framework’s intention is to see a reduction of emissions in the maritime sector.

It was approved in April and is set for adoption this month pending a vote which will take place during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting from October 14-17.

108 members are eligible to vote, including ten from Caricom. If adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

The framework seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target.

A news release from the Trinidad and Tobago Energy Chamber’s website on October 6 said that key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual GHG intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero emission fuels and support a just transition.

The Framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

If adopted, this creates opportunities for countries like TT to seek new markets for petrochemical products produced domestically.

Essentially, the NZF encourages the use of cleaner fuels or technologies. If a ship’s GHG fuel intensity is too high, it will pay a price corresponding to the greenhouse gases it emits above certain thresholds. Conversely, ships will be rewarded for using cleaner fuels.

Methanol, ammonia, and LNG can be used as maritime fuels under this framework since they emit less when consumed than traditional diesel or heavy fuel oil. This provides opportunities for producers in TT and it also opens up the possibility for low-carbon fuel bunkering.

These fuels however are are typically three to four 4 times more expensive today but will reduce over time with increased production and lower technology costs.

Some countries in the Caribbean are concerned that the NZF will significantly push up their shipping costs, which are obviously a very significant issue for small islands states.

The Methanol Institute has recently stated that, “Methanol producers are ready to deliver. Today, there is already enough methanol available to fuel the ships in operation.

The Ammonia Energy Association has also weighed in and said that The Net-zero Framework is a good step in the right direction.",https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24465463.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:27.542053
