the corridor is expected to support approximately 12–15 voyages annually, with each voyage lasting around 40 days.
To ensure long-term fuel availability, an offtake agreement for B24 sustainable biofuel has been established in Rio Grande.
The initiative builds on a 2024 Norway–Brazil memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing a green transatlantic shipping corridor.
This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping,” said the Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Anders Bjelland Eriksen.","In the UK, Safety4sea reported that Odfjell has established a green shipping corridor between Brazil and Europe, enabling vessels to complete the 5,000-nautical-mile route with significantly reduced emissions through the use of certified B24 biodiesel.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.
Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.
Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.
Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.","EcoLog has taken an important step in the development of a liquid hydrogen import terminal in the Port of Amsterdam.

This week, the company signed an agreement in Tokyo with a group of technology partners that will supply equipment for both the future import terminal and the vessels that will transport the hydrogen.

The consortium partners,Ebara Corporation, Fukui Seisakusho, Kobe Steel, and TB Global Technologies, will provide equipment and technical solutions for EcoLog’s liquid hydrogen vessels as well as for the planned import terminal in Amsterdam.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.

It will be the first terminal of this scal worldwide. The terminal is expected to become operational around 2030 and, in its initial phase, will have an annual throughput capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and 1.8 million tonnes of liquid CO₂.

Liquid hydrogen can be transported efficiently and safely via pipelines, inland shipping, rail, and road.

Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.

Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.

Both maritime transport and terminal operations require highly specialized equipment.

EcoLog has therefore entered into a framework agreement with its partners to jointly develop and integrate this equipment into the vessels and the terminal. This includes, among other things:

Pumps for loading and unloading liquid hydrogen

Safety relief valves to reduce tank pressure in emergency situations

Heat exchangers to convert liquid hydrogen into gaseous form, enabling onward transport via pipelines after arrival

Marine loading arms for the safe loading and unloading of vessels

Based on the current planning, the company is working towards realization of the terminal in 2030.

The import of green hydrogen is essential for the development of the European hydrogen economy and for the decarbonization of industry.

Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.

The development of the terminal in the Port of Amsterdam aligns with this international cooperation and with the broader ambition to supply North-West Europe with green hydrogen.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EL2501-S01A-PH1-250616.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:57:09.692176

GHG-SMART Boosts Shipping Decarbonization in SIDS, LDCs

Maritime decarbonization in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) gained new momentum with the conclusion of the 2025 annual training cycle of GHG-SMART programme.

A total of 23 maritime professionals from 13 SIDS and LDCs completed a year-long capacity-building programme combining online and in-person training, engagement webinars, and theoretical assignments. The programme covered regulatory, policy, technological, and financial aspects of shipping decarbonization.

Participating countries included Bangladesh, Belize, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mauritius, Nepal, Seychelles, Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Vanuatu.

Rajelle Barbe, Environment, Social Impact and Safety Manager from Seychelles said: ""Seeing real-world solutions and learning alongside peers from SIDS and LDCs gave me a much clearer picture of what's possible for our port. The most valuable part was the peer exchange - hearing how others are tackling similar challenges and getting practical, honest advice from experts in the field, especially on financing opportunities which is crucial for our port"".

Final 2025 GHG-SMART Practical Training in Busan

The programme concluded in November 2025 in Busan, Republic of Korea, with the final GHG-SMART Practical Training. Participants took part in interactive sessions, hands-on workshops and field visits to maritime institutions and industrial sites.

The event brought international experts from IMO, the World Maritime University (WMU), the Green Climate Fund, the World Bank, Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure of Samoa and the Korea Maritime Transportation Safety Authority to share their institutional knowledge.

Esther Ken, Marine Pollution Officer from Vanuatu Maritime Safety Authority said: ""At the national level, the lessons learned will help inform strategies to modernize port operations, adopt cleaner technologies, and strengthen regulatory frameworks, ensuring that our maritime sector remains competitive while reducing its environmental footprint.""

GHG-SMART aims to support participants from SIDS and LDCs with the tools for them to identify and implement best practices aligned with the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy within their national contexts.

With the completion of the 2025 training cycle, more than 80 participants from 47 SIDS and LDCs have now been trained under the GHG-SMART programme.

The programme also awards full scholarships to the top performing candidates each year to pursue master's degree at WMU on maritime energy management to further advance their expertise.

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today launched a new inquiry into fuel smuggling and money laundering reportedly orchestrated by Mexican drug cartels, by requesting information from 7 shipping companies about their operations and safeguards against illegal fuel trafficking.

“Drug cartels are reportedly siphoning billions of dollars’ worth of fuel to bolster their criminal empires, while they also bring drugs and violence into the United States. I want to be sure both shipping companies and the U.S. government are doing everything in their power to shut off this revenue stream. These letters are the first step in my effort to learn more about how these criminal networks operate, and where existing controls are failing,” Wyden said.

News reports this year indicate that drug cartels have diverted billions of dollars in diesel and other fuel shipments to avoid Mexican customs and operate an illegal fuel network in Mexico. Those proceeds strengthen drug cartels, which are major manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs into the United States, with responsibility for murders and brutal violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Trump has diverted law enforcement officials and resources away from ongoing investigations in order to round up immigrants with little regard for due process or prioritizing truly dangerous criminals.

Wyden requested information from TORM, Teekay, Scorpio Tankers, NORDEN, International Seaways, Frontline and CMB.Tech.

“Cracking down on this illicit industry is critical to blunt cartels’ ability to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, cocaine, and other deadly drugs in the United States, and the international shipping industry must play its part to end this lawless practice,” Wyden wrote in his letters to the shippers.
