The newbuilds will support Union Maritime’s strategy of surpassing the 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (based on 2008 levels) required by the IMO’s 2030 indicative checkpoint. The use of wind-assisted propulsion will help to ensure that the owner fulfils the IMO requirement that at least 5% of the energy used by 2030 is from zero- or near-zero-emission sources.

The vessels will each be fitted with two 3.5m-diameter Rotor Sails, with heights of 20.5m and 24m, respectively. The Rotor Sails will be EX-rated, fulfilling the safety requirements for use on vessels carrying potentially explosive substances. Vessel and rotor sail integration design was conducted by China-based ship design and engineering consultancy Odely Marine.

Union Maritime is a long-standing advocate of wind-assisted propulsion and has explored multiple wind technologies across its fleet. Their decision to partner with Anemoi for this project reflects their continued commitment to innovation and their confidence in solutions that deliver strong operational performance and long-term value. Union Maritime selected Anemoi’s Rotor Sail technology for this project following a detailed review of available solutions. Anemoi adapted the previously prepared foundation arrangements to accommodate its system, ensuring optimal performance and seamless integration.

Global container line Hapag-Lloyd and regional operator North Sea Container Line won ZEMBA’s second tender, announced Wednesday, enabling member companies to reduce ocean transport emissions through scalable alternative fuels.

According to ZEMBA, the deployment will cover an initial 20 billion tonne nautical miles of transport activity over three years, with some members extending to five years, resulting in at least approximately 120,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abated starting in 2027. Member companies participating in the initiative include Amazon, Patagonia, Tchibo, Beiersdorf, Brooks Running, IKEA, Nike, and others.

Under the arrangement, Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships operating on trans-oceanic lanes, while North Sea Container Line will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership serving a northern European trade lane. Both fuels will be produced using low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy sources and are designed to deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

The award comes just days after Hapag-Lloyd ordered eight dual-fuel methanol containerships at Chinese shipbuilder CIMC Raffles to in a deal valued at more than USD 500 million, marking the company’s first newbuild project utilizing the fuel. The 4,500 TEU vessels are scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029, and will feature state-of-the-art dual-fuel methanol engines capable of achieving up to 30 percent greater efficiency than older ships in the same size class. When operating on methanol propulsion, the fleet is expected to save up to 350,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.

Hapag-Lloyd’s current fleet includes 37 dual-fuel LNG ships either in operation or planned, with the ability to also run on biomethane.

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

Bente Hetland, CEO of North Sea Container Line, expressed similar commitment. “We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics. With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels.”

This second procurement follows ZEMBA’s inaugural tender in 2024, which focused on waste-based biomethane and was also awarded to Hapag-Lloyd. The latest tender specifically targets hydrogen-derived e-fuels to kickstart a new market for scalable, low-carbon alternatives essential for achieving an economically viable maritime clean energy transition.

The announcement reinforces the role of credible, third-party verified book and claim chain of custody systems in activating early voluntary corporate demand for new technology solutions. ZEMBA continues its partnership with Katalist, the first nonprofit maritime book and claim system, to enable demand from buyers worldwide to flow to suppliers ready for deployment regardless of geographic constraints.

ZEMBA, which serves as a first-of-its-kind buyers group within the maritime sector, aims to accelerate commercial deployment of clean energy-powered shipping and enable economies of scale beyond what individual freight buyers could accomplish alone. The Aspen Institute Energy and Environment Program serves as the ZEMBA secretariat, with technical and legal support provided by the Center for Green Market Activation, Lloyd’s Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub, and law firm Pillsbury.

The alliance expects to finalize the full measurable impact of its second tender in 2026 as existing and new members complete contracting with the winning carriers.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFIF.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 12:57:13.902628

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority.
“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.
While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.
“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.","This is part of the COMMODITIES 2026 series, where our reporters bring you key themes that will drive commodities markets in 2026.

Tightening EU rules on greenhouse gas emissions are expected to prompt demand for alternative marine energy, but European suppliers are not necessarily well-positioned to harness the additional requirements due to a complex regulatory landscape.

The EU’s FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy’s GHG intensity have been in force since January 2025, and Brussels will increase the coverage ratio of maritime emissions from 70% in 2025 to 100% in 2026 under its Emissions Trading System, while also including methane and nitrous oxide in emissions accounting.

Many shipping and bunker industry participants expect shipping companies to consume more LNG and biofuels for compliance requirements, and that their bunkering points will be driven by pricing and logistical needs.

The two fuels are more available than other forms of energy with lower GHG emissions than conventional oil-based fuels, and Albrecht Grell, managing director of consultancy OceanScore, said their popularity will only grow due to increased financial incentives.

Average delivered bunker costs in Rotterdam were $18.3/Gigajoule for LNG, $19/Gj for 0.1%-sulfur marine gasoil and $22.8/Gj for B30 bioblend with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in intra-EU trades over January-November, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab), when the ETS was taken into consideration.

If the 2026 rules were to apply, MGO — the preferred compliance option among conventional fuels in EU waters due to sulfur limits — would be priced at a wide premium to LNG of $1/Gj assuming the ship has a slow-speed, two-stroke engine and a narrower discount to B30 of $3.3/Gj.

“We see an increasing uptake [of the fuels] throughout this year,” Grell told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy. “The increased commercial benefit will help to further support this trend.”

Globally, classification society DNV expects LNG demand from the shipping sector to grow from 906 petajoules in 2024 to 1,032 Pj in 2025 and 1,196 Pj in 2026, and biomass demand to increase from 52.5 Pj in 2024 to 80.4 Pj in 2025 and 115 Pj in 2026.

LNG

Europe’s LNG bunker market has seen strong activity through 2025, buoyed by calmer sentiment in the wider LNG complex, keeping prices competitive aside from FuelEU Maritime.

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority. Volumes were up by 34% from the second quarter and by almost 23% from Q3 2024.

“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.

Despite methane slip worries concerning LNG-powered ships, Bunker Holding’s head of LNG, Edward Glossop, said the inclusion of methane in the ETS accounting from 2026 is “no game changer” for LNG bunkering’s business case.

Total fuel and compliance costs for the worst environmentally performing ship with a four-stroke LNG-fueled engine would still be $120-$150/metric ton lower than one burning MGO in intra-EU trades, according to Glossop’s estimates made when applying the 2026 rules to early-December fuel prices.

“Global LNG supply is of course increasing rapidly, and all forward curves suggest that prices will be even more competitive for the coming years,” said Glossop, adding that the forecast LNG barge tightness has yet to manifest in Europe.

Meanwhile, market participants said bio-LNG bunker demand has also been on the rise, and burning the low-carbon fuel could generate large quantities of FuelEU Maritime surplus units, which could be sold to other shipping companies via a pooling arrangement. Gas supplier Gasum quoted the surplus unit at Eur233/mtCO2e ($270/mtCO2e) on Dec. 15.

While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.

Low-carbon energy

Conventional ships can only burn biofuels to meet EU compliance requirements, often on a drop-in basis. Bunker trader KPI OceanConnect estimates FuelEU Maritime alone has led to a gain of 600,000-700,000 mt/y in biobunker demand on a B100 basis.

“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.

But Europe’s biobunker markets are facing a shake-up, with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III transposed into national laws across member states.

The Netherlands, home to the largest European biobunkering port, Rotterdam, is set to implement an Emission Reduction Units system as part of RED III from Jan. 1, 2026, with regulatory designs that, traders said, could drive up marine biofuel prices.

Further complicating the matter is that Belgium and the Netherlands have planned together to treat UCOME, the most popular feedstock in biobunker fuels, as a fossil fuel under their RED III implementation, but Belgium’s transposition date has not been fully confirmed. In Germany, the international shipping sector is excluded from RED III.

“Predicting what effect RED III will have on the market is tricky,” said Jesper Lindegaard Sorensen, global head of alternative fuels at KPI OceanConnect. “We will have to wait and see.”

Singapore has overtaken Rotterdam as the world’s largest biobunkering hub with its ability to offer more lower prices to container lines in Asia-Europe trades, and Sorensen said the world’s largest bunker port is “the obvious candidate” to take more volumes should Rotterdam’s competitiveness be eroded.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for B30 with 30% UCOME and 70% very low sulfur fuel oil was $709/mt in Singapore in November, and $756/mt in Rotterdam, according to Platts assessments.

For intra-EU trades, other bunker traders said the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region will remain a top biobunkering center due to a well-established logistics network that allows suppliers to offer grades up to B100, but ports in Spain, Italy, France and Turkey are also increasing their capabilities.

“Other locations are setting up a biofuel supply chain … we will be more diverse,” Cardullo said.

Among other fuels, a growing number of ships that can run on green methanol are hitting the waters, but shipping professionals said their uptake remains constrained by high prices and limited availability.

Shipbroker Braemar estimated 87 methanol-capable ships were in operation as of Dec. 10, while at least another 300 are due for delivery in the coming years.

Meanwhile, green methanol costs three times more than MGO, and its production currently stands at 2.2 million mt/y compared with the 60 million mt/y projected to be required by 2040, according to MPC Containerships.",,N,,2025-12-17 02:57:04.347705

The product achieves a greenhouse gas reduction rate of over 85% throughout its life cycle, has passed EU ISCC EU certification and quantitative detection by the US Beta Laboratory for C14, enabling full-chain carbon traceability from ""raw material to product.""

It is understood that the global shipping industry accounts for 3% of total global carbon emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a clear goal for the shipping industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Policies such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) also impose higher requirements for the decarbonization of shipping fuels. The CIMC ENRIC Zhanjiang Project precisely addresses this global demand for emission reduction. Leveraging Zhanjiang's abundant agricultural and forestry waste resources, the project has achieved breakthroughs in key biomass gasification technologies through independent innovation, establishing a closed-loop industrial chain for the ""high-value utilization of agricultural and forestry waste."" This not only supports regional rural revitalization and the ""Dual Carbon"" goals but also provides green fuel that meets international standards for the shipping industry.

Capitalizing on Zhanjiang Port's geographical advantages and biomass resource endowment, the project has established South China's first green methanol ""production-storage-transportation-application"" supply chain ecosystem. It includes a 30,000 m³ methanol product storage tank and dedicated loading/unloading berths, achieving a one-hour closed loop for ""production-storage-transportation."" It has also built a ""same-day delivery"" bunkering network for ships in the Greater Bay Area, becoming the green methanol export point closest to international ports like Hong Kong and Singapore, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of fuel transportation. The project adopts an integrated model of ""equipment + process + operation,"" with key core equipment being independently controllable. The high-quality turnkey construction was completed by CIMC ENRIC Engineering Technology Co., Ltd.

At the commissioning ceremony, representatives from renowned global green industry chain enterprises attended, including Maersk Group, CMA CGM Group, Germany's BASF Group, China Marine Bunker Co., Ltd., and Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co., Ltd. In his speech, Gao Xiang stated that the launch of the Zhanjiang Green Methanol Plant marks South China's emergence as a pivotal hub in the global green shipping sector. CIMC ENRIC will continue to supply green methanol that meets the highest international standards to markets such as Southeast Asia and Europe, collaborating with upstream and downstream partners to reshape the models and regulations of the clean fuel industry. Yang Xiaohu, Executive Director & President of CIMC ENRIC, pointed out that the completion and operation of the project have laid a solid foundation for the large-scale commercial application of biomass energy, offering a more efficient and economical new option for decarbonizing the shipping industry.

Representatives from enterprises such as Sinopec CNOOC Bunker Supply, Denmark's Bunker Holding, and industry media Argus also delivered speeches at the ceremony, jointly envisioning new prospects for the development of green shipping. As a significant breakthrough in the large-scale development of China's green methanol industry, the project is expected to inject strong momentum into the green fuel sector both in China and globally, leading the global shipping industry toward a new journey of zero-carbon and healthy development.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-12-16 23:57:52.325032

The Valencia-Palma route will be the first green corridor between two Spanish ports.
Meanwhile, the shipping company Odfjell has launched the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe with its chemical tankers using certified sustainable biofuel.
The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.
This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping.","Three shipping entities have signed a major agreement last week to develop the first green maritime corridor in Spain. The shipping company Baleària, with a fleet portfolio of ferries/fast ferries, and the ports of Palma and Valencia are teaming up to promote the decarbonisation of the maritime-port sector.

The initiative aims to decarbonisation the sector, with a target to operate with zero emissions on this route by 2030, using biofuels in the two Baleària vessels serving passenger and freight transport along this line.

Baleària plans to decarbonise the Valencia-Palma route by 2030, dedicating two of its ships to this line, equipped with dual-engines that will run entirely on biogas by that year. The company will also install onboard batteries to provide renewable electricity for auxiliary use during navigation, along with OPS connection systems in the ships.

For their part, the port authorities of Valencia and the Balearic Islands, as part of their decarbonisation plans, will accelerate the construction of infrastructures for charging batteries in port, and will explore the availability and development of low-carbon fuel supplies.

The chairman of Baleària, Adolfo Utor, stressed that this is a pioneering project for Spain’s maritime decarbonisation: “It is a sustainable competitive bet, which will be two decades ahead of the goal of zero emissions by 2050. The Valencia-Palma route will be the first green corridor between two Spanish ports. This public-private agreement will mean a significant advance in the mobility of passengers and essential goods between the mainland and the Balearic Islands”.

Baleària is a shipping group in Spain with more than 25 years of history in the maritime transport of passengers, vehicles and goods.

Meanwhile, the shipping company Odfjell has launched the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe with its chemical tankers using certified sustainable biofuel.

“We have established an offtake of B24 sustainable biofuel blend in Rio Grande to secure long-term fuel availability,” the company said.

The corridor will operate 12-15 voyages per year, each lasting around 40 days.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.

“We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,” highlighted CEO Harald Fotland. “Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.”

Fotland emphasized that this is not a one-off demonstration but a long-term commitment.

The Norwegian minister of climate and environment, Anders Bjelland Eriksen, stated: “We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions.

“Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions. The ocean is the link in trade between Brazil and Norway. This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping. We will continue this work with the aim that more vessels can gradually adopt a wider range of low- and zero-emission fuels.”",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BALEARIA-DECEMBER.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 02:57:08.876158

In April, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) provisionally endorsed a world first industry-wide carbon-pricing mechanism for the maritime sector, the Net-Zero Framework (Framework).

In October, a vote on adoption of the Framework was dramatically and unexpectedly postponed.

A new picture is emerging where the underlying momentum remains, but regulatory timelines and price reference points are hazy. The potential implications for the shipping industry remain profound.

What you need to do

In the face of the regulatory uncertainty and market developments, the approach of industry players should be:

Data driven: accurate emissions data is key to managing both risks and opportunities so establish a single source of truth for activity and fuel data across fleets, align data definitions (eg, fuel types, LHV, density, cargo metrics) and incorporate near-real-time visibility of emissions drivers (eg, speed, weather routing, hull condition, engine load). In this way, gain visibility over abatement opportunities. Commercial software solutions are there to support this process.

Flexible: an agile approach is essential to respond adequately to market and regulatory developments. Shipowners can, for example, undertake current state assessments to identify the portion of their fleet that will be captured by legislation, the expectations of key customers and stakeholders and commercial arrangements that come up for renewal. The information can be integrated into scenario planning, regulatory playbooks and risk controls.

Strategic: a strategic approach that blends operational measures, retrofits, and selective newbuilds aligned to multiple fuel pathways is vital, prioritising fuel-flexible and upgrade-ready vessels and technologies to hedge technology and policy uncertainty.

Collaborative: given dependency on new technologies for net-zero aligned emission reductions of shipping, shipping companies and stakeholders should work together to develop low-carbon pathways and enhance emission transparency. Ecosystem collaboration via coalitions (eg, Getting to Zero Coalition, First Mover Coalition) or green corridor initiatives (62 as of 30 October 20241) will aggregate zero or net-zero fuel demand and secure early access to alternative bunkering.

Industry Impact and Strategic Considerations

A global carbon price would have a direct impact on freight costs. Existing global and regional regulatory regimes are already adding compliance cost for charterers and cargo owners. Are these charges a fuel cost - or a function of the profile of the ship as a capital asset? The philosophical divide is most acute in longer term chartering.

Regional schemes, such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) already and the impending UK ETS expanding to include maritime emissions from 1 July 2026, have more stringent requirements than those proposed by the IMO. Regional schemes may be affirmed, and new schemes emerge, rather than all such schemes being under pressure to yield to an IMO global scheme.

Owners still need to weigh the costs and benefits of retrofitting existing vessels and of investing in newbuilds designed for low-carbon operation. These equations are nuanced according to ships' trading patterns. Discerning price elasticity in freight markets has been complicated as a result of geopolitical trade uncertainty.

The compliance and penalty history of vessels will still become a factor in asset valuation and due diligence, particularly in the second-hand market. It remains to be seen how strongly IMO's existing short term measures will be enforced in practice. A patchy global compliance picture could attract more polluting assets to low or no enforcement regions.

The need for robust scenario modelling, investment in new technologies, and close engagement with supply chain partners is as pressing as ever, and extends beyond fuel and engine choices to carbon capture, carbon offsetting and to ports that must determine upon new bunkering facilities and fuel sources.

The future of the Framework can play out in a few different ways

In the lead-up to the next vote, technical work continues within the IMO, with ongoing development of guidelines to support the Framework. So does dialogue, consensus building and detailed implementation planning. Industry bodies such as Maritime Industry Australia Limited have expressed disappointment at the delay but see the opportunity to refine the Framework, eliminate areas of uncertainty and improve the eventual regime. At organisations such as the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), pilots and studies continue at pace. GCMD acknowledges the incremental nature of such a complex transition, and the need for holistic engagement across the commercial maritime ecosystem.

Scenarios ahead include:

Eventual adoption: after a year of negotiations, IMO member states manage to reach consensus and formally adopt the Framework at the next IMO session. A consistent, binding global regime for emissions regulation is seen to reward early movers and drives investments in low-carbon technologies. Some industry actors must confront the impact of stricter requirements sooner.

Further delays: consensus remains elusive in 2026, leading to further regulatory fragmentation. Individual countries or regions continue to implement their own rules, including levies. A global patchwork elevates compliance risks, massively increases administrative work, and starts to distort global trade routes as operators avoid or price up sectors with stricter regimes. The incentive is generally to postpone investment or adopt a minimum-compliance approach.

Status quo: while formal adoption is stalled, work on technical guidelines and voluntary measures continues within the IMO and among industry alliances. Some leading shipowners may set and pursue more ambitious emission reduction targets, supported by purpose-driven finance, or under customer pressure. ""Free riders” undermine collective impact and climate ambitions. Uncertainty dampens sector-wide investments and slows the deployment of transformative solutions.

In summary, while eventual global adoption remains possible, persistent uncertainty increases the risk of fragmented regulation, market distortions, and delayed investments; unless strong diplomatic and technical progress bridges the current divides during 2026.

Where does this leave shipping decarbonisation currently

For shipowners, investors, freight users and fuel suppliers, strategy depends on their view of the below factors:

Local regulation

Some policymakers and regions may use the interim period to develop their own standards and incentives for low-carbon shipping. Local efforts like the EU ETS and UK Emissions Trading Scheme are exposed to the risk of carbon leakage. Also to shipowners changing their operations in response to local rules. Policy fragmentation can decrease regulatory certainty and deter investment in the shipping sector and among ports and fuel suppliers.

Customer expectations

With mandatory regulation delayed, industry stakeholders shift shipowners toward voluntary climate action. Financiers and customers may increasingly consider emissions transparency and carbon performance when approving loans or awarding contracts as mandatory climate-related disclosures under the ISSB framework take hold. Scrutiny of supply-chain scope 3 emissions is intensifying, placing mounting pressure on customers to reduce emissions across their logistics and procurement networks. This pressure must cascade to their shipping partners where 80% of world trade moves by sea. This incentivises proactive industry players to accelerate their climate strategies, adopt advanced compliance technologies, and pursue green certification as a way to differentiate their offerings and maintain access to customers and finance. In this way, competitive dynamics favour those who move quickly on decarbonisation, even in the absence of direct IMO regulation.

Transition risk and resilience

Without the adoption of the Framework, there is greater onus on customer expectations and voluntary action as key drivers. Shipowners relying solely on baseline compliance expose themselves to heightened reputational and climate transition risks, especially as supply chains and multinational customers demand lower-carbon transport and the global economy is transitioning toward net zero. Anticipating increased market demands and regulation, partnering with like-minded stakeholders, and embedding climate criteria within business models are measures shipowners can take to become more resilient against those risks. Shipping companies that can demonstrate credible action are better positioned to stay afloat amidst policy uncertainty and supply chain disruption, while laggers may encounter escalating pressure from customers, financiers, and civil society. Failing to address emissions proactively is increasingly precipitating climate litigation across the supply chain, underscoring the strategic imperative for shipping companies to decarbonise.

Conclusion

The IMO’s decarbonisation measures - while uncertain whether they will enter into force - represent a watershed moment for the shipping industry. Regardless of whether the Framework will be adopted, IMO's efforts signal a shift towards a more carbon-conscious future with significant implications for contracts, fleet strategy, and investment. The current regulatory uncertainty is challenging, but it does provide a window for industry stakeholders to prepare, adapt, and influence the final shape of the regulatory and market forces around shipping decarbonisation.

A few days later I came into the office and the mood among the Chrysler engineers had completely changed.
Yes, it would increase shipping rates for those who do not meet the standard, and in the short term probably will increase shipping rates to pay for the cost of new technologies.
However, since maritime shipping rates are such a small fraction of the cost of products, it will hardly be noticeable by the world at large.
Between 1975 and 1985 the CAFE standard doubled fuel efficiency to 27 mpg in cars in the United States.","IMO has kicked the can of sustainability down the road by delaying the Net Zero Framework. It was a strange retreat.

It looked like there would be a useable Framework to reduce emissions, but at the meeting the US fought its implementation tooth and nail and threatened other states if they accepted it. Some countries buckled under and, with the loss of US support, the oil majors saw their chance to jump ship too.

Then ABS expressed doubt about the Framework, and DNV also mumbled about frustrations and then there was a vote to delay implementation of the framework.

It is disturbing that engineers questioned a regulatory technology deadline. Generally, engineers that question a regulatory technology deadline lack the vision to truly apply themselves to the problem or become entangled and confused in politics. Real engineers simply work at fixing the problem, maybe not succeeding in the first pass or the second pass, but hopefully quicker than the next engineer. But trust, whiney engineers are nothing new, I remember encountering half an industry of those as a young engineer in the car industry.

Around 1985 I spent time at Chrysler’s engineering headquarters in Highlands Park. Chrysler had generously offered us the nighttime use of their Cyber 205 supercomputers to perform detailed finite element analyses of America’s Cup 12M structures.

It was fun to be at their engineering headquarters. At that moment the latest Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard would come into force and Chrysler was the only big three automaker whose engineers had met the standard. Meanwhile, Ford and GM engineering leadership had not paid attention and these companies would incur hundreds of millions in penalties until they could redesign their product line to meet the standard.

A few days later I came into the office and the mood among the Chrysler engineers had completely changed. I asked what happened, and was told that Reagan had given Ford and GM a pass on the CAFE standard because it had been too difficult to implement.

This ignored the fact that Chrysler did meet the standards, and I well remember Lee Iacocco’s outrage at this instance of political corruption. Some may argue that Chrysler had benefitted from a government bail-out in 1980, but that had been paid back with a substantial profit to the government by 1983 for which Iacocco famously stated: ""We at Chrysler borrow money the old-fashioned way. We pay it back"".

As a dyed in the wool capitalist, I strongly support governments that set standards and then lets industries compete to meet those standards. Any industrialist that sabotages that approach is not a capitalist, but rather a freeloader or a cheat.

A similar thing is now happening with the IMO rollback, those who worked hard at meeting the looming standards have now spent money and effort for no useful purpose, and those who hoped and pushed for a roll back are now making mint. The Framework is fair. It benefits the capitalists who are willing to invest and innovate and removes those who remain stuck in the old ways. Moreover, the Framework benefits the public at large and, in this case, all over the world.

Inevitably some anti-capitalists argue that it would kill the industry and result in layoffs and increase shipping rates. That is a liar’s argument.

Yes, it would increase shipping rates for those who do not meet the standard, and in the short term probably will increase shipping rates to pay for the cost of new technologies. However, since maritime shipping rates are such a small fraction of the cost of products, it will hardly be noticeable by the world at large. Historically we have had huge sudden shipping rate increases and cargo still continues to move by sea and the public has no clue whether shipping rates are high or low at any one moment.

Inevitably the technological laggards will have to retire their ships and lay off crews, but the industry will not shrink, and the innovators will hire those crews on their improved ships.

It is a simple fact that Government standard setting and forcing capitalist compliance is extremely effective. Reagan pulled the plug on CAFE but it did not go away. Subsequent efforts did further raise the CAFE ratings and increases in national health, air quality, appliance efficiencies, car and food safety were all achieved through different government dictated performance standards.

Between 1975 and 1985 the CAFE standard doubled fuel efficiency to 27 mpg in cars in the United States. Automakers claimed that the public would not like slow, fuel efficient cars and maybe that is true, but today there are dozens of car models that have better gas mileage than 27 mpg and can outperform any pre-1975 hot rod in its slippers, and that does not even consider EV performance and efficiency.

If we would have continued the CAFE standards after 1985, there is no doubt that within a few years there would have been cars that were both high performance and fuel efficient, if the market demanded that.

Similarly, IMO can achieve massive carbon emission reductions with its Framework and politicians should stay away from it, the public should not worry about it, shipowners should shut up, and engineers should get to work.

Implement the Framework, and may the best capitalists working with the best engineers win!

The U.S. seizure of the tanker Skipper marks a shift from tracking dark fleet activity to direct intervention.

Dark fleet vessels rely on AIS manipulation, false flags, and spoofed positions to evade sanctions enforcement.

Fraudulent registries and stateless vessels have become central to illicit oil transport networks.

Enforcement authorities are increasingly treating false-flag tankers as lawful interdiction targets.

Network-level intelligence is now critical to identifying seizure-grade risk before interdiction occurs.

From Monitoring to Intervention

The dark fleet – tankers engaging in dark activities while moving sanctioned oil, cycling through false flags, and obscuring ownership – has continued to expand, reaching more than 1,900 vessels by the end of Q3. Governments had visibility into this activity. What was less consistent was how that intelligence translated into enforcement outcomes.

That changed with the seizure of Skipper.

When U.S. forces boarded and seized the large crude carrier off the coast of Venezuela, it marked a shift in how sanctions enforcement is being applied. The operation did not rely on a military escalation or a declared conflict. It was grounded in documented sanctions violations, false flagging, and the vessel’s lack of legitimate nationality.

For years, dark fleet vessels operated in the space between detection and consequence. The Skipper seizure shows that this space is narrowing. Vessels that rely on spoofing, false registries, and legal ambiguity are now facing direct intervention, not just continued monitoring.

What the Skipper Seizure Reveals About the Modern Dark Fleet

Skipper was not an outlier. It represented the dominant operating model of today’s dark fleet.

Sanctioned in 2022 for its role in an oil-smuggling network tied to Iran and Hezbollah, the vessel continued operating by exploiting systemic weaknesses. It broadcast AIS data that later proved inconsistent with its true movements.

At the time of the boarding, Skipper’s AIS placed the tanker more than 500 nautical miles away, off the coast of Guyana. Windward’s Remote Sensing Intelligence showed otherwise. Satellite-based detections confirmed the vessel was nowhere near its declared position and had been conducting GNSS manipulation since October 28, broadcasting false coordinates while covertly loading sanctioned crude at Venezuela’s José terminal.

Its position reappeared more than 360 nautical miles from its last spoofed signal. It sailed under the flag of Guyana, a registry that has not existed since 2021, rendering the vessel effectively stateless.

This combination – sanctions exposure, AIS manipulation, and false flagging – is now common. Roughly 400 tankers are currently broadcasting affiliation with fraudulent registries listed by the International Maritime Organization, with nearly 300 already sanctioned. Together, they form part of a broader dark fleet of around 1,000 tankers transporting sanctioned oil for Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.

What distinguishes Skipper is not its behavior, but the response it triggered.

What Has Changed in Enforcement Posture

The seizure of Skipper reflects a more direct application of existing sanctions authorities rather than a new legal framework.

The day after the seizure, the United States sanctioned six shipowners whose VLCCs had been transporting Venezuelan crude. According to the U.S. Treasury, four of those vessels manipulated AIS to conceal port calls and vessel movements. These practices were already well documented. What changed was how that information was acted upon.

In Skipper’s case, the vessel was sanctioned, falsely flagged, and effectively stateless. Those conditions removed many of the protections that dark fleet operators have historically relied on to continue trading despite enforcement pressure. The seizure did not require a military escalation or a new sanctions regime. It relied on existing legal authorities applied decisively.

This signals a narrower but more consequential shift: when sanctions violations, AIS manipulation, and false flagging converge, enforcement may no longer stop at designation alone. Physical intervention has become a viable outcome under specific, documentable conditions.

What Governments Should Expect Next

As enforcement accelerates, pressure will shift upstream.

Interdictions will increasingly rely on early detection rather than last-minute response. Authorities will need to identify which vessels are moving toward seizure-grade risk before they enter contested waters or complete cargo transfers. That requires more than static sanctions lists or AIS tracks viewed in isolation.

Dark fleet operations are networked. Vessels share ownership structures, registries, operational patterns, and deceptive behaviors across regions. AIS manipulation rarely occurs alone. It coincides with false documentation, implausible routing histories, and coordinated loitering patterns that only become visible when viewed as part of a wider system.

Governments that surface these connections early will be positioned to act decisively. Others will remain reactive.",https://windward.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Social-image-Border-security-Intelligence-1-3.png,N,,2025-12-16 09:58:28.196505

Also, the strategic signifigance of the shipping sector as a whole is gaining more importance. The cruise shipping industry is most significant in Finnvera's export credit guarantee exposure. Therefore, monitoring and measuring emissions related to ship finance are also an essential part of Finnvera's climate monitoring. Finnvera calculated the emissions of the ship finance portfolio for the fifth time according to the Poseidon Principles.

The calculation is based on the previous year’s data, thus the CO2 level being reported now has been calculated based on the year 2024.

“In relation to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy targets, we are closer to the trajectories than last year. The trajectories strongly challenge Finnvera as our ship finance portfolio consists of the world’s largest and most advanced cruise ships and as approximately two thirds of our portfolio covered by the Poseidon Principles are liquified-natural-gas-powered vessels”, says Executive Vice President Jussi Haarasilta.

The impact of the calculation method is most evident in regard to default emission factors of liquified natural gas.

An ambitious target to cut emissions

The original Poseidon Principles iniative is consistent with the policies and ambitions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to reduce shipping’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% of 2008 levels by 2050. Aligned with this target Finnvera’s score exceeded the trajectory by 30.7% (2024: 37.4%). In relation to the IMO Revised GHG Strategy target Finnvera’s score exceeded the trajectory by 38.6% (44.1%).

Finnvera finances new, technologically advanced vessels. As the calculation is based on the CO2 emissions in relation to the size of the vessel, the distance travelled, as well as the amount of credit related to the vessel, these factors affect the emissions score and annual volatility

Finnvera has developed its climate targets and reporting

The calculation has improved the quality of the data as a source for assessment, based on which we are also able to specify our reporting on climate impacts. For its operations Finnvera has set a climate target in line with the Paris Climate Agreement’s 1.5. degree target. In November 2024, Finnvera joined the Net-Zero ECA Alliance, a UN initiative, whose goals include creating a measurement method for setting, reporting and monitoring emissions targets and building a common vision for the net-zero goal in export financing.

”In our business activities we emphasize active dialogue with the cruise shipping industry widely from the engine technology developers to shipyards and shipping companies. Ships are ordered far into the future, and technology solutions have to be made at an early stage. The solutions therefore have far-reaching effects. We have good opportunities to influence the development of climate solutions, as we essentially finance new technology aiming to build more environmentally efficient ships. Finnvera is continuing to work on developing climate targets and measures according to the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance guidelines.”

This is how the CO2 level is calculated according to Poseidon Principles

Poseidon Principles measures carbon intensity. The data based on which the overall climate alignment score is calculated is distance travelled, amount of fuel consumption for each fuel type, and size of the vessel. The outstanding debt per vessel also play a role when calculating the weighted average of the scores. The calculation is based on a formula that takes into account the distance traveled by the vessels during the year.

The Poseidon Principles members are leading ship financiers, such as international banks, but there are export credit agencies among them. The Poseidon Principles comprises of 36 signatories from 14 different countries, representing almost three-quarters of the global ship finance portfolio. The signatories are leading ship financiers, such as international banks, but there are export credit agencies. Finnvera became signatory in April 2021.

MENA Aims to Boost IMO Liability, Compensation Rules

Maritime stakeholders from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Yemen completed a regional workshop in Alexandria, Egypt (7-11 December) to strengthen their capacity to enforce the IMO liability and compensation regime.

The IMO liability and compensation regime ensures that victims of maritime incidents receive prompt and adequate compensation, while establishing clear, uniform and limited liability rules for shipowners to ensure a level playing field for safe and clean shipping in the region.

The Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt, in cooperation with IMO hosted the workshop, bringing together representatives of maritime administrations and legal experts in the Middle East and North Africa region to enhance their understanding and improve application of key international conventions governing maritime liability and compensation, including:

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 CLC);

the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 Fund Convention);

the Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (2010 HNS Convention);

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (2001 Bunkers Convention);

the Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (2007 Nairobi WRC); and

the International Convention on Salvage (1989 Salvage Convention).

Opening the workshop, Head of Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt Rear Admiral Hussein Mustafa El Geziry, encouraged all participating Member States to accede to and fully implement all IMO treaties related to the liability and compensation regime. This would help ensure that costs arising from maritime incidents are properly covered and also enhance sustainable shipping, noting recent incidents where ships lacked the relevant insurance coverage.

Presentations were delivered by a team from the IMO Legal and External Relations Division, the IOPC Funds Secretariat, and the P & I Clubs, alongside contributions from national representatives highlighting their domestic law-making and implementation processes. These exchanges highlighted national experiences and challenges in aligning with the relevant IMO treaties.

The workshop is expected to contribute to the ratification, implementation and enforcement of the IMO's liability and compensation instruments across all participating Member States.

Odfjell has established an offtake of B24 sustainable biofuel in Rio Grande to secure long-term fuel availability. The Ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.

A practical path to zero-emission shipping—starting now

“We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,” says CEO Harald Fotland. “Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.”

Fotland emphasizes that this is not a one-off demonstration but a long-term commitment.

“With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonization strategy. We activate the entire value chain to find ways to decarbonize our operations, and we are encouraged that key stakeholders are joining us in this groundbreaking initiative.”

Industry-led action for scalable infrastructure

Norway-headquartered Odfjell has taken independent action—self-funding the project and moving ahead without subsidies.

“By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation. It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start. Its success depends on collaboration across the value chain, and we are committed to developing it further together with relevant stakeholders,” Fotland says.

This includes collaboration with ports to increase efficiency, with customers to maximize capacity utilization, and with fuel providers to increase the influx of green fuels.

In Brazil, the currently available sustainable biofuel quality is the so-called certified B24 – a blend of 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% VLSFO.

Introducing biofuel marks another step in Odfjell’s decade-long work to reduce emissions. The company has already improved its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to the 2008 benchmark, achieved through a wide range of technical and operational measures.

The initiative aligns with IMO’s 2030 targets and the EU’s Fit for 55 ambitions, and builds on the 2024 Norway-Brazil MoU to establish a green, transatlantic shipping corridor.

“We hope to inspire broader industry action and welcome continued collaboration with regulators, ports, producers, other ship operators, and customers to accelerate the transition to low-emission maritime transport,” Fotland ends.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/bow-leopard-odfjell-tankers_copy.png,N,,2025-12-16 03:56:30.862400

U.S. Gulf Coast Methanol Bunkering Push Could Be A Game Changer For Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (TSE:9101)

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

December 15, 2025

In December 2025, American Bureau of Shipping, ENEOS, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha and SEACOR Holdings began a joint study to develop a low‑carbon methanol bunkering and supply chain network along the U.S. Gulf Coast, targeting the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operations in the country.

The collaboration positions NYK Line to apply its LNG bunkering experience to emerging methanol fuel infrastructure, aligning its shipping operations with the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal.

We’ll now examine how NYK Line’s move into U.S. Gulf Coast methanol bunkering could influence its investment narrative and future positioning.

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Investment Narrative Recap

To own NYK Line, you generally need to believe it can convert its scale in global shipping into sustainable earnings while managing cyclical freight markets and capital intensive decarbonization. The methanol bunkering study on the U.S. Gulf Coast supports NYK’s energy transition credentials, but the immediate focus for many shareholders is likely still on how the company manages its recently lowered earnings and dividend guidance, which remain the more material short term catalyst and risk.

In that context, the November 2025 update cutting the end year ordinary dividend forecast to JPY 85.00 per share, alongside reduced profit guidance for the year ending March 31, 2026, is highly relevant. It highlights management’s willingness to reset payouts when earnings soften, even after committing to a higher long term dividend policy, and frames decarbonization moves like methanol bunkering as part of a broader question about how reliably future cash flows will support shareholder returns.

Yet behind NYK Line’s energy transition initiatives, investors also need to be aware of how dividend cuts could signal...

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha's narrative projects ¥2409.5 billion revenue and ¥218.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires revenue to decline by 1.7% per year and an earnings decrease of ¥201.2 billion from ¥419.6 billion today.

, a 5% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Two fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span a wide band from ¥2,583.85 to ¥5,248.18, underscoring sharply different views on NYK Line. When you set those against the recent earnings and dividend downgrades, it reinforces how important it is to weigh several perspectives on the company’s ability to sustain profits through the energy transition.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 5% more than the current price!

,Original Search,2025-12-15 12:17:56+00:00,The Engineer,Ricardo To Lead Transatlantic Green Shipping Study - The Engineer,"The Engineer, www.theengineer.co.uk, the-engineer",,,,,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/ricardo-to-lead-transatlantic-green-shipping-study,"The project will also examine how policy can help bridge some of the cost gaps and accelerate deployment of green shipping technology.
Ricardo will lead the study in partnership with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group.
“Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions.
But according to Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, green shipping represents a significant economic opportunity.
“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.","The EU-funded feasibility study will focus on transatlantic traffic between Panama – a global hub for shipping – and Algeciras in Spain, located by the Strait of Gibraltar and one of Europe’s busiest container ports. Both locations are also key bunkering ports, making them strong candidates to play a role in shipping’s decarbonisation journey.

According to Ricardo, the study will investigate the technical, financial and policy conditions required to enable zero or low emissions trade across the route. This includes feasible fuel options, the cost of alternative fuel vessels versus existing ships, as well as compliance costs associated with regulations such as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, FuelEU Maritime, and the EU ETS. The project will also examine how policy can help bridge some of the cost gaps and accelerate deployment of green shipping technology.

Ricardo will lead the study in partnership with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group.

“The Panama–Algeciras green shipping corridor is not only significant because of its trans-oceanic distance, but also because it connects two major global bunker hubs with strong potential to become green hubs,” said Alexi Pons, Ricardo’s associate director for Transport Policy.

“Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions. We’re very excited to be working with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority and the EU on this project.”

According to the Global Maritime Forum, over 80 green shipping corridors have now been established worldwide, with China, India, and Brazil leading the way. However, its annual report also noted that just four of these corridors have reached the ‘realisation’ stage, where construction or operation of vessels or infrastructure has taken place.

The report states that many of these projects have been stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels. The IMO Net Zero Framework has been designed to help address these issues, but recent talks to adopt it collapsed under threats from the US, which claims the regulations will cause it economic harm. But according to Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, green shipping represents a significant economic opportunity.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” said Fahnestock.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/oinihw1u/green.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:56:15.663230

Driven by rising global Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) standards and India’s obligations under Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), the shift marks a decisive move towards safer, cleaner and more resilient port operations.

With a vast coastline rich in mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons and marine biodiversity, Indian ports are under increasing pressure from trade expansion and infrastructure development. To address these challenges responsibly, the country has aligned its maritime policies with the International Maritime Organization’s framework and nine UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on renewable power adoption, improved air and water quality, enhanced waste management and expansion of green cover.

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) has outlined this transition through the Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030, a comprehensive blueprint to modernise the sector while embedding sustainability at its core. The strategy identifies clean fuels such as green hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels and LNG as critical to the future of maritime transport, supported by India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission.

Launched to reduce carbon emissions and position India as a global green hydrogen hub, the mission targets annual production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. It is expected to attract investments of ₹8 lakh crore, generate six lakh jobs and cut fossil fuel imports by ₹1 lakh crore. As part of this initiative, Kandla, Paradip and V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) ports have been identified for development as green hydrogen hubs.

The green maritime push is further reinforced by long-term policy roadmaps. Under Maritime India Vision 2030, investments of ₹3–3.5 lakh crore are projected across ports, shipping and inland waterways, supported by a recent ₹69,725 crore package to revitalise shipbuilding. Complementing this is the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, which earmarks nearly ₹80 lakh crore for ports, green shipping, coastal shipping, inland waterways and shipbuilding, with over 300 actionable initiatives aimed at making India a leading maritime nation by its centenary year of independence.

To operationalise sustainability goals, the government has rolled out several green port initiatives. Ports are being encouraged to develop captive solar power through rooftop installations, unused land and floating solar projects on calm waters. Wind energy adoption is being expanded through onshore and offshore projects, including exploration of offshore wind potential near Okha and the southern peninsula, alongside tidal, wave and solar thermal energy pilots.

Flagship programmes such as the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines, National Green Hydrogen Mission and the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) are reshaping port operations. The ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund aims to catalyse investments in green infrastructure, alternative fuels and fleet modernisation. Under the GTTP, conventional harbour tugs will be replaced with greener alternatives, supported by 30 per cent government funding and aligned with the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

The ‘Panch Karma Sankalp’, announced in May 2024, outlines five major actions, including procurement of green tugs by major ports, development of green hydrogen hubs, creation of a single-window portal for cruise facilitation, and transformation of select ports into smart ports. Complementary initiatives such as the Harit Nauka (Green Vessel) guidelines for inland waterways and the Coastal Green Shipping Corridor—starting with the Kandla–Tuticorin route—are further strengthening low-emission maritime transport.

Ports are also focusing on emission reduction through cleaner fuels, shore-to-ship power, electrification of material-handling equipment and LNG bunkering. The government has set a target for 50 per cent of port vehicles to switch to cleaner fuels by 2030. Green belts are being expanded to control air and noise pollution, enhance biodiversity and improve coastal resilience, in line with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s mandate for 33 per cent green coverage.

A major legislative push comes with the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, which replaces the century-old framework with a modern law mandating global green norms and disaster readiness. The reform follows a decade of strong sector growth, with cargo handling at major ports reaching a record 855 million tonnes in FY 2024–25, port capacity rising nearly 87 per cent, and ship turnaround times halving to 48 hours. Indian ports have also gained international recognition, with nine featuring in the World Bank’s Container Port Performance Index.

On the global stage, India is strengthening partnerships and dialogues to advance sustainable maritime growth. Platforms such as Sagarmanthan and the Green & Digital Maritime Corridors Dialogue at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority have brought together global stakeholders to shape the future of green shipping. Bilateral initiatives, including the India–Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor, aim to accelerate low-emission technologies and digital transformation.

India is also enhancing marine pollution control through robust oil-spill response planning, satellite-based monitoring, oil-sensitivity mapping and prioritisation of ecologically sensitive coastal areas.

As India charts its course towards 2047, the maritime sector is emerging as a cornerstone of sustainable development. Through integrated policy reforms, green technologies and global cooperation, the country is positioning itself not only as a growing maritime power but also as a responsible steward of the oceans and a leader in sustainable shipping.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-2.png,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:15.482880

The disruptor-in-chief was the biggest factor shaping global affairs in 2025 and the top spot on our annual ranking of influence was never really in doubt.

His tariffs bludgeoned the multilateral trade system, his derailment of shipping’s net zero strategy has called into question the very future of global regulation for a global industry via the International Maritime Organization. Very few decisions in shipping this year were unaffected by the Trump factor.

No doubt that will be the case for as long as he remains in the White House, but don’t expect 2026 to simply be a rerun of what has just played out over the past 12 months.

Despite everything, most shipping markets did just fine in 2025.

But the disruptive forces that have allowed shipping markets to defy economic gravity thus far are not going to last forever.

Yes, friction is good for shipping, but over time it becomes a cost. While it was the big geopolitical factors shaping our world thus far, there are more homemade problems heading in our direction for next year.

Longer distances have powered shipping markets since 2020, but the forces fuelling those longer distances are changing.

A delivery bulge is nearing, and utilisation is set to slip as the fleet grows 5% against a 1.5% uptick in tonne-mile demand.

Fleet growth is set to outpace distance adjusted demand next year, and we are not going to be able to scrap our way out of this imbalance immediately, or at least not enough to offset the delivery wave.

The outlook for rates is turning tougher.

So yes, shipping thrives on unpredictability, crisis and luck.

But that doesn’t address the big issues shaping the industry’s future. It doesn’t insulate everyone from a downturn that has the potential to be brutal, regardless of how cash-rich owners feel they are right now.

Everything from technology to globalisation itself is changing around the traditional business model and if this year has taught us anything, it is that we should probably expect the unexpected.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/daily-view/ll-dv-monday.png?rev=c969b87b902549448d61fa9e9247af2b,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:20.997767

Poseidon Principles will expand to include more financial institutions—from private equity and hedge funds to capital markets underwriters—with an aim to further increase climate transparency in shipping finance.

15 December 2025, Copenhagen – Ship financiers’ lending portfolios are getting closer to reaching climate alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ambitious decarbonisation trajectories, with average scores against the ‘minimum trajectory’ improving by nearly 8 percentage points.

The news was revealed today in the Sixth Annual Disclosure Report of the Poseidon Principles, the world’s first sector-specific framework for financial institutions to assess and disclose the climate alignment of their shipping portfolios. With 36 signatories across 14 countries, representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s ship finance portfolio, the initiative establishes a benchmark for the industry in line with the IMO’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050.

This year, signatories disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity, up from 93% last year and the second-highest level since reporting began.

Paul Taylor, Vice Chair of the Poseidon Principles and Global Head of Maritime Industries, Societe Generale, said: “Transparency is key. It fosters collaboration between financial institutions and shipowners, and guides capital toward more efficient vessels and cleaner fuels. The results of this year’s report show encouraging, measurable, real-world momentum and progress in action. Signatories are disclosing the vast majority of their portfolios, showing increasing collaboration between financiers and clients, and climate alignment scores have moved closer to the IMO’s decarbonisation pathways. This progress is particularly striking considering the pathways become more stringent year-on-year. In short, the Poseidon Principles continue to demonstrate the power of financial transparency in guiding the shipping industry’s transition.”

The report shows that emissions data is increasingly informing credit decisions and innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans. Operational efficiency, retrofits, and emerging fuel pathways are noted as key drivers of score improvements this year, and the scores were also impacted by evolving methodologies and external factors, including rerouting vessels on longer routes and disruptions in supply chains. The framework positions financial institutions as active partners in the industry’s transition.

2025 Annual Disclosure Report key findings

Increasing transparency: Twenty-nine signatories disclosed 90% or more of their in-scope portfolio, while nine signatories achieved 100% reporting, the highest number of signatories to hit these two respective targets to date. The average disclosure rate across all signatories was 95%.

Improved climate alignment: While the average scores remain misaligned with the IMO’s net-zero pathways, substantial year-on-year improvements were recorded. Against the IMO’s ‘minimum trajectory’, the scores went from just over 19% misaligned last year to just under 12% misaligned this year, representing a nearly 8 percentage point improvement. Against the IMO’s ‘striving trajectory’, scores went from 25% misaligned to just over 18% misaligned.

Meaningful progress in the cargo and passenger segments: The cargo and passenger segments saw improvements from 14% to 6% misaligned, and from 38% to 26% misaligned, respectively. These shifts demonstrate advances in vessel efficiency, increased uptake of low-emission fuels, and the entry of more efficient dual-fuel vessels into the fleet.

It is important to note that the decarbonisation trajectories set by the 2023 IMO’s GHG Strategy get more challenging to reach each year, making it more difficult to achieve alignment as time goes on. Seeing improvements year-on-year is promising, but additional efforts are still needed to reach milestones in 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Reinforcing the initiative as an established, globally recognised standard for shipping finance, the Poseidon Principles methodology has been included as an acceptable method to set near-term and long-term portfolio alignment targets as part of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Financial Institutions Net-Zero Standard.

Associate membership expansion

Since 2019, the Poseidon Principles have matured into a globally recognised benchmark for transparent, industry-wide climate reporting that has been replicated by other critical sectors, such as steel, aluminium, and aviation. Now, there is a willingness to go further in bringing other institutions on board.

In addition to the lenders, lessors, and financial guarantors historically represented in the signatory list, the Poseidon Principles are now expanding to offer associate membership to a broader range of financial institutions, including private equity, hedge funds, and capital markets underwriters. This expansion will increase the initiative’s potential impact by engaging the wider financial community in the framework without initial reporting obligations. This expansion will strengthen the Association’s influence across the full maritime finance ecosystem and support a broader, more consistent approach to emissions accountability.

Michael Parker, Poseidon Principles Chair and Chairman of Global Shipping & Logistics, Citi, said: “The Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report has become a vital pulse check for the industry, showing how global lending portfolios measure up against the climate ambitions set by the IMO. This consistent transparency gives us a clear view of progress across approximately three-quarters of global ship finance. Without it, we would have no meaningful way to understand how far we and the industry have come, or how far we still need to go. ""Today, the Poseidon Principles are taking another important step to deepen that transparency. By opening Associate Membership to any institution providing or arranging capital for the maritime sector—including private equity firms and hedge funds—we are broadening the lens through which climate considerations can be directly integrated into financing decisions. This expansion supports a broader commitment to transparency and accountability across finance and reinforces the sector’s contribution to a more sustainable future for shipping.”

The latest report cements the critical nature of finance in supporting the shipping industry’s shift toward a zero-emission future while emphasising the crucial role transparency plays in measuring climate alignment.

The V.O. Chidambaranar (VoC) Port is set to roll out a Green Hydrogen Pilot Project aimed at establishing a bunkering facility for green hydrogen and its derivatives. The initiative seeks to support the gradual adoption of green fuels in the shipping sector by providing refuelling infrastructure for vessels operating on both domestic and international routes.

According to a written reply in the Lok Sabha by the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the project is expected to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions while generating direct and indirect employment opportunities in the manufacturing, storage, and ancillary services associated with green fuels.

This pilot marks a strategic step toward decarbonizing India’s maritime transport and promoting sustainable fuel alternatives in the country’s shipping industry.

It equips us to address sectoral challenges more effectively and positions the industry to attain the targets set by Mr. President for a modern, efficient, and globally competitive maritime sector.
The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.
At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.
Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics.","In this interview, Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC), Dr Pius Akutah, reflects on the Council’s most significant milestones, outlines expectations for the next phase under the current administration, and highlights how ongoing reforms from port regulation to inland logistics and dispute resolution are laying the foundation for a more efficient and globally competitive maritime economy. PAUL OGBUOKIRI reports.

Looking back at your two years as Executive Secretary, what would you identify as the most significant achievement of the Council on your watch?

Two years have indeed come and gone, and within that period, a great deal has happened in the Council. As you requested, I will highlight the most significant achievement we have recorded, and it is the passing of the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Agency Bill. At the moment, it is undergoing final refinements by the National Assembly after being vetted by the Office of the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation.

Once this stage is completed, it will proceed to the President for assent. This development is particularly important because the Council has long operated under a 1978 Decree, now codified as CAP N133 LFN 2004. The Nigerian Shippers’ Council Act is an outdated law that no longer reflects the realities or reform direction of the maritime sector under the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

For us as a Council, this new legal framework is crucial. It equips us to address sectoral challenges more effectively and positions the industry to attain the targets set by Mr. President for a modern, efficient, and globally competitive maritime sector.

Can you give us an idea of what you expect in the second half of your tenure which you have stepped into now?

First of all, I must congratulate Mr. President for the leadership he is providing in driving the economic rebirth of this country. For many years, we have spoken about diversifying Nigeria’s economy, but for the first time, we are now witnessing true diversification in both real time and in practical terms.

The Maritime and Blue Economy sector holds immense potential. As we unlock these opportunities, we will generate significant wealth, create jobs, and lift many Nigerians out of poverty. The reality and importance of this sector are now clearly visible to everyone. Fortunately, we have a proactive Minister who is working tirelessly to reposition Nigeria on the global stage as a true maritime nation.

The passage of the Marine and Blue Economy Policy championed by His Excellency Adegboyega Oyetola, shows that the necessary foundations for the sector have been firmly laid. As we move into the second half of this administration’s tenure, the next two years carry great significance for the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy. A lot has already been done to prepare the ground for what is coming next.

I believe that with the structures now in place, we will witness major progress in the next phase. For us as a Council in particular, we are focused on securing assent to our bill. By virtue of a government gazette, NSC to a large extent started performing its role as an economic regulator.

Now, could you give us an overview of your interaction with stakeholders in the sector and how they are cooperating with you in respect of this mandate that you have already undertaken so far? The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.

I must acknowledge that stakeholders have demonstrated a genuine willingness to work collaboratively with us. Everyone recognizes that the sector is facing challenges, and no one is interested in sustaining these problems. Instead, stakeholders are focused on protecting their investments and ensuring profitability. So far, engagements with stakeholders have been smooth.

We have not encountered any major issues, and shippers’ associations across the country have fully cooperated with us. I am pleased to note that we have introduced certain policies, and stakeholders have promptly adjusted to them. This level of responsiveness has contributed to a healthy working relationship as we move forward. We all understand that the more reformed and efficient the sector becomes, the better it is for every player operating within it.

Today, the shipping sector has become one of the most attractive areas of employment, offering a minimum wage of over ₦200,000 a standard negotiated by the Council. While this wage structure has existed for over two decades, it is important to emphasize that achieving and sustaining this milestone would have been impossible without the active support and contributions of stakeholders.

To what extent are the various government agencies in the sector, especially those not in the same ministry with you, are keying into your reforms, and to what extent have you also modernized your operations to be in tandem with global best practices, talking about national single window and port community system?

Most of these interventions and reforms are still ongoing. Within the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy, the traditional agencies that everyone is familiar with have now been fully integrated into the ministry’s policy framework.

As a result, challenges related to collaboration and coordination have significantly reduced, as the ministry now maintains firm oversight and alignment across its agencies. Today, the ministry hosts a wider range of agencies than before, including those moved from other ministries.

However, the maritime ecosystem still intersects with numerous ministries. For example, as a Council, we promote an intermodal transport system, which cannot be achieved without engaging the Ministry of Transportation. Over the years, the Council has signed various Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with agencies located in other ministries.

One such MoU exists with the Nigerian Railway Corporation, designed to ensure a harmonious working relationship and to promote key services within the sector. Specifically, this MoU guides cooperation between the Nigerian Shippers’ Council and the Nigerian Railway Corporation on cost structuring and ensures that shippers are not shortchanged when using the rail system recognizing that rail remains the most efficient and cost effective means of cargo movement across the country.

Similar agreements exist with other agencies across different ministries. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is also a major stakeholder in the country’s maritime structure, and we maintain an excellent and robust working relationship with them. As a Council, our guiding principle has always been to advocate for cooperation with every stakeholder, because collectively we are executing the mandate of Mr. President, as provided under Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution.

Can we have a measurable projection in respect to the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Bill? What are the immediate, medium, and long-term gains that we expect from that bill if signed into law?

In the medium term, we will see a surge in investment as investor confidence increases. Predictability both in regulation and in return on investment is a key factor for investors, especially in a sector as capitalintensive as the port and shipping industry. Investments here require significant financial commitments, and investors must be certain that the regulatory environment will remain stable.

They need assurance that policies and laws will not suddenly shift in ways that could negatively affect their investments. Without this clarity and predictability, no serious investor will commit substantial funds to such a sensitive and high-cost sector. In the long term, Nigeria will begin to fully integrate into the global maritime community.

Our processes would have been streamlined and key systems such as the cargo tracking note, the port community system, and the National Single Window will be fully operational. Together with a solid regulatory framework, these systems will create a modern and efficient maritime environment. At that point, Nigeria will truly stand out as a maritime nation of repute, recognized globally for its efficiency, competitiveness, and regulatory strength.

Can you give us an insight into the Truck Transit Park that has been promoted by the Nigerian Shippers Council, a brief into what the geographical spread is, project completion, and their contribution to the good and growth of the Nigerian economy, particularly the logistics sector?

Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and across the continent from North Africa to West, Central, and Southern Africa you find port infrastructures spread widely. As the most populous nation on the continent, Nigeria remains a country the rest of Africa looks up to, even though they are not waiting for us. Several African nations are already making deliberate efforts to develop their maritime infrastructure, especially in the area of logistics.

Nigeria is not entirely behind, but we are behind to an extent, particularly because Africa expects us to take the lead in developing logistics infrastructure. At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.

Today, we have developed two important maps, one covering the entire African continent. It highlights the distribution of critical maritime infrastructure, especially those linked to logistics. Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics. Connecting African countries remains extremely difficult.

For example, a vessel carrying cargo from Nigeria to Ghana may first go to Europe before returning to Ghana. This is inefficient and time consuming, underscoring the urgent need for proper African connectivity. A key challenge is that most African countries are not ship owning nations.

They lease vessels, and these vessels operate on predetermined routes that cannot easily be altered to create direct African shipping lanes. That is the crux of the problem. Bringing it back home, we examined logistics supporting infrastructure and concluded that, as a Council, we must promote the development of Inland Dry Ports, Transit Parks, Border Facilities, and similar structures.

These will support the movement of Transit Cargo from the hinterlands to the seaports and bring shipping services closer to shippers across the country. Regarding inland dry ports, we have several legacy projects. When Mr. President assumed office, he pushed for the completion of the nearly finished Funtua Inland Dry Port.

Currently, the operational dry ports are mainly in the north-western region, Kano, Kaduna, and Katsina. Others exist across the country, but their progress has been slow. We are working with state governments to accelerate their completion.

In Borno State, for instance, a privately developed inland dry port has been established. We are now engaging stakeholders to fast-track its completion so that it can be commissioned during the second half of the President’s tenure.

The Governor of Borno State is particularly committed to achieving this. For Vehicle Transit Parks, one of the major issues you raised, we observed that many road accidents are caused by driver fatigue. Drivers travel long hours without rest, leading to fatal accidents.

To address this, we began promoting the establishment of Vehicle Transit Parks. These parks are not only rest stops; they will also serve as economic hubs where drivers can relax, refresh, and secure their cargo. Rather than parking in unsafe roadside areas where goods can be stolen or damaged, drivers will have safe, secure, and well equipped facilities.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-14-090000.png,N,,2025-12-14 23:56:20.544710

The four parties aim to establish the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship*2 methanol bunkering operations in the U.S. In the global maritime industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and practical solutions are increasingly required. Low-carbon methanol produced from renewable or bio-based sources is gaining attention as a next-generation marine fuel due to its easy handling as a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, as well as its potential to reduce GHG emissions.

ENEOS will explore the procurement and supply of low-carbon methanol, including green methanol to be produced by C2X, a company in which ENEOS holds an equity stake, through the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana*3.

NYK Line will leverage its experience in developing LNG bunkering infrastructure and provide technical expertise for preparing methanol bunkering vessels.

SEACOR will contribute its expertise as a long-term Jones Act qualified owner and operator of diversified assets across the U.S. coastwise and inland waterways, in addition to its design, engineering and construction capabilities.

These risks include potential tariff-related escalation; other protectionism-driven tensions such as port fees; the possible resumption of Red Sea transits; a potential conflict in Venezuela; and increasing competition for control of shipping value chains.

We expect container-shipping performance to weaken in 2026, according to Global Shipping Outlook 2026, as lower freight rates resulting from a weakened supply-demand balance will lead to lower profits, alongside the risk to freight rates from a potential resumption of Red Sea transits. We expect regional variations, with container trade to North America remaining particularly weak compared with other regions.

The container order book, at about 30% of the existing fleet, is at its highest level in more than 10 years. This reflects continuing new orders to replace ageing fleets and to upgrade vessels to multi‑fuel capability to meet emissions‑reduction targets, as well as capacity growth. As a result, we expect supply to exceed demand; however, we also expect partial mitigation through increased fleet idling (from about 1% currently), blank sailings, scrapping and slow steaming.

Tankers should continue to perform well, particularly crude tankers, due to growth in end demand and tonne-miles. Seaborne oil trade grew in 2025 due to higher production by OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers, leading to about a 3% supply increase, with the same expected in 2026. The rise in tonne-miles related to oil exports from Russia, and Red Sea disruption has kept overall demand for tankers high.

We expect weak performance in the dry-bulk segment but volumes should be stable year on year. Order books remain healthy, at close to 11% and 16% of the existing fleet for dry bulk and tankers, respectively, which are needed to replace the ageing fleets. Further significant growth is limited by the shortage of yard slots for new orders over the next three years.

We expect performance across other segments, such as liquefied natural gas shipping and car carriers, to remain broadly stable.

A further increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for certain high-margin or critical products in the medium term. Some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs, but we believe protectionism is overall negative for the shipping industry.

Emissions regulations have developed further and there is better visibility over the International Maritime Organisation’s longer-term plan through the Net-Zero framework, although it is yet to be approved. These regulatory developments are likely to put pressure on shipping companies’ margins in the medium term, and the extent of pass-through is not yet known.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Global_Shipping_and_Demand.png,N,,2025-12-12 23:31:04.567637

What do we need from the next ten years to complete the job?

Not enough, but far better

That global emissions are still edging up hides half the story. Emissions are growing far more slowly than in the decade before Paris and China’s emissions have been flat or declining since 2024. Clean energy investment is at record levels and now outpaces fossil fuel investment by roughly two to one after reaching parity six years ago. Electrotech is driving growth in major economies and with renewable energy the cheapest and fastest energy source to deploy, non‑fossil sources already provide over 41% of the global energy mix. In 2015, we all predicted this scale of change would take until the mid‑2030s.

The world economy is shifting, and the political and legal clarity that the Paris Agreement consensus provided is at the root of this transformation. The latest round of national climate plans, the crux of the Paris Agreement architecture, still adds up to a pathway of 2.3-2.5 degrees of warming, but they do represent plans that will see emissions drop by at least 12% on 2019 levels by 2035. Countries just agreed in Belém that they should continue ramping up that ambition and – critically – develop implementation and investment plans to make sure it’s delivered. But the overwhelming message from commentators and analysts in response to the Belem COP30 result was “failure”.

Is there a future in which the shaky ground of multilateral cooperation can get us onto that 1.5C warming limit pathway? And are COPs the “least-worst system”, as the UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband put it, to get there?

Politics in a “down phase”, trajectory still up

Politically, the last decade has been anything but linear. There have been high points – the adoption of the Paris rulebook, the net zero pledging bonanza of COP26, the first mention of fossil fuels in a globally agreed climate decision, the tripling‑renewables and doubling‑efficiency goals, and the launch of loss and damage funding arrangements. There have also been very visible setbacks, including major emitters backtracking, growing climate polarisation and heavily contested COP outcomes. This ebb and flow is one we have become accustomed to.

But the trajectory of climate action has remained upwards. Since 2015, climate framework laws have more than tripled, climate policy instruments have increased roughly seven‑fold and around three‑quarters of global GDP (rising to just over four‑fifths including sub‑national pledges) remains covered by some form of net‑zero target, even after the retreat of the US federal goal.

Our political “down” phase today is complicated by a more difficult and different geopolitical environment. Climate diplomacy now unfolds amid wars, deepening strategic rivalry, reshoring of supply chains, and intensified competition over critical minerals and industrial policy. International cooperation is shifting away from multilateral frameworks towards a more explicitly bilateral and transactional model, centred on packages of energy, infrastructure and security deals. This direction is reflected in ACS2 outcomes, the EU’s revamped Global Gateway strategy (and, in its extreme version, the latest US national security strategy.). While this can leave space for mutual interest, investment and agency for partner countries, it also risks shortening political time horizons, fragmenting standards and weakening incentives to invest in governance and social safeguards.

The future of the COP space

Against this backdrop, frustration with the COP process is understandable. The system is overloaded. The expectations are enormous. And we are still far from where science – and people on the frontline of climate impacts – say we need to be. Fossil fuel subsidies remain pervasive while adaptation and loss –and damage support lag, deepening existing inequalities, with disproportionate burdens on low-income households, marginalised communities and workers in carbon-intensive sectors.

We are right to question whether COPs are the right place to address this crisis. But COPs are not sentient actors that “fail” or “succeed” on their own. They are (precious) political and institutional spaces that deliver only what governments, institutions and societies choose to invest in them – in terms of ambition, negotiating capital and implementation capacity.

Big results like the Paris Agreement demand a huge diplomatic lift and just the right convergence of political conditions, that are clearly not in place now (as the latest IMO talks on shipping emissions showed). Fortunately, we don’t need another Paris Agreement moment. We have a permanent global architecture with five yearly cycles of countries sharing their nationally determined climate plans followed by collective global stocktakes and an ‘Action Agenda’ for driving the action of non-state actors like businesses and city governments.

The climate ambitious are already evolving how they use the COP space, adapting to the new mission for implementation. Recent years have seen coalitions of the willing on issues such as grids, storage and methane effectively compel Presidencies to create room for outcome documents, roadmaps and Presidency‑led initiatives that go beyond the minimum consensus text. The fossil fuel transition roadmap and pledges launched alongside the formal COP30 decisions follow this trend. This model could become a disciplined tool for implementation, if it can transform layers of pledges into actual policy frameworks.

Designing the next phase of climate governance in a new world order

The bigger test is whether these new COP tools can stand up to our evolving geopolitical landscape. This will require addressing the material constraints facing most of the world, above all debt and access to capital. For many emerging and developing economies, climate ambition is constrained not by lack of plans or ambition but by high borrowing costs, limited fiscal space and inadequate volumes of concessional and grant finance. It will also depend on finding ways to integrate trade, industrial and climate governance. A fossil fuel transition roadmap, for example, would need to convince states that they will have routes to prosperity outside their fossil fuel extraction models: clearly addressing the risks and providing economic feasible alternatives backed by international financial tools to enable them. A big ask in a geopolitical maelstrom.

Nonetheless, the entry into force of the UN High Seas Treaty in 2025 shows that states can still agree ambitious rules for protecting global commons even in a period of heightened international tension. Currently, major countries from the Global South are openly pushing back against anti-multilateral approaches to climate and energy, arguing instead for an international order based on shared rules rather than bilateral power-plays. Indonesian President Probowo’s UN General Assembly speech rallied a defense of multilateralism in stark contrast to US President Trump’s tirade. At April’s IEA Energy Security Conference, the US’ push to resurrect the fossil economy was met with defiance from energy transition allies. The evolving geopolitical order is not yet doomed to a fortress world.

The biggest strategic question for the next ten years is thus whether climate cooperation can become a structuring element of a new global order, rather than a casualty of its disorder. Can west, east and south define a shared floor of responsibility and support, even as they compete on technology and industrial capacity?",https://eccoclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54908710444_2ba9a0ed18_c.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:56:42.191315

Request for an international livestock carrier code The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock.","On 5 December, a coalition of animal welfare organizations issued a letter to the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), asking for an improved regulatory framework on livestock carriers.

The signatories call for urgent action to address safety, welfare and environmental risks linked to the global livestock carrier fleet. They note that vessels in this sector average 40 years of age, far beyond typical safe operating life. Many ships are conversions of older vessels, vulnerable to corrosion from constant exposure to effluent, and linked to a long record of casualties involving both seafarers and animals.

Recent tragedies, including losses such as Gulf Livestock 1, Haidar and Queen Hind, are cited in the letter as evidence of systemic failings.

Concerns over weak oversight and regulatory gaps

The letter highlights recurring problems with ships operating under black and grey-listed flags, often associated with poor enforcement of MARPOL requirements, substandard safety equipment and inadequate working conditions.

Since existing IMO conventions do not address livestock-specific risks, issues such as ventilation, waste and carcass management, structural integrity and animal welfare remain largely unregulated.

The signatories report that untreated waste and dead animals are routinely discharged at sea, creating environmental and public health risks in Special Areas including the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

Animal welfare and crew wellbeing issues

According to the organisations, the absence of targeted regulation results in predictable animal welfare problems. These include heat stress, overcrowding, disease and prolonged exposure to waste during voyages lasting several weeks.

Crew members face heightened risks from unsafe working environments, close interactions with large animals, exposure to pathogens and the collapse of corroded decks.

Insurers and the International Transport Workers’ Federation report chronic financial instability across the sector, along with a disproportionate number of abandoned crews and high rates of port detentions.

Shift toward alternatives and call for action

The signatories point out that several exporting countries, including New Zealand, India, Australia and the United Kingdom, have adopted or announced bans or phaseouts of live animal exports.

These developments reflect increasing recognition of the risks associated with the trade. Despite this, about 110 livestock carriers remain active, many nearing the end of their usable lifespan, raising concerns about future incidents without coordinated international intervention.

Request for an international livestock carrier code

The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock. The signatories note that other high-risk cargo sectors are governed by specialized IMO codes. By contrast, the transport of millions of live animals each year is covered only by general shipping provisions that were not designed for this purpose.

As noted by the organizations, a dedicated code is necessary to protect seafarers, safeguard the marine environment and improve the welfare of animals transported by sea.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2446795825-e1765532543863.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:10:08.049157

“One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.
Bottom line The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea.","Wind propulsion is moving from novelty to considered climate solution, but its wider adoption hinges on clearer rules, trusted performance data, and joined-up commercial models, industry leaders told a MarRI-UK webinar on “Wind Propulsion Technology & the Maritime Market.”

Hosted by MarRI-UK and chaired by John Hudson, the session brought together Diane (Di) Gilpin, founder and CEO of Smart Green Shipping (SGS), Frank Hendrikse, Manager, Tanker department, Norway, Hagland Shipbrokers, and Camille Bourgeon of the IMO’s environment division. The conversation ranged from the practical, crew reaction and retrofit challenges, to regulatory and financing obstacles, and returned repeatedly to the need for robust, standardized performance measurement.

Regulatory uncertainty and the NZF pause

Speakers agreed that the recent delay to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) have added uncertainty that complicates investment decisions across the sector.

The extraordinary session of the marine environment protection committee was adjourned for a period of one year in October. Work continues in the meantime, but the market has uncertainty

… Bourgeon stressed, but acknowledged the impact of the adjournment.

Panelists warned that fragmented regional rules could damage the global market unless a global IMO framework resumes. Frank Hendrikse argued that worldwide regulation remains “critically important for an international industry” and urged a return to global consensus so that owners and financiers can plan with confidence.

The MEPC outcome is unfortunate, and the worst-case scenario is that regional markets and countries start having their own rules and restrictions. World shipping is a global business, so IMO regulations are very important. We sincerely hope this is only a short delay and that we can continue our work.

… said Frank Hendrikse.

Where wind fits in the metrics debate

One focal point was how wind propulsion should be treated within the IMO’s emerging greenhouse gas metrics, especially the Global Fuel Indicator (GFI) being developed under the NZF.

Bourgeon said the GFI workstream is “the right vehicle” to accommodate wind technologies, but that technical discussions are still needed to ensure the metric is technology-neutral and properly reflects wind’s contribution.

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box. “Wind is an energy source in its own right,” she said, noting that classifying it only as efficiency can reduce investor appetite.

If you talk about energy efficiency, there’s a lower level of appetite. If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors

… Di Gilpin noted.

Panelists also encouraged technical work on life-cycle assessment (LCA) and urged industry stakeholders to engage in the ongoing GFI and LCA guideline development so wind solutions are measured consistently and credibly.

Data, validation and the trust barrier

A recurring theme was the need for independent, standardized validation to counter past over-claiming about fuel savings. “One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.

Di Gilpin described SGS’s approach: developing digital twins and using ITTC-aligned sea trials to validate predictive models. “We can guarantee fuel-saving performance through our prediction tools,” she said, adding that validated models make it possible to underwrite leases and performance guarantees, a commercial arrangement SGS favors because it transfers lifetime risk away from shipowners.

Bourgeon noted IMO work to improve measurement guidance and called for more “exchange of experience” and willingness to share granular performance data so regulators, owners, and charterers can build confidence.

Segments, retrofits and crew acceptance

Speakers said wind technologies are being trialed across many sectors, but that uptake varies by segment and vessel design. Hendrikse suggested tankers and smaller dry cargo ships, where deck space and cargo operations are more flexible, may be early candidates, while large containerships pose tougher packaging challenges. “Container ships are more challenging,” he said, though feeder vessels and kites have been trialed.

The panel also contrasted retrofit versus newbuild approaches. Retrofitting is constrained by existing ship geometries and stability limits, Hendrikse observed, whereas newbuild designs can optimize hull form, superstructure, and engine sizing around sails or rotors, potentially lowering the incremental cost of wind systems.

On human factors, the webinar found skepticism often gives way to enthusiasm once crews see the systems in action. Gilpin recounted trials aboard a chartered ship, the Pacific Gribb, where initial reluctance turned to engagement within an hour of raising a wing.

Speakers recommended integrating wind-system scenarios into bridge simulators and flagging the forthcoming STCW training review as an opportunity to fold wind-propulsion competence into seafarer standards.

Financing, business models and standardization

Panelists stressed that policy and finance levers can accelerate adoption. Participants pointed to several enablers: a clear, internationally harmonized regulatory framework, standardized performance metrics (an IMO priority), and financing structures that align costs and benefits across owners, charterers, and cargo buyers.

Gilpin and Hendrikse both emphasized the importance of champions, offtakers, or investors willing to underwrite early projects, and practical contracting solutions that allocate risk and reward. Di described SGS’s leasing model, which keeps lifetime and maintenance risk off owners’ balance sheets, helping bridge the gap between early prototypes and commercial maturity.

Bourgeon highlighted IMO’s ongoing work on performance standardization for wind propulsion technologies and encouraged stakeholders to engage in technical discussions to ensure new tools and metrics reflect operational realities.

Bottom line

The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea. A growing pipeline of pilots, validated modeling tools, and engaged cargo owners is shifting wind into the realistic innovation category.

But panelists were clear that progress requires aligned metrics, transparent validation, and financing mechanisms that share risk across the value chain.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important.
Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction.
This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements.
Conclusion Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time.","THE recent failure to secure agreement on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has created renewed uncertainty for shipowners at a moment when long-term clarity is needed. A global path was expected to guide investment decisions and support consistent planning. Without it, there is a heightened risk that shipowners may face rising costs as they attempt to comply with a complicated and still developing mix of national and regional measures.

In the absence of a unified approach, regions are pressing ahead with their own initiatives, each designed to address emissions in ways that reflect local priorities. Europe is already far advanced with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, while regulatory ideas are gaining momentum in Asia and Africa.

Although these initiatives share the intention of reducing emissions, they differ in scope, data requirements and cost structures. Shipowners trading across multiple areas must therefore prepare for obligations that may vary depending on where their vessels operate.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important. The introduction of European measures highlighted how easily unplanned exposure can arise. Operators that call at European ports for only part of the year found that even short visits carried consequences they had not anticipated. With other regions exploring their own approaches, the challenge of forecasting how operational patterns influence compliance costs is becoming a central concern for owners.

Alongside regulatory questions, owners must assess which technological paths offer practical progress. LNG continues to be the preferred option for many newbuildings due to its maturity and established infrastructure. Methanol is attracting attention for retrofits, offering a more straightforward transition from traditional liquid fuels. Ammonia is also being explored, particularly for merchant vessels, although handling and safety considerations remain significant factors.

Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction. Improvements in hydrodynamic design, propulsion systems and energy utilisation are already delivering measurable gains. Waste heat recovery, once mainly associated with newbuildings, is now being applied more widely to existing vessels. Battery systems and shore power connections are also becoming more common, providing options for reducing consumption without depending on future fuel availability.

A stronger partnership offering shipowners more than the sum of its parts

The passenger and cruise sectors have been early adopters of many energy efficiency and retrofit solutions. These ships present unique engineering challenges because of their dense machinery layouts and significant hotel loads. Foreship’s extensive experience in this segment, developed through thousands of projects, has produced practical insights that are increasingly valuable across the wider maritime industry. Lessons learnt from integrating new systems into constrained spaces and maintaining operational continuity translate directly to other vessel types.

RINA’s acquisition of Foreship has brought together deep expertise in the passenger and cruise sectors with comprehensive capabilities. This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements. As regulation continues to evolve, the combined organisation offers shipowners practical engineering insight helping them assess their options with greater confidence at a time when environmental rules are shifting and compliance pathways are still taking shape.

Conclusion

Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time. Until then, owners must navigate a landscape that is still forming, shaped by regional initiatives and advancing technologies. Realistic, integrated guidance will be essential. By drawing on the combined strengths of RINA and Foreship, shipowners gain a more reliable foundation to manage uncertainty and prepare their fleets for a lower-carbon future.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/sponsored-content/2025-rina/marine-1-download-copy.png?rev=92c5eb6129574a54b616e9ee7d744ba5,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:14.880885

American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”), ENEOS Corporation (“ENEOS”), Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (“NYK Line”), and SEACOR Holdings Inc. (“SEACOR”) have begun a joint study to develop a methanol bunkering*1 and supply chain network along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The four parties aim to establish the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship*2 methanol bunkering operations in the U.S. In the global maritime industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and practical solutions are increasingly required. Low-carbon methanol produced from renewable or bio-based sources is gaining attention as a next-generation marine fuel due to its easy handling as a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, as well as its potential to reduce GHG emissions.

ENEOS will explore the procurement and supply of low-carbon methanol, including green methanol to be produced by C2X, a company in which ENEOS holds an equity stake, through the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana*3.

NYK Line will leverage its experience in developing LNG bunkering infrastructure and provide technical expertise for preparing methanol bunkering vessels.

SEACOR will contribute its expertise as a long-term Jones Act qualified owner and operator of diversified assets across the U.S. coastwise and inland waterways, in addition to its design, engineering and construction capabilities.

ABS will provide class and regulatory support needed to establish methanol bunkering operations in the U.S.

Through this initiative, ABS, ENEOS, NYK Line and SEACOR aim to help realize a carbon-neutral future for the maritime industry.

The shipments range from 17 antelopes, a rescued baboon, and 37 tons of art to a helmet that Michael Schumacher signed that same year

Singapore, December 8, 2025 – Parcels, planeloads, and packed shipping containers are what people typically associate with DHL Group, the world’s leading logistics provider. However, this only scratches the surface of what the company delivers throughout the year. Here are just five of the most extraordinary shipments the global market leader in logistics handled in 2025

151 Bear Sculptures on a Journey from Germany to Singapore

When art goes on tour: In June 2025, 151 life-sized bear sculptures embarked on a journey of about 10,000 kilometers from Wustermark near Berlin to Singapore. Crafted from weather-resistant fiberglass, each sculpture stands about two meters tall. Known as the “United Buddy Bears”, this colorful art project was launched in Berlin in 2002 to spread a message of peace and tolerance. Every bear is painted by an artist from a different country, symbolizing that nation’s culture and identity. DHL oversaw the secure transport of these valuable artworks. Weighing a total of 37 tons, the shipment was packed into eight sea containers, loaded by crane onto trucks, and transported to the Port of Hamburg. From there, the bears began their sea voyage to Singapore, where they were displayed for two months, continuing their mission of promoting international understanding.

USA to Kenya – Rare Antelopes Go Home

13,000 kilometers for survival: In February 2025, DHL transported 17 mountain bongo antelopes from a conservation center in Loxahatchee, Florida, to a wildlife sanctuary on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa’s second-highest peak. These animals are descendants of mountain bongos relocated from Kenya in the 1970s. Today, after decades of poaching, habitat loss, and forest degradation, the species is critically endangered, with fewer than 100 surviving in the wild. To ensure the Florida bongos’ safety and comfort on their journey, DHL provided a dedicated flight equipped with custom-built crates supplied by a wildlife protection organization. The animals received continuous care from a veterinarian and two bongo specialists. Their new sanctuary offers a secure environment where they can breed and thrive. Their offspring will one day return to the wild, reclaiming Mount Kenya’s forests as their natural home.

Across Continents, Signed by Legends – A Far-Traveled Helmet Meets Michael Schumacher

From Switzerland to Brazil, a helmet like no other embarked on a tour across continents in March 2025. On its journey, the helmet was signed by all 20 living Formula 1® world champions, becoming a unique piece of motorsport history. One signature was particularly moving: Michael Schumacher’s, the seven-time world champion who has withdrawn from public life since his severe skiing accident in 2013. His wife, Corinna, helped guide his hand to write his initials, “M.S.”, on the helmet – a gesture that resonated deeply with fans around the world. A replica of the helmet was later featured as a raffle prize to help fund the “Race Against Dementia” charity. Founded by three-time Formula 1® champion Sir Jackie Stewart, the organization funds research into prevention and treatments for dementia – a cause close to his heart after his wife’s diagnosis. Under strict security measures, DHL transported the helmet from Switzerland to the homes of multiple champions so they could add their signatures. The route included stops in Ibiza in Spain, London in the UK, and Brasília in Brazil.

Saving Saadoon – A Young Baboon Moves from the Middle East to East Africa

An unusual passenger boarded a DHL flight from Bahrain to Djibouti, East Africa, in November 2025 – Saadoon, a young male baboon. He was found abandoned and in critical condition in Bahrain in 2024, at just three months old, in a country where baboons are not native. Saadoon was a victim of illegal wildlife trade. After more than a year of intensive care by an animal welfare organization, he needed an environment suited to his species. Djibouti’s climate and ecosystem offered exactly that. DHL flew Saadoon from Muharraq in Bahrain to Djibouti airport, where he was transferred to a specialized refuge near Djibouti City. Custom boxes, veterinary oversight, and an accompanying animal welfare representative minimized stress during the flight. Now living in a sanctuary tailored to his needs, Saadoon shares a new home with a female baboon, essential for social bonding among these intelligent primates. His new surroundings give him a chance to adapt and, hopefully, live freely one day.

Paraguay to Peru – South America’s Iconic Club Football Trophy on the Move

In November 2025, DHL delivered the iconic trophy for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Final, South America’s most prestigious club football showdown. The journey began at CONMEBOL’s headquarters in Luque, Paraguay, and ended in Lima, Peru, where the decisive match took place on November 29. Standing alongside Europe’s UEFA Champions League, the CONMEBOL Libertadores brings together the best clubs from across South America, each chasing the ultimate prize and the privilege to represent the continent at the FIFA Club World Cup. Known for its electrifying atmosphere and passionate fans, the final is a sports highlight watched by millions worldwide. As CONMEBOL’s Official Logistics Partner, DHL ensured the trophy’s safe and timely arrival. Roughly one meter in height, it traveled in a custom metallic case with a special security lock and was handled exclusively with gloves to preserve its flawless shine. Even sealed inside the case, the trophy sparked excitement – fans who spotted it often gathered to snap photos and share the moment. This year, Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro claimed the trophy after an unforgettable all-Brazilian clash against Palmeiras of São Paulo.

Fortescue plans to retrofit all of its own ships with ammonia engines by 2030 and any newbuilds will feature ammonia engines.","The December issue of Maritime Reporter magazine includes a feature story on Australian mining company Fortescue’s pioneering ammonia fuel trial on the platform supply vessel Green Pioneer.

The Green Pioneer was named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025.

The conversion journey of its diesel-electric power system to dual-fuel ammonia started in 2022, on land, when Fortescue converted a four-stroke Cummins engine at is Perth testing facility in Western Australia.

“The Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that safe, technical solutions for ammonia power engines exist” said Dr. Andrew Forrest, the Chairman of Fortescue back in 2024, and he has continued to push for “real zero” fossil-free operations on land and at sea.

Fortescue Shipping owns a fleet of eight conventionally powered Singapore-flagged very large ore carries as well as the Green Pioneer. Fortescue plans to retrofit all of its own ships with ammonia engines by 2030 and any newbuilds will feature ammonia engines.

Fortescue also charters in ships which contribute to the group’s Scope 3 emissions, the Net Zero target for which is 2040.

Fortescue has also developed a decarbonized mining approach. By 2030, the company’s mines will feature battery electric trucks, excavators and drills, autonomous vehicles, fast battery chargers for mobile mine equipment, and ore processing powered by wind and solar, supported by battery energy storage systems.

The company’s Green Metal project will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology to produce low emissions metal suitable for most global steel plants. Shipping semi-processed metal instead of the ore will also reduce shipping volumes with a consequential reduction on shipping emissions, supporting the company’s aim to reduce emissions intensity levels from shipping iron ore by 50% from 2021 levels by 2030.

The findings of a report, commissioned by Fortescue and published prior to COP30, support Forrest’s ambition, indicating that the world has reached a green tipping point. “Firmed renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy in nearly every corner of the world.”

The economics of Real Zero are clear across three sectors, according to the research, which finds:

Heavy trucking (Europe): Battery-electric long-haul trucks are projected to reach cost parity with diesel equivalents by 2026 – a tipping point for zero-emission transport.

Fertilizer (India): By 2026, green ammonia for fertilizer production will carry only a marginal cost premium over grey ammonia (made from fossil fuel) in parts of India, and by 2030 will undercut grey ammonia in renewables-rich regions.

Steel (Japan): Green hydrogen-based steelmaking could be cheaper than fossil routes by the early 2030s – even sooner with modest carbon pricing – while scrap-based electric arc furnace production is already cost-competitive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-fortescue-166287.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:37.884170

Lloyd’s Register (LR), EXMAR and the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) for Mobility and Transport have helped to develop interim guidelines to enable the safe use of ammonia cargo as fuel on gas carriers

The Belgium FPS Mobility and Transport, with support from LR and EXMAR, led work to secure an amendment to the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code) more than two years ago, removing restrictions previously preventing the consumption of ammonia cargo as fuel. The three stakeholders provided the initial draft of the Interim Guidelines to the IMO Correspondence Group considering the guidelines. Subsequent development involved cooperation with Member States in a Correspondence Group to ensure consensus.

The Guidelines were finalised during the IMO’s Sub-Committee on the Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC 11) and are expected to be formally approved at MSC 111 in May 2026.

Ammonia has long been recognised for its potential as a zero-carbon fuel, but until recently ammonia cargo could not be used as fuel on gas carriers certified in accordance with the IGC Code. The new framework balances safety and flexibility, allowing shipowners and operators to move forward with ammonia-fuelled vessel designs under a recognised regulatory pathway.

Claudene Sharp-Patel, Global Technical Director, LR, said: “This collaboration shows what’s possible when industry leaders, regulators and technical experts come together to enable change. LR has been involved in ammonia-as-fuel projects from their earliest stages through to realisation. The deep knowledge and expertise we’ve developed directly benefit our clients as they look to decarbonise their fleets. Being part of this pioneering work reinforces LR’s position as a trusted advisor and innovation leader in the maritime energy transition.”

Kristof Coppé, Director Fleet Operations and Technical Business Development, EXMAR, said: “EXMAR’s journey toward ammonia as a marine fuel began in 2021, when our company received Approval in Principle from Lloyd’s Register for an ammonia-fuelled mid-size gas carrier. Using our own cargo as fuel has long been a strategic priority for EXMAR. A commitment previously demonstrated through our pioneering adoption of LPG as a propulsion fuel. Ammonia now marks the next step forward, offering the added benefit of reducing direct CO₂ emissions by up to 90 percent.

“Our close collaboration with Lloyd’s Register and FPS Mobility in Belgium has been instrumental throughout this process. Their support, particularly on the regulatory front, has been a cornerstone in advancing this project toward success.”

Nathalie Deleuze, Maritime Expert – Alternative Fuels at FPS Mobility and Transport of Belgium, said: “Decarbonisation is a key priority for Belgium. At the FPS Mobility and Transport, we’re committed to facilitating the shift toward alternative fuels. To make this happen, we combined our expertise in IMO processes with the technical know-how of pioneering Belgian shipowners and Lloyd’s Register. Together, we’re charting the course toward a cleaner future.”

LR’s Fuel for Thought: Ammonia gathers into one place the most relevant information on the use of ammonia in shipping, serving as a convenient reference for shipowners considering alternative fuel options for their fleets, and for maritime professionals seeking a deeper understanding of the zero-carbon transition. The report combines expertise from LR and other shipping knowledge leaders on topics including the current state of ammonia as a clean fuel, including its safety considerations, drivers for adoption, production and supply chain, and technology readiness.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:50.459070

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.
These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government.
Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.
“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.","Australia’s Albanese Government has opened five new areas for bidding in the Otway Basin for offshore gas exploration to lower power prices, in order to ensure that the domestic industry has access to gas at affordable prices, the country’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources said Dec. 11.

The release of new areas follows a review of the process for making new offshore acreage available for exploration and extensive consultation with the industry and stakeholders, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia Madeleine King said on the department’s website.

The development also follows an announcement by the Victorian Government on Dec. 10 to release petroleum exploration permits in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said.

“The release of new acreage supports our Future Gas Strategy and will help ensure Australians continue to have access to gas at affordable prices,” she added.

The Future Gas Strategy maps the Australian Government’s plan for how gas will support the country’s transition to net zero.

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.

All projects will be required to meet strict environmental and emissions standards per usual processes, she said.

Public consultation on the nominated new areas will be open for eight weeks until Feb. 6, 2026, while applications for the exploration permits will close on June 30 next year, she said.

These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government. This offshore acreage complements South Australia’s and the Victorian State Government’s exploration programs, she added.

Releasing new acreage would help address the structural gas shortfalls forecast from 2029 by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the statement said, recognizing that tackling shortfalls is vital for manufacturers who require gas as a feedstock or as a heat source and cannot transition to alternatives in the short to medium term.

Industry welcomes move

In a separate statement on Dec. 11, the Australian Energy Producers said that it welcomed the release of new acreage.

Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.

“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.

“Bringing new gas supply online sooner is the only sustainable solution to put downward pressure on prices,” she added.

In June, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources stated on its website that it was conducting a Gas Market Review in conjunction with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

The review aims to examine the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, the Gas Market Code and the Heads of Agreement with east coast LNG exporters, it said at the time.

“With the outcome of the gas market review expected to be announced shortly, we will continue to work with governments on measures to increase gas supply and ensure Australian homes and businesses have reliable and affordable energy,” McCulloch added.

Australia is among the world’s top LNG exporters, with market participants monitoring the country’s production prospects to determine global demand-supply balances and the impact on international prices of the fuel.

According to the Resources and Energy Quarterly report by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources earlier this year, Australia’s LNG export volumes are forecast to reach 82 million mt/year in the fiscal year 2026-27 (July-June), up from a forecast of 80 million mt/year in FY 2025-26.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:56.944358

The report finds that while ships are becoming more fuel-efficient, rising economic activity, longer trade routes, and structural fleet trends continue to offset these gains. Shipping represented roughly 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2024—placing it on par with some G7 economies.

Container and Bulk Carriers Drive the Sector’s Footprint

Container ships and bulk carriers account for nearly half of global maritime CO₂ emissions. Over the five-year period, container ship emissions rose 14.7% while bulk carrier emissions increased 10.6%. The OECD attributes the spike largely to increased global trade volumes and higher transport intensity—tonne-miles growing faster than GDP.

Fleet characteristics also play a role. Vessels aged 20 years and older now number nearly 80,000 globally, up from about 70,000 in 2019, extending reliance on older, fossil-fueled hulls. Meanwhile, mega-containerships over 10,000 TEU now represent about 42% of the world’s container capacity. While these larger vessels offer better per-tonne fuel performance, they also lock in long-lived fossil infrastructure.

Efficiency Is Improving, but It’s Not Enough

The analysis uses a decomposition method to identify major forces influencing emissions. Fuel intensity—the fuel required per unit of nominal capacity—showed the strongest downward effect, indicating that ships are operating more efficiently due to slow steaming, operational improvements, and compliance with IMO’s Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). These regulatory shifts, however, have not significantly altered the sector’s fuel mix, which remains dominated by oil-based fuels despite growth in LNG and early adoption of methanol-ready designs.

Distance-driven emissions turned positive in the latter part of the period. Geopolitical disruptions—including Red Sea rerouting, Panama Canal constraints from drought, and altered trade flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—pushed vessels onto longer routes. This added millions of tonne-miles to global shipping activity and reduced the emissions benefits gained through efficiency.

Capacity utilization trends vary by region. Globally, underutilization has increased emissions by leaving more tonnage in operation than needed. In the OECD fleet, utilization improved slightly, exerting a modest downward effect.

Implications for Policy and the Maritime Transition

The OECD’s findings underscore the scale of the challenge facing the maritime sector as it works toward the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition and interim 2030 and 2040 reduction targets. Efficiency gains alone continue to be overtaken by market-driven factors—particularly the growth of global trade and rerouted maritime corridors.

Regulations entering force after 2024 will exert stronger pressure. The EU Emissions Trading System now applies to large ships entering European ports, and FuelEU Maritime will begin limiting the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels. These measures are expected to push operators toward low-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, or advanced biofuels—pathways that E+E Leader reporting has shown carry both potential and sustainability risks.

For companies with maritime-linked supply chains, the report highlights rising exposure to carbon costs and route volatility. Many firms are already reevaluating procurement strategies, assessing the carbon intensity of shipping partners, and tracking whether carriers invest in alternative-fuel vessels.

The OECD’s analysis ultimately reinforces a key trend across the global transport sector: operational efficiency is improving, but structural patterns in trade, fleet composition, and fuel availability are determining emissions outcomes. Without accelerated investment in low-carbon fuels and technologies, maritime emissions are likely to remain on an upward trajectory despite regulatory tightening.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251211-121247-b98-Ships%20and%20communication%20network%20concept.%20maritime%20traffic..jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:56:54.818319

The company aims to provide the global shipping industry with a new green, intelligent and sustainable development path. CATL expects that battery-electric ships will soon be active not only on rivers, lakes and harbours, but on the oceans.

Su Yiyi, Head of CATL’s Marine Division, stated at Marintec China: “CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes and coastal waters and is now evolving towards deep-sea applications. In the near future – possibly within the next three years – we will see fully electric ships on the open sea.”

Ships with a fragmented supplier system

According to CATL, the shipping industry currently faces a fundamental challenge: propulsion, energy supply and maintenance of a ship are typically managed by different partners, leading to coordination issues and unclear responsibilities. Additionally, battery-electric ships face high acquisition costs, a lack of energy infrastructure, range anxiety, complex water conditions and inconsistent technical standards.

These factors represent a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of zero-emission shipping. Moreover, technologies from road transport cannot simply be transferred to ships, as their development must account for extremely demanding conditions such as high humidity, salt spray, long operating hours and high power requirements.

CATL’s new complete solution for battery-electric ships

This is where CATL’s integrated “Ship-Shore-Cloud” solution comes into play. According to the company, it is a bespoke complete solution for the shipping industry, featuring seamless integration from onboard energy systems to landside charging and battery-swapping networks, and cloud-based intelligent management. This approach aims to eliminate the traditional weaknesses of the industry’s fragmented multi-supplier structures.

Onboard, the system integrates batteries, propulsion and intelligent navigation systems to ensure safe and stable operation. On land, a network of charging and battery-swapping stations, along with the “ship-battery separation” model, is designed to significantly reduce energy and cost risks.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems. One example is the excursion ship Yujian 77, which operates in Xiamen Bay and has already been featured by us. CATL is also proud of the Changjiang Sanxia 1, the world’s largest fully electric inland passenger ship, and the Qinggang Tug 1, China’s first hybrid tugboat. Additionally, with the Jining 6006, CATL has demonstrated that battery swapping for cargo ships is feasible.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios.","The shipping industry's ongoing battle with container losses at sea reveals a complex web of environmental consequences and supply chain vulnerabilities that extend far beyond the initial moment cargo goes overboard.

Each year, thousands of containers slip into the ocean, transforming single shipping incidents into chronic pollution sources that persist for decades while simultaneously disrupting global trade networks.

The mechanics behind these losses combine natural forces with human and technical failures. Rough seas, high waves and strong winds create the immediate physical threat, particularly when containers are improperly stacked or inadequately lashed. Human factors including fatigue, poor communication and complacency during loading operations compound these risks, while mechanical issues such as valve failures or uneven weight distribution further exacerbate the problem.

Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC) says: ""Even one container lost is one too many.”

Decades of marine plastic pollution

A February 1997 incident involving the Tokio Express, operating under Evergreen Marine's service at the time, demonstrates how a single container loss can become a long-term environmental liability. Hit by a large wave off the coast of Cornwall, the vessel lost 62 containers overboard, including one loaded with millions of Lego pieces.

The lost cargo has washed up for decades on beaches in Southwest England, making it one of the best-known examples of traceable marine plastic pollution. Many of the Lego pieces were ocean-themed items such as flippers and octopuses, providing marine scientists with valuable long-term data on plastic persistence and drift patterns.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents. Beachcombers and researchers still document finds of these distinctive pieces, creating an ongoing record of marine debris movement.

The longevity of these plastic items in the marine environment highlights the persistent nature of polymer-based materials. This single container loss has generated decades of environmental impact and scientific observation.

Perishable cargo environmental footprint

Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.

On 15 November 2025, a vessel transporting bananas for major importers and retailers lost several containers in the English Channel, leading to large numbers of loose bananas, broken boxes and associated packaging washing up along parts of the UK coast.

While the fruit itself biodegrades, the long-term environmental burden comes from non-biodegradable elements such as plastic wrap, strapping, pallets, insulation and cooler foams that persist in marine environments. These materials fragment into microplastics over time, entering the food chain.

The visual impact of perishable cargo losses often generates significant public attention and media coverage. However, the less visible packaging materials create the more enduring pollution problem.

Refrigerated containers also contain coolants and insulation materials that can release harmful substances when compromised. The environmental footprint of these losses extends well beyond the organic cargo itself.

Industrial materials contaminating coastlines

Beyond consumer goods and perishables, industrial materials constitute some of the most severe marine pollution incidents.

The X-Press Pearl incident off Sri Lanka in 2021 released 70 to 75 billion plastic pellets, known as ""nurdles"", now considered one of the largest marine plastic spills in history. The ship was operated by X-Press Feeders and carried cargo for multiple chemical and polymer producers.

These tiny plastic pellets, the raw material for plastic manufacturing, spread rapidly across vast ocean areas and coastlines. Their small size makes recovery virtually impossible, and they persist indefinitely in marine ecosystems.

Other notable cases include consumer goods such as trainers, motorbikes, televisions, whisky and IKEA products arriving on beaches after container losses on major Asia-Europe and transpacific routes. Biobeads and industrial polymers have contaminated shorelines in the UK and elsewhere, creating pollution challenges that differ markedly from organic cargo losses.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios. Each material type requires different clean-up approaches and presents unique environmental risks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/67d4c168c5d3f1fe3d45b35a36f722bd:d38a7b3e0c2c0929be02941b3ebacd31/gettyimages-1032544878.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:56:52.432224

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect.
Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.
The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.
This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.","A lot is expected of global trade nowadays when it comes to sustainability. That said, heavy freight is still widely regarded as a hard-to-abate sector.

Air and sea shipping are the main culprits here. While lorries are able to carry just a fraction of the loads of planes and boats, there are readily available electric alternatives to old school, fossil fuel-powered road vehicles.

Progress is well underway though, whether that's the development of sustainable aviation fuel or the kinds of biofuel or hydrogen that boats are experimenting with.

Regulations are being written to reflect and encourage this gradual transition too. When it comes to ships specifically, a new piece of research by the International Maritime Organization has sought to examine just how effective legislation is at the moment when it comes to nautical sustainability.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the IMO's study is full of data that could prove crucial for how supply chain professionals understand the day-to-day impact of global fuel rules.

The report, which is titled SO₂ and NOₓ emissions from ships in North‑East Atlantic waters, sets out to measure sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) directly, using aircraft and onshore sensors to sample exhaust plumes from 2019 to 2022.

This approach offers a more precise picture of emissions for a sector that operates largely beyond easy observation.

What kind of impact is tighter regulation having on shipping?

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect. Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.

By 2021, this had dropped to roughly 0.31%, and further declined to 0.25% by 2022.

Researchers concluded that “a nearly 10-fold decrease in the mean aFSC demonstrates the strong impact the International Maritime Organization regulation change in 2020 had on sulphur emissions from ships.”

The findings underline a smooth transition toward lower-sulphur fuels across the sector.

The study also gauged nitrogen oxide emissions, finding that the NOₓ/CO₂ ratio was significantly lower in ports than at sea, probably because ships rely on smaller auxiliary engines when docked – an operational factor with implications for port logistics and emission tracking.

How are companies complying with sustainable shipping restrictions?

The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.

In 2019, before the new restrictions, eight of the 19 ships sampled surpassed the 3.5% sulphur threshold then in force.

By contrast, during 2021–2022, only five of the 78 ships tested were non‑compliant under the tougher 0.5% cap. This high level of compliance demonstrates the regulation’s effectiveness, although a small proportion of breaches remains.

Failure to comply still poses risks for supply chain stakeholders, ranging from shipment delays to reputational repercussions.

Collecting this evidence required complex operations, including flying an aircraft at altitudes as low as 30 metres to capture and analyse 130 ship exhaust plumes.

The finer details of the study

Within special environmental zones like the European Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA), stretching across the English Channel, the limits are even stricter. Average sulphur content in these waters was measured at around 0.04%, well below the 0.1% ceiling.

Direct measurements enabled scientists to flag non‑compliant ships that computer models might miss. For example, one container vessel exceeded sulphur limits on the open sea but switched to cleaner fuel closer to shore within SECA boundaries.

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a0d4400bb489589df7433fda5bd66a6c:0d118856c8132941191580789cbe12e2/graphics-for-work-2025-12-10t172834-228.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:04.742795

The new group plans to work with President Trump’s Administration and Congress to establish strong policies that accelerate the use of American-made energy and biofuels in the global maritime sector – thereby establishing U.S. dominance in the future of international maritime shipping.

Adding biofuels such as ethanol, biomethane, bio-LNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel, among others, to the existing maritime fuel portfolio can fill opportunity gaps and help shippers meet both their economic and environmental goals.

Maritime fuel policies and international frameworks are developing rapidly. Incentivizing the increased use of biofuels creates an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made energy produced from feedstocks grown in the United States like corn, sorghum, and soybeans, as well as the organic byproducts and farm waste from several domestic industries. The maritime sector represents a new opportunity to strongly position American farmers and fuel producers to lead in a developing market, leveraging existing infrastructure and encouraging new investments in energy and maritime sectors while enhancing the economic resilience of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

ABMI will advocate for policies that expand market access for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers in maritime applications, and the advancement of technologies that deploy these advanced fuels, planning to work with the Trump Administration and Congress to establish the U.S. as a global leader in maritime fuels policy.

“Every day, America generates organic waste that should be turned into clean, domestic energy. U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies. The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of RFA and ABMI co-chair, said: “The maritime sector represents an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from crops grown across America’s heartland. U.S. ethanol is one of the lowest-cost alternative maritime fuels available at scale and represents an incredibly competitive option for the shipping industry worldwide.”

Thoughtfully crafted international frameworks and national policies can drive demand for U.S. agricultural and waste-derived fuels and therefore support American farmers, biofuel producers, and the rural communities that produce them.

This legislation is poised to transform India’s maritime sector by replacing the outdated Merchant Shipping Act of 1958. The urgency to pass the bill was marked by ongoing disruptions related to separate demands concerning electoral roll discussions in Bihar.

The new bill significantly updates the definition of “vessels,” expanding it to encompass various types of watercraft, including mobile offshore drilling units and submersibles. It allows for partial ownership of vessels by Indian citizens, corporations, and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), subject to regulations that the central government will define. An important provision is the temporary registration of unregistered vessels intended for recycling in India, which is expected to invigorate recycling operations, particularly at hubs like Alang.

A key feature of the Merchant Shipping Bill is the empowerment of the Director-General to oversee maritime education and training. This measure aims to ensure that Indian seafarers receive quality education, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the global maritime arena. Additionally, the bill mandates pollution prevention certificates for all vessels, aligning India’s regulations with international standards by incorporating treaties such as MARPOL and the Wreck Removal Convention. This aims to reinforce environmental protection within the industry.

The bill further addresses ownership criteria, thereby enhancing India’s shipping capabilities and fleet size, which could position Indian shipping companies to compete effectively on a global scale. Moreover, the legislation aligns with international maritime labor standards, establishes a certification system for Indian seafarers, and ensures access to social security, thus fostering improved welfare and working conditions for seafarers.

Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, highlighted that the global maritime industry has witnessed notable changes in recent years, creating challenges that necessitated reforms in the outdated 1958 act. The adjustments in ownership and the revamped regulatory framework aim to modernize the maritime sector, boost competitiveness, and align with international benchmarks to meet evolving demands.

In conclusion, the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024, represents a substantial leap towards modernizing India’s maritime landscape. Its comprehensive provisions emphasize safety, security, sustainability, and the economic potential of the maritime industry, promising growth and better social welfare outcomes. This legislation is positioned to enhance India’s role in global maritime trade and bolster the industry’s overall effectiveness.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lok-Sabha-Approves-Merchant-Shipping-Bill-2024-Maritime-Revolution.webp.webp,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:15.332516
