Blue Energy serves as the Norway office of bunker supplier Global Energy Supply, and operates as a dedicated unit focused on delivering environmental and regulatory-driven energy solutions for their partners.

Uncertainty over the proliferation of GHG emissions regulations for shipping is driving demand for its services, Trine Braathen, the company's director of environmental trading, said in an interview with Ship & Bunker.

Braathen noted the information she provided is intended for industry insights only and should not be considered as specific guidance for purchasing or selling allowances. Specific cases may differ and should be evaluated individually, and Blue Energy assumes no responsibility for any decisions made based on this information.

""What we're seeing, and have seen for a few years, is that the regulatory landscape is changing on both mandatory and voluntary developments,"" Braathen said.

""There are lots of things happening at the EU level, national levels and also, of course, the IMO level concerning the shipping segment.

""There's no doubt that the green initiatives and the green regulatory changes are in super-focus in the industry at the moment, because of course this represents something new; it represents complexity, and it represents something most of the shipping companies are not really fully aware of or understand fully, and it's definitely not their core competence.

""Our role, and why we see it as a business opportunity, is precisely because of this uncertainty.

""It's where we can use our expertise and knowledge, and share that with our customers and stakeholders.""

GHG Services

The EUA market is Blue Energy's primary focus for shipping at present.

But the company is also preparing to offer biofuels, both B100 and blended products.

Compliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation may also become part of its business in time, Braathen said.

""Of course, FuelEU Maritime is definitely something that we will investigate quite a bit in December to see what our role is in the market, where can we actually provide our expertise and guidance,"" she said.

""As a company, we will focus on being a supplier, so we would not necessarily go on the emission side into reporting, for example, or verification.""

The firm is also starting to see interest from shipping companies in UK Allowance procurement for compliance with the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Domestic shipping will be added to the UK ETS next year, and international shipping from 2028.

EUA Procurement Strategy

The firm has seen a variety of approaches to EUA procurement for EU-ETS compliance in its work with shipping companies.

""What we're seeing at the moment is lots of different types of procurement strategies,"" Braathen said.

""The most common one is just to buy per voyage; I think at least for the mid-size and bigger fleets, that's definitely the norm.

""But for the smaller companies, it's quite interesting, they don't have the liquidity or the budget and so forth, and they are just bundling the volume and buying it as late as possible.""

A more complex approach may bear dividends, for those willing to become more deeply involved in these markets.

""There's room for improvement for these types of strategies, but it all depends on risk preference and risk exposure,"" Braathen said.

""It depends on, would you allow to only buy these allowances, or would you allow to also sell them.

""And if you buy them, bundling some volume ... and suddenly the market price dropped by 15%, in your governance and policy are you then stuck with that position, or are you allowing it to be sold back to the market and then buy it back at a lower price?

""And of course, it comes down to liquidity in the company.

""Do they actually have the liquidity to hedge for future years and so forth? It depends a bit on which type of company, but we definitely see discussions which are much more advanced than a year ago.""

EUA Savings

Braathen points to volatility in the EUA price this year as evidence of the potential savings to be made by altering strategy.

""Let's look at an example I gave to a customer about this a few days ago, where we just looked at prices during the autumn of this year,"" she said.

""Imagine if you were buying volume on, let's say, August 1, at EUR 71/mtCO2e.

""Let's say, to simplify it, you had a volume of 100,000 mtCO2e that you needed to buy, and then at 71 you buy all the volume because you believe that's a good price.

""Then you have another company waiting and waiting, and they decide to buy volume on November 1 instead, and they buy at EUR 82/mtCO2e.

""They have the same volume, but it's a substantial difference in this price just within those three months.""

The EUA price has averaged around EUR 73.41/mtCO2e so far this year, with a low of EUR 60/mtCO2e in April and a high of EUR 83/mtCO2e in November, according to Ship & Bunker data.

""I think a lot of companies don't necessarily understand the implications of this, because of course if you don't include that into your contract ... if you are a bit delaying the purchase or not having a proper strategy around it, then having these types of changes in prices could have a significant impact on the compliance cost and how it's spread out to your stakeholders and customers,"" Braathen said.

""You have what becomes a competitive advantage if you manage to time the purchase correctly, and what could be a significant disadvantage compared to your competitors if you buy at a terrible price level.""

IMO Delay

Another area Blue Energy might be interested in engaging with would be the IMO's Net-Zero Framework, which if adopted would include an element of buying and selling GHG compliance units to meet its thresholds.

The UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee decided in October to put off a vote on the framework by a year.

Braathen questions whether consensus can be reached to pass the deal in its current format within that timeframe, but remains optimistic over the long-term prospects for global GHG regulation for shipping.

""At the moment, with all the lobbying from the US side, it is challenging to see how they will manage to change that sentiment within the year,"" she said.

""But the IMO have the opportunity now to maybe simplify it a bit and look at what they could actually control, It's not necessarily all about the financial aspects of this carbon framework.

""But of course, I am quite positive.

""I believe that at some point there will be a global carbon market for shipping; whether it's next year, or if it will take more time, let's see.

""What most of the member states want, of course, everyone wants; a fair, simplified system which makes sense.

""To get to that framework and find a compromise which everyone can live with, that's the challenging part, but from a regulatory perspective it makes so much sense to have a global system.""",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_78b80c7c50864c9f516ee7b292bcaad1.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:56:45.661214

Imports of steel into the European Economic Area will face a carbon tax under the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting on January 1. The decarbonisation-oriented levy will also apply to cement, electricity, fertilisers and other products.

Mills in India, the world’s second-largest crude steel producer after China, ship roughly two-thirds of their exports to Europe.

Experts say Indian mills will need to cut their carbon emissions.

“We recognise that we have to do environment-friendly production and companies are gearing up to comply, but they are also looking at alternative markets too,” Aruna Sharma, India’s former steel secretary, told Reuters.

Most of India’s steel is produced in blast furnaces, which generate higher emissions, said Sandeep Poundrik, the top civil servant at the Ministry of Steel, in September. He also said further expansion of blast furnace capacity is a concern.

Additional planned capacity could add about 680 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions from the sector, according to Global Energy Monitor, a U.S.-based research group.

Indian steelmakers have planned new investments to lift output as strong domestic demand – fuelled by government-backed infrastructure spending – continues to rise.

“Most of the companies are yet figuring out a way to deal with CBAM,” said Ravi Sodah, a cement, metals and mining analyst at Elara Capital. “In the near term, it is expected to slow down India’s exports to EU.”

One way to mitigate the problem is to use electric arc furnaces, which emit far less carbon than conventional blast furnaces.

Two executives at large Indian steelmakers, who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said companies had little clarity on how the tax would be calculated.

“About 60% of our exports go to Europe and we want to know what is the rate that will be levied and will it be company specific?” said one of the executives.

The levy will raise the cost of Indian steel exports to the EU, especially blast furnace products, squeezing margins and EU market share unless producers cut emissions, said Lakshmanan R, head of South & Southeast Asia corporates at CreditSights in Singapore.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:10.847008

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand.
Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050.
Still, even by 2050 demand remains at robust levels despite faster electrification and more aggressive government policies to reduce GHG emissions”.
The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller.","It seems that the tanker market will experience diverging paths amongst its various classes, but mainly between crude and product tanker in the years to come. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “the 2025 edition of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) arrived at a moment of mounting turbulence, driven by geopolitical tensions, major changes in energy policies and increasing debate how to address climate risks. Updated each year with the latest data and market trends, the WEO is not a forecast but an exploration of possible energy futures shaped by evolving policies, technologies, and market forces. In this year’s edition, three key pathways are detailed. The Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published prior to Covid, is re-introduced in this year’s addition and assumes no new governmental policy actions beyond those already in place. It presents a cautious view of how quickly new energy technologies can be scaled up. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) takes the analysis one step further and incorporates all officially announced government plans, even though they have not yet been adopted. Barriers to adopting new technologies are lower than in the CPS. The Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is theoretical and lists the conditions required to achieve net-zero CO₂ by 2050”.

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand. Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050. Growth is underpinned by increased use of oil in road transport in emerging market and developing economies, aviation, shipping and petrochemical demand. Here, the assumption is made that the share of EVs in total car sales plateaus after 2035 at around 40%. In contrast, STEPS shows oil demand flattening near 100.4 mbd by 2035 before easing to around 96.9 mbd in 2050, reflecting faster uptake of electric vehicles and higher efficiency standards. Still, even by 2050 demand remains at robust levels despite faster electrification and more aggressive government policies to reduce GHG emissions”.

Meanwhile, “supply growth is dominated by the Middle East, although the scale differs between the scenarios, with production up by 13.7 mbd by 2050 in CPS and by 6.9 mbd in STEPS. Latin America also sees strong growth, although on a much smaller scale. In North America, production rises through 2035 but declines thereafter, with a sharper downward trend in STEPS. Oil production in Europe and Asia Pacific declines sharply in both scenarios. In Asia, a region that accounts for much of global demand growth, supply falls by 2.6 mbd or 3.2 mbd by 2050 depending on the case. Meanwhile, Africa’s production falls significantly in STEPS, while remaining broadly steady-ish in CPS”, the shipbroker noted.

“Global refining runs also evolve differently. A much stronger demand base under CPS drives significant throughput increases in Asia in both the medium and long term, whilst smaller yet notable increases are also seen in the Middle East, Africa, and North America. European runs continue to decline due to structural weakness in regional demand and competitive disadvantages relative to refineries East of Suez and the US. The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller. Still, the main difference involves the US runs, where throughput comes under downward pressure in line with a faster demand decline”, Gibson noted.

So, what will be the impact on tankers? According to the shipbroker, “the CPS provides a much more optimistic view for tanker demand than STEPS, but the reality is likely to sit somewhere in between. Much depends on the pace of technological development and future government policy choices. Still, even with different demand paths, several tanker trade trends are consistent across both scenarios. Rising crude production in Latin America, falling refining runs in Europe, declining oil output but rising refining runs in Asia – they all point to incremental long-haul crude trade. Both scenarios also show solid growth in Middle East crude exports”.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:17.205730

Saleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global explains.

The Paradox

The maritime industry faces a paradox: recently Yemen’s Houthi rebels signalled a cessation of Red Sea attacks following the recent Gaza ceasefire. Around the same time, Iran executed its first vessel seizure in months, seizing the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, 14 November 2025. These two developments underscore a critical reality: regional maritime security remains fragmented, unpredictable, and expensive.

After 690 days of Houthi attacks that killed nine mariners and sank four vessels, the conditional ceasefire offers cautious optimism. Yet, Suez Canal traffic remains at historic lows, averaging just 36 vessels daily in 2025 compared to 74 in 2023. Insurance premiums tell the story though and insurers aren’t convinced. Red Sea war-risk rates remain elevated despite the announcement; as underwriters demand proof through multiple safe transits, before reducing coverage costs that currently add tens of thousands of dollars per voyage.

Iran’s seizure of the Talara, carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemicals through waters handling 20% of global oil trade, signals Tehran’s willingness to reassert control in the Strait of Hormuz. The incident prompted war-risk premiums in the Middle East Gulf to double within days, while hull and machinery insurance jumped 60%.

Impact on Safe Passage

These developments have an impact on safe passage and come with three key implications:

1. Bifurcated Geographic Risk: The Red Sea may experience gradual normalisation while Persian Gulf risks intensify, forcing carriers to reassess route optimisation strategies across two distinct zones simultaneously.

2. Insurance Market Volatility: War-risk premiums will remain fluid and regionally specific, with 24-hour quote validities and 96-hour cancellation clauses now standard practice, eliminating predictable cost structures for voyage planning.

3. Extended Cape Routing Persistence: Despite the Houthi pause, major carriers will maintain Cape of Good Hope diversions through at least Q2 2026, sustaining 10-14 day transit delays and suppressing Suez Canal revenues while creating potential freight rate collapse when capacity eventually returns.

Stakeholder Actions

Stakeholders across the supply chain can implement various measures to deal with these challenges. Fleet owners should consider implementing dynamic voyage insurance strategies with multiple underwriters, rather than single-carrier contracts. Exploring the use of real-time intelligence platforms for routing decisions that balance premium costs against time-charter economics is also advised.

In comparison, cargo insurers ought to adopt granular, passage-level risk assessment using vessel ownership transparency data and beneficial owner verification to differentiate premium pricing. They would also do well to consider fleet-based bundling arrangements for operators with strong compliance records.

Port authorities can act by enhancing berth scheduling flexibility to accommodate last-minute routing changes. It is also recommended to coordinate with maritime security agencies on threat intelligence, sharing protocols for vessels calling from high-risk transit zones.

Vessel crews can act by verifying that comprehensive war-risk coverage explicitly includes Red Sea and Persian Gulf waters before transit; and it is worthwhile maintaining heightened vigilance for GPS jamming and AIS interference, particularly near the Straits of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandeb chokepoints.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:34.916580

Theofilos Mozas from Greece. This session addresses critical issues from maritime security enhancements to regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies and certification requirements. The discussions are key for shaping global safety standards aimed at protecting human lives and the environment.

### Addressing Maritime Security

A pressing concern includes rising threats in the Red Sea, highlighted by recent ship attacks and the hijacking of the MV Galaxy Leader. With more than 40 incidents reported, the MSC aims to implement measures to mitigate these risks and bolster the safety of seafarers in affected areas. A proposed resolution condemning these attacks underscores the urgent need for collective action against maritime security threats.

### Autonomous Shipping

As the industry moves towards autonomous vessels, the MSC is developing a non-mandatory code for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). This code is essential for integrating these ships safely into existing maritime operations while ensuring compliance with safety standards applicable to traditional vessels.

### Sustainable Maritime Operations

In response to climate change pressures, the committee is working on a safety regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. This framework is pivotal for the IMO’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions in shipping through the adoption of innovative technologies and alternative fuels. It will address safety complexities and risks associated with implementing low-emission technologies.

### Protecting Seafarers

The committee’s agenda also focuses on the human element in maritime operations, particularly addressing violence and harassment. Proposed amendments to the Seafarers’ Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to enhance protections for seafarers, providing essential training and support to combat abuse and harassment.

### Modifications to Certification Standards

Recognizing the need for updated certification requirements, the MSC is seeking to revise the International Convention on Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F Convention). These adjustments will cater to the evolving fishing industry, standardize qualifications, and improve safety for fishing vessel workers.

### Addressing Other Emerging Challenges

The MSC’s agenda includes reviewing safety measures outlined in the 1974 SOLAS Convention, tackling piracy and armed robbery, and analyzing reports from its subcommittees. Their comprehensive approach also focuses on improving navigational aids and ensuring the safe transport of hazardous cargo.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-07 10:56:10.794402

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been at the very heart of the US policy maelstrom that rocked global shipping in 2025.

USTR policies on port fees have forced widespread vessel deployments, and tariffs based on USTR investigations have caused global shifts in cargo flows. Some shipowners have profited; others have lost.

The shipping industry was forced into Herculean efforts on contingency planning, only to see the port fees paused for a year on November 10 as part of the US-China trade agreement.

Countless ships were rerouted, vessels were refinanced to remove Chinese sale-leaseback exposure, time and money was spent on rebuttals to USTR proposals, and it all ended up being a bargaining chip in a much bigger game.

02 / Li Chenggang, China International Trade Representative

China, for whom Li Chenggang is the International Trade Representative, responded to the US port fee plan with tit-for-tat fees for ships linked to the US, calling them “necessary acts of passive defence”.

Its measures largely mirrored those of the US, even down to the lack of clarity about how “ownership” and “vessel operator” were defined.

There was consternation over how China would calculate the 25% US ownership threshold — but fees on all US-listed fleets would be far-reaching.

Fearnley Securities estimated the extra costs per call at $6m for a very large crude carrier, $5m for a capesize and $20 per tonne for a liquefied petroleum gas cargo.

03 / Marco Rubio, US State Secretary

Donald Trump’s White House and the departments of State and Energy were absent from the April meeting that approved the International Maritime Organization’s landmark Net-Zero Framework.

They more than made up for it next time round. State secretary Marco Rubio, energy secretary Chris Wright and transportation secretary Sean Duffy came out swinging against the NZF, and the economic threat it presented to the US (or more likely the relatively cheap political win it represented against UN agencies with green ambitions for industry) over the next six months.

What followed was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force to kill the NZF, including bullying, threats and intimidation against delegates from countries much weaker than the US. Rubio contacted several nations personally to promise retaliation if countries voted Yes.

The US and Saudi Arabia eventually won a one-year delay, which many think is the end of the IMO work plan — and thus the end of the industry hope of global carbon pricing.

04 / Mohammad Ayoub, Saudi Arabia (UNFCCC delegate)

While the headline-grabbing threats by the US were seen as the major blocker of the NZF, Saudi Arabia has long been the leader of the IMO bloc most opposed to green regulations.

The US and Saudi call to adopt the NZF under the old system of “explicit acceptance” — to ensure it never enters into force, even if it passes — was a deft procedural attack, throwing the EU and other delegates off guard and threatening to undermine the functioning of the IMO itself.

Saudi Arabia’s UNFCCC delegate, Mohammad Ayoub, was brought for this year’s two MEPCs to do what he does best: oppose, oppose, oppose.

Saudi Arabia also submitted several detailed documents listing the various reasons for countries to reject the green scheme they had approved just six months earlier, citing studies to argue carbon taxes would raise food prices for poor countries.

05 / Arsenio Dominguez, International Maritime Organization

Keeping October’s extraordinary MEPC meeting (there’s no better word for it) from going off the rails was arguably the biggest challenge an IMO secretary-general has yet faced.

Arsenio Dominguez narrowly avoided presiding over a rejection of the NZF, or a total collapse of the talks. He told delegates not to celebrate the outcome, but to “come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate”.

Dominguez made it his trademark never to answer when journalists asked what would happen should the NZF not be adopted. His job could well depend on whether it goes through next year.

06 / Sveinung Oftedal, chair, IMO ISWG-GHG (Norway delegate)

Norway’s IMO delegate Sveinung Oftedal chairs the IMO’s intersessional working group on greenhouse gases, ISWG-GHG. It is that forum, not the main chamber, where the real horse trading on carbon pricing usually takes place (perhaps because it’s closed to journalists).

Oftedal has sought gradually to build consensus on a plan that worked. He was instrumental in forming what became the NZF, which passed by a majority vote in April. That majority included Brazil and China, which had been significant critics.

Pacific Islands pushing for a flat carbon levy complained that their plan was sidelined, while the EU27 reckoned that such a levy would never fly. Oftedal got a global carbon price closer than anyone else has — no small achievement.

07 / Maria Angelicoussis, Angelicoussis Group

Greek shipowners have made no secret of their scepticism of carbon pricing. But the intervention in September by a group of six big players, led by Maria Angelicoussis, was important.

The support of the group, which has made big investments in liquefied natural gas fuel, was enough to sway the governments of Greece and Cyprus to abstain from the vote to postpone the framework, breaking with the rest of the EU27.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has since called for Europe to rethink its green agenda more broadly. Let’s see how that plays out now that the EU’s are the only significant emissions rules for shipping in place for the foreseeable future.

08 / General Mamadi Doumbouya, junta leader, Guinea

After nearly 30 years, the $23bn Simandou mine is set to take the tiny African nation of Guinea from nowhere to the world’s third-biggest iron ore exporter.

The biggest mining project on the planet has the potential to reshape the global iron ore trade, giving China the advantage and displacing the dominance of Australia’s Pilbara region, with big ramifications for dry bulk shipping.

General Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in Guinea in 2021, is arguably more responsible than any other person for making Simandou happen, forcing mining giant Rio Tinto and its Chinese partners to share the huge costs of developing a railway and port.

09 / Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, European Commission

The setback at the IMO makes the European Commission — represented in this list by Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas — the most significant regulator of shipping’s environment impacts for the foreseeable future.

The ETS and FuelEU Maritime regulations continue to be implemented, and a small industry has sprung up in response on advising companies how to pool and trade compliance surplus to avoid having to pay for biofuels or penalties.

The commission has kept shtum on whether it plans to carry out its threat to extend the schemes to cover 100% of voyages to and from EU ports, from 50% today, if the IMO does not deliver.

But another IMO delay in 2026, or a failure of the NZF altogether, makes such a tax hike far more likely.

10 / Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping

The shipowners’ association, the International Chamber of Shipping, continues to be the main voice of the industry in IMO debates. It will have its work cut out for it next year as the role of industry associations diminishes and great-power politics takes over the carbon price debate.

But the ICS — represented in this list by Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos — remains influential in lobbying governments on industry topics including safety and security, alternative fuels and seafarer well-being.

In the two centuries international shipping has transitioned from sail to steam, and from coal to oil propulsion. As a result of the need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the industry is now on the brink of a ‘Fourth Propulsion Revolution’, possibly using a combination of hydrogen/ammonia and batteries powered from renewable energy sources.

Hi, Diana Stinson, President and owner of Texas Global Services. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. Also, this is a wonderful article by the Chamber (International Chamber of Shipping). Although, the author is unknown, this article shows the shipping industry coming in strong to meet the ambitious CO2 emissions target set by the IMO. Decarbonizing shipping and using zero-carbon technologies seems so far off. 2030 is just five years away and there needs to be a 40% efficiency improvement? I don’t see it happening that fast but I see the solution happening that fast. Hydrogen, ammonia and electricity powered ships? Wind powered ships? These ideas are bold and I love to share them with you. Are they realistic you ask. This cannot be in production already, can it?

The Blue Marlin Inland Solar cargo ship is already in operation. It is a hybrid ship that uses solar power to bring their emissions down considerably. Also, can be powered on solar alone for limited time. So the short answer is yes. These ideas are bold and they are realistic. The 106,000 HP engine that runs container ships is a huge ask to replace. Using ideas that reduce these emissions is the least we can do. Are we doing more? Yes. Pyxis Ocean’s maiden voyage was in June of this year. She is a wind powered hybrid that has experienced over 1/3 reduction in emissions using rigid sails. Hydrogen cell using vessels are in production for inland cargo ships and a California Coastal Research Vessel. I do see even bigger ideas becoming realities. Norway has a Sea Zero that is amazing. Fully electric cruise ship with retractable sails to be used on coastal Norwegian routes.

I’m very happy with the things I’m seeing to reduce the amount of carbon from the shipping industry. My industry of 22 years. There is much to be done. How much is in production I am unsure. The solutions have come and they are being implemented. There’s many cargo ships in the world, 58,000 says Google. I see opportunities for new companies and existing companies. Humanity comes together when they are needed the most. We are seeing that now. I’m still proud to be moving freight and am looking to the future that is coming fast.",https://www.texasglobalservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hydrogen-ship-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:56:08.685415

While the global shipping industry faces steep challenges in cutting emissions, Patrick Kettschau, managing director of Everllence China, points to China’s integrated supply chain — from shipyards to alternative fuel production — as a critical solution.

“While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,” he said.

“This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.”

As the world’s largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

“These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,” he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China’s energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create “near-zero carbon “shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year’s United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

“With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,” he said.",,N,,2025-12-05 06:56:58.211930

At Marintec China, the world's largest maritime exhibition, companies from across the world are showcasing their latest green innovations. Wu Bin reports from Shanghai.

Marintec China has been held for over four decades, but this is the first year the exhibition features a dedicated section on decarbonization in the shipping sector.

GONG KANGKANG Head, International Organizing Committee for Marintec ""Our current IMO zero-carbon framework has now entered the final stage of implementation. We also needs a platform to bring together global resources to drive the application of decarbonization technologies—from research and development to commercial deployment.""

One key aspect of decarbonization is the use of clean energy.

Currently, the shipping industry mainly relies on LNG and methanol.

More companies are now developing equipment that runs on another fuel: ammonia, which offers higher energy output and zero carbon emissions.

This company is showcasing its latest ammonia engine, unveiled just last month and slated for delivery next year.

UWE LAUBER CEO, Everllence ""This year is a special year I would say because we see so much technology and so much change and that the shipping industry is pushing forward in terms of decarbonization, so ammonia, methanol, all these green fuels and engines and technology which is needed. You can found it here right away. Technology is ready, when the regulations are popping in, we are ready to go for it.""

This institute under CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding group, is presenting a solution called the ""Green Energy Island"", an integrated unit designed to handle all these needs at sea.

LI XIN Deputy Dean, Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute, CSSC ""The green fuel needed for future ships requires zero-carbon in both production and transportation. To meet this requirement, we have chosen to produce, store and resupply green fuel on a single offshore platform. This approach minimizes comprehensive costs, providing an effective green fuel solution for our entire maritime operations.""

Most of the new orders across the globe now come to China.

Despite some disagreements over the IMO's net-zero framework making shipowners more cautious, green innovations continue to advance.

CHEN GANG President, Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding, China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) ""During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, we have upgraded the entire green solution across all our ship products. From a low-carbon perspective, we must closely follow international regulatory requirements, maintain ongoing communication with manufacturers and supply chain partners, and deliver offshore equipment and ship products that meet market demands and regulatory standards in a timely manner.""

WU BIN Shanghai ""In October this year, the vote on adopting the International Maritime Organization's net-zero framework was postponed for a year after being rejected by the United States. But here at Marintec China, countries are pushing forward with green innovations. Experts say that the shipping industry's transition to low-carbon and sustainable practices is an unstoppable trend.
