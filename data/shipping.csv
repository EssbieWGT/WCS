In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.
Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.
Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.
Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.","EcoLog has taken an important step in the development of a liquid hydrogen import terminal in the Port of Amsterdam.

This week, the company signed an agreement in Tokyo with a group of technology partners that will supply equipment for both the future import terminal and the vessels that will transport the hydrogen.

The consortium partners,Ebara Corporation, Fukui Seisakusho, Kobe Steel, and TB Global Technologies, will provide equipment and technical solutions for EcoLog’s liquid hydrogen vessels as well as for the planned import terminal in Amsterdam.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.

It will be the first terminal of this scal worldwide. The terminal is expected to become operational around 2030 and, in its initial phase, will have an annual throughput capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and 1.8 million tonnes of liquid CO₂.

Liquid hydrogen can be transported efficiently and safely via pipelines, inland shipping, rail, and road.

Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.

Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.

Both maritime transport and terminal operations require highly specialized equipment.

EcoLog has therefore entered into a framework agreement with its partners to jointly develop and integrate this equipment into the vessels and the terminal. This includes, among other things:

Pumps for loading and unloading liquid hydrogen

Safety relief valves to reduce tank pressure in emergency situations

Heat exchangers to convert liquid hydrogen into gaseous form, enabling onward transport via pipelines after arrival

Marine loading arms for the safe loading and unloading of vessels

Based on the current planning, the company is working towards realization of the terminal in 2030.

The import of green hydrogen is essential for the development of the European hydrogen economy and for the decarbonization of industry.

Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.

The development of the terminal in the Port of Amsterdam aligns with this international cooperation and with the broader ambition to supply North-West Europe with green hydrogen.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EL2501-S01A-PH1-250616.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:57:09.692176

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today launched a new inquiry into fuel smuggling and money laundering reportedly orchestrated by Mexican drug cartels, by requesting information from 7 shipping companies about their operations and safeguards against illegal fuel trafficking.

“Drug cartels are reportedly siphoning billions of dollars’ worth of fuel to bolster their criminal empires, while they also bring drugs and violence into the United States. I want to be sure both shipping companies and the U.S. government are doing everything in their power to shut off this revenue stream. These letters are the first step in my effort to learn more about how these criminal networks operate, and where existing controls are failing,” Wyden said.

News reports this year indicate that drug cartels have diverted billions of dollars in diesel and other fuel shipments to avoid Mexican customs and operate an illegal fuel network in Mexico. Those proceeds strengthen drug cartels, which are major manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs into the United States, with responsibility for murders and brutal violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Trump has diverted law enforcement officials and resources away from ongoing investigations in order to round up immigrants with little regard for due process or prioritizing truly dangerous criminals.

Wyden requested information from TORM, Teekay, Scorpio Tankers, NORDEN, International Seaways, Frontline and CMB.Tech.

“Cracking down on this illicit industry is critical to blunt cartels’ ability to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, cocaine, and other deadly drugs in the United States, and the international shipping industry must play its part to end this lawless practice,” Wyden wrote in his letters to the shippers.

This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.
""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""
Integrating green corridors into strategy This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy.","Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell has established what it calls the first operational green corridor for shipping between Brazil and Europe.

The initiative uses a certified sustainable biofuel to power vessels along a 5,000-nautical-mile supply route, signalling a major step in decarbonising deep-sea logistics networks.

Odfjell is currently running between 12 and 15 voyages each year on this transatlantic corridor with each round trip taking approximately 40 days.

This is not a one-off trial, but a sustained operational change to its service on this route. Odfjell has committed to self-funding the initiative covering the higher cost of the greener fuel without relying on subsidies.

Harald Fotland, Odfjell's Chief Executive Officer, says ""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation.""

Securing the biofuel supply chain

The green corridor relies on a B24 sustainable biofuel blend which consists of 24% renewable biodiesel from waste sources and 76% very-low-sulphur oil. To ensure a consistent and reliable supply for its vessels, Odfjell has secured a long-term offtake agreement for this B24 blend sourced from Rio Grande Brazil. This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.

Collaboration is central to the project’s design. The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working with Odfjell to enhance efficiency and streamline port-stay processes for vessels on this route.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains. ""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The project builds upon a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to create a green transatlantic shipping route.

From an industry perspective, the initiative is seen as a vital move toward decarbonising global logistics. According to the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, shipping is responsible for about 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Knut Arild Hareide, CEO of the association, explains ""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050.""

Integrating green corridors into strategy

This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy. Odfjell has already achieved a carbon intensity reduction of more than 54% against its 2008 baseline, through a series of technical and operational improvements to its fleet.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says. The project aligns with the International Maritime Organization's 2030 targets and the European Union's Fit for 55 package.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime, noted that biofuels offer a pragmatic solution for the deep-sea shipping sector. ""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" Knut says.

The success of the supply chain will hinge on ongoing work with ports customers and fuel suppliers. Harald believes this will help to increase the availability of green fuels and maximise operational efficiency. Harald concludes: ""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start.""
