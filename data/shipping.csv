Availability of low- and zero-carbon fuels, alternative bunkering infrastructure, the disregard of existing fuels and technologies, and safety topped the list of industry concerns that were voiced during London International Shipping Week (LISW) in mid-September.

One of those adding his voice to the chorus of the concerned was Columbia Group chief executive and president, Mark O’Neil. As lead executive for one of the largest shipmanagers in the world, Mr O’Neil said: “[The] runway for widespread adoption of alternative fuels is much longer and much narrower than anyone anticipated,” and urged the industry to slow down. Columbia Group manages more than 400 vessels, has 20 crewing agencies and more than 20,000 employees.

While his firm is committed to maritime decarbonisation, Mr O’Neil called for a reality check in adopting alternative fuels at LISW 2025, echoing sentiments expressed by ABS chairman and chief executive, Chris Wiernicki, earlier in the week.

Adding fuel to the fire is the Trump Administration, which has made it clear that it will not “tolerate any action that increases costs” for Americans. As a follow up to the US walkout during MEPC 83, a joint statement was issued by administration officials in August, serving as a shot across the bow to any IMO member voting for the framework.

“If alternative fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually”

“Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale,” it said.

The statement, issued by secretary of state Marco Rubio, secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, secretary of energy Chris Wright, and secretary of transportation Sean Duffy, also noted the regulation would “preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where US industry leads such as liquified natural gas and biofuels.”

Concluded the joint statement: “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail.”

Meanwhile, while admitting the fleet of alternative fuel-capable vessels is growing, Mr O’Neil said it “doesn’t mean those vessels are ready to burn alternative fuels.”

And, furthermore, he said, there was a question as to whether “the world is ready to invest considerable sums of money” to provide shipping with alternative fuels, given the current geopolitical tensions and “huge financial constraints throughout Europe”.

He said his company is “realistically ready” for the uptake of alternative fuels. “We don’t need thousands of crews in our crewing pool with alternative-fuel training,” he said, adding that “if alternative-fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually - and the majority of dual-fuel vessels or methanol- or ammonia-ready will probably never burn those alternative fuels.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/mark_oneil_columbia_groupwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:09.453897

Dr Teck Lim Chia, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, elaborated on the company’s diversification of its customer base, factors driving its biofuel sales to surge 154.7% year-on-year in 1H2025, plans on future marine fuels, and future investments:

MT: With sales volume increasing by almost 10%, which shipping industries have been most keen to work with CBL and why is this so?

The increase in sales volume was mainly driven by network expansion, new customer acquisitions, and expansion toward the non-container liner and biofuel segments.

CBL has been actively targeting new customers, including mid-tier shipowners and tankers.

This strategic effort has diversified our customer base beyond container liners to include bulk carriers and oil tankers.

We have been in the industry for long period of time and have weathered various market cycles alongside our clients, building mutual trust through shared experience.

We deliver professional one-stop services, including the bunkering of conventional fuels and biofuels, at reasonable pricing and excellent creditability. This is why we are expanding our customer base continuously, including container liners and non-container liners. Our customer concentration is also coming down continuously.

Shipping companies, which are biofuel early adopters, seeking to comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations have favored us. The surge in our biofuel sales indicates strong uptake from environmentally conscious carriers subject to IMO and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations.

MT: What factors in the market allowed CBL to introduce a triple-digit growth to its biofuels operation while narrowing net loss by 40% in 1H 2025?

On biofuel:

The implementation of IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations (effective January 2025) has accelerated demand for sustainable marine fuels. These regulations compel shipping companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face penalties, creating immediate market demand for biofuels.

CBL’s early certification (ISCC EU and ISCC Plus) positioned us as a early mover in the sustainable marine fuels space. The successful B24 biofuel deliveries in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and multiple ports in China, have demonstrated our ability to arrange for such services to meet the surging demand from our customers.

Leveraging its early move into sustainable fuels, CBL is expanding its biofuel supply chain and exploring LNG and methanol, positioning itself to capture growth while helping customers meet tightening decarbonization targets across Asia Pacific, Europe, and other key markets.

The carbon emission requirement is the key tune for shipping. As the FuelEU regulations have been implemented since 2025, we expect more ships will use renewable fuel. The marine fuel in the next five years will be very different from those we are using today. CBL is taking a leading approach to adopt the new fuel. The growth of the biofuel will continue, inline of the global demand. We will push CBL staying ahead of this.

On narrowing net loss:

The 38.8% improvement in our bottom line for the first half of 2025 reflects the results of the strategic efforts and resources we have invested over the past few years to expand our port network, grow our customer base, and develop our biofuel operations over the past years.

We are now beginning to reap the benefits of these investments. As a result, we achieved double-digit sales volume growth in both fiscal year 2024 and the first half of 2025. We successfully onboarded new customers and reduced our dependency on our top five clients. Notably, our biofuel segment has continued to deliver strong growth over the past 12 months.

In addition, in the first half of 2025, we streamlined our operations to enhance efficiency, resulting in a 17% reduction in operating expenses.

Going forward, we remain committed to identifying new investment opportunities to further expand our network, with a particular focus on the sustainable fuels segment. In fact, we have adopted a more strategic approach aimed at optimizing profitability.

MT: CBL newly shared an initiative to explore, and possibility include LNG and methanol in its marine fuels portfolio; why is the company doing this and what type of partners are CBL looking to cooperate with?

For us, the biofuel story is just the opening chapter. Right now, we’re deeply entrenched in scaling our biofuel operations.

We’ve got B24 rolling out successfully in key hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China, and the demand is surging. We’re talking about 155% revenue growth in this segment, just in the first half of the year. But we see this is only the foundation.

So, how are we preparing for what’s next? It’s a three-part strategy.

First, we’re building on our biofuel foundation. We’re not just selling a product; we’re building a certified, compliant supply chain. Our ISCC certifications are like our passport into the future fuel,—they give us and our customers the trust, and verification needed, to navigate through, strict regulations like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Second, we’re actively exploring the next generation of fuels. Biofuels are a fantastic drop-in solution for today, but we know the market is looking at LNG, methanol, ammonia and more.

We’re already in the early stages of building partnerships, and understanding the supply chains for these fuels. We’re positioning ourselves, to be the partner, that can guide our customers, through this entire journey. From traditional fuel to biofuels, and eventually to whatever the next big thing might be.

Finally, and most importantly, we’re building trust and reliability. This transition isn’t just about having the right product; it’s about having the operational expertise, the digital systems for tracking and compliance, and the financial flexibility to make it all work.

Our expanding network of over 65 ports isn’t just for today’s business—it’s the physical backbone, that will allow us to distribute these new sustainable fuels, whenever and wherever, our customers need them tomorrow.

We are also regularly exploring investments opportunities, into vertical and horizontal supply chain integration.

So, in short, we’re in the process of building a business that is agile, certified, and customer-focused—ready to pivot and scale when the technology and regulations evolve. We’re not just preparing for today’s transition; we’re preparing for tomorrow.

MT: In addition to decarbonisation, the maritime industry has also been adopting digitalisation practises. How has CBL adopted digitalisation into its business operations and what the benefits of doing so?Yes, the bunker trading sector is rapidly embracing digitalisation to enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance. Integrated platforms now offer end-to-end management of bunkering operations—from procurement and real-time pricing to emissions tracking and documentation. We have explored various software solutions available in the market, but none have been specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the bunkering facilitation industry. As a result, we began developing our own proprietary system about a year ago.

To date, we have successfully built a management system that supports our daily operations. Looking ahead, we are committed to further enhancing this platform by integrating artificial intelligence — including machine learning — to empower our sales team and management with faster, more informed decision-making capabilities.

CBL’s Digital Transformation Initiatives to integrate with AI:

Real-Time Order Tracking & Analytics:Implement advanced systems for live monitoring of fuel deliveries, quality assurance, and automated reporting, reducing operational delays and enhancing customer trust.

IT tools for Risk Management:Optimize credit risk assessment, cashflow forecast, fraud detection, and supply-demand matching, lowering financial exposures and improving margin stability.

Back-End System Upgrades:Modernize CRM platforms to streamline workflows, automate invoicing/payment processes, and centralize data for faster decision-making.

CBL’s digital adoption strengthens its competitive edge through agility, accuracy, and alignment with industry-wide shifts toward data-driven bunkering.

Further digitalisation will help companies to increase their operating efficiency and we believe that this will be a key determinant in tomorrow’s competitive landscape.

We are also exploring digital tools that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking and compliance reporting for EU ETS/IMO CII, aligning biofuel sales with customer decarbonisation goals.

MT: With cash balance of USD 5.43 million, what are CBL’s plans for this sum of money to support growth?

The majority of capital will be allocated to working capital, ensuring operational stability and supporting increased sales volume without liquidity constraints. A portion will also scale our B24 biofuel operations and secure an ISCC-certified supplier network to capitalize on demand driven by EU ETS, IMO CII, and FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Supported by substantial banking facilities, we maintain a strong liquidity position to meet current obligations and fund future growth. Furthermore, as a Nasdaq-listed company, we have access to capital markets to finance strategic initiatives, including potential mergers and acquisitions for vertical or horizontal integration within the sustainable fuels supply chain.

This disciplined capital allocation strategy reinforces both our immediate operational resilience and long-term strategic objectives, ensuring CBL remains agile and competitive in a dynamic market.

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Constantinos Capetanakis, Chair of IBIA and Bunker Director at Star Bulk, gave bunkering publication Manifold Times an update on the organisation’s growth, industry objectives, and expectations for the upcoming convention.

MT: How has IBIA membership diversification grown since our last interview?

Since the start of my term in March 2024, IBIA has aimed to open membership to more stakeholders. Membership has grown by over 10%; new members include shipowners from many countries including Greece and there has been interest from governmental associations and institutes seeking IBIA’s technical knowledge and expertise regarding the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other decision-making forums.

IBIA aims to represent everyone dealing directly or indirectly with maritime energy and fuels, as it is not an association for a specific sector like bunker suppliers or buyers.

MT: Which agendas and issues in bunkering will IBIA be trying to push for the last quarter of 2025 and for next year?

The primary focus for the last quarter of 2025 is IMO’s decision on the IMO Net-Zero Framework in October. IBIA’s main responsibility will be to make its full membership aware of the framework’s contents, both in theory and practice, by explaining what each party needs to do. We fully support IMO’s role and proposals.

This is crucial as it is a complicated issue as highlighted by IBIA’s Dr Edmund Hughes, former Head of Air Pollution and Energy Efficiency at the IMO, at a recent members’ meeting analysing the implications.

The second major event is the Hong Kong Convention, a significant event within the larger Hong Kong Maritime Week, which we aim for it to be very successful following previous successful IBIA conventions.

MT: IBIA has a plan to expand its influence beyond global regulator IMO; how is the progress on this agenda?

IBIA has established official relationships with world-renowned associations such as BIMCO, GCMD, MPA, Intertanko, and Intercargo, and these relationships are increasing.

Additionally, a European Regional Board has been established with the main objective of participating in discussions and being heard by port authorities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region, the European Union, and wherever decisions are being made.

The organisation is also expanding its impact in the Americas and Africa. In Asia, its impact in Singapore is growing, and there is a strategic focus on opening into China, which is why the convention is being held in Hong Kong.

MT: What can delegates attending the upcoming IBIA Annual Convention in Hong Kong expect to take away?

Delegates can expect a very high level of speakers, presentations, panels, and marine energy industry related issues to be discussed within the panels. The event will provide significant networking opportunities, fostering an increase in their network, in a professional environment. It will also allow for interaction with other events and people participating in the Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Note: Constantinos Capetanakis will be moderating ‘Session one: Leadership Discussion​’ where he will be in conversation with one of the industry’s most prominent shipowners. This one-on-one interview will explore strategic perspectives on the future of bunkering and shipping, insights into the evolving energy landscape, and reflections on the critical role of collaboration and leadership. The session offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from two influential voices shaping the direction of the maritime fuel sector.

Join the Conversation

With over 300 delegates expected, the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 is set to be a defining moment for the marine fuels industry. Registration is now open via the IBIA Annual Convention website.

The Singapore-flagged Golden Antares, a 7,999 dwt IMO type 2 methanol bunker tanker owned and operated by Singapore bunker supplier Golden Island Pte Ltd, arrived in Singapore Port on 7 August, learned Manifold Times.

The vessel on 23 July completed loading 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of ISCC EU-certified green methanol from Tianjin Vopak’s storage facility at Tianjin Port before embarking towards Singapore. The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas) was the supplier, while Mitsubishi Corporation was the trader for the cargo.

“Our bunker tanker will first undergo port formalities and have its mass flow meter (MFM) unit commissioned in Singapore,” Tomohiro Yamano, General Manager of the Marine Fuel Department at Golden Island, told the bunkering publication.

“After the above is done, it will discharge green methanol to the Stolthaven Terminal in Singapore port on 15 August while keeping a portion onboard for the acceptance test of our Mass Flow Meter (MFM) system to ensure it meets the requirements set by Technical Reference for Methanol Bunkering (TR129).”

As part of efforts to get the vessel to comply to TR129 in order to carry out methanol bunkering operations in Singapore, Mr Yamano also noted that Golden Island has installed safety equipment such as fixed gas detectors from Gastron and fixed thermal cameras from HIKvision on board Golden Antares.

TR129 was launched by the Maritime and Port of Singapore (MPA) and Enterprise Singapore, through the Singapore Standards Council, in March 2025 to provide a comprehensive framework for the safe and efficient use of methanol as an alternative fuel for bunkering operations. It sets out requirements for the safe handling, transfer, and measurement of methanol in bunkering operations.

The development signifies a milestone for Golden Island and the company’s commitment towards sustainability and improved safety arrangement.

All crew members have also successfully completed the Basic and Advanced Training for Handling of Methanol as Fuel for Maritime Personnel courses. The courses were taught by the Singapore Maritime Academy at Singapore Polytechnic, as part of the Maritime Energy Training Facility established by MPA in 2024 to train the maritime workforce to handle and operate vessels using clean marine fuels.

Since 2023, Golden Island has already been designing a methanol bunker tanker for use in Singapore waters.

“We have always believed that for short-term to mid-term decarbonisation targets, green methanol has always been one of the best options available for the shipping industry,” explained Mr Yamano.

“Methanol is liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, thus making it easier to handle and store compared to gaseous fuels. The material is biodegradable in water and has the potential to be a carbon-neutral marine fuel.

“We want to be ready and prepared, overcome potential obstacles and share our experiences and knowledge with all stakeholders. Hopefully, we can help to grow the green methanol ecosystem in Singapore, positioning Singapore as the leading green methanol bunkering hub.”

Towngas

Towngas is the first enterprise on the Chinese mainland to produce ISCC EU and ISCC PLUS-certified green methanol. The successful delivery to Golden Island demonstrates Towngas’s capability to meet the commitments with precision and reliability, noted a spokesperson.

“This achievement underscores the effectiveness of Towngas’s strategic investment in green methanol production,” he said.

“Towngas recognises the growing momentum of the green methanol market across the region and remains dedicated to developing low-carbon solutions that support the shipping industry’s decarbonisation objectives.”

Mitsubishi Corporation

Mitsubishi Corporation, the principal partner of Golden Island in Singapore, acted as a conventional and low carbon methanol supplier, logistic service provider and coordinator of supply chain for the project.

“Mitsubishi views this transaction and partnership as an important step in its methanol initiative to support the global decarbonization of the maritime sector,” stated a spokesman.

Stolthaven Terminal

“Receiving this parcel of green methanol into Stolthaven Singapore through the Golden Antares marks a significant milestone in our efforts to support the decarbonisation of marine fuels,” expressed Guy Bessant, President Stolthaven Terminals.

“As a global storage provider and key logistics partner, we are proud to provide the infrastructure and operational capabilities necessary to handle green methanol safely and efficiently. This delivery not only demonstrates our readiness to support growing demand, but also reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting the future of sustainable shipping in Singapore and beyond.”

Chris Chatterton, Maritime Advisor of Global Centre for Green Fuels (GCGF), believes ethanol should have a seat at the alternative bunker fuel table and he shares with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times why it deserves to be part of the conversation:

MT: Tell us a little about GCGF, when it started and its mission.

The Global Centre for Green Fuels, or GCGF, is a non-profit global think tank headquartered in Singapore. We were established in 2024 to accelerate the adoption of sustainable fuels across maritime, aviation, and land transport. Our work focuses on enabling real-world deployment of low-carbon solutions through data-driven policy, technical validation, and strategic industry collaboration. We help stakeholders – from regulators to shipowners – navigate decarbonisation challenges with practical, scalable fuel strategies.

MT: As its maritime advisor, why do you think ethanol should be considered as an additional maritime fuel?

Ethanol presents a pragmatic pathway to decarbonise shipping. It’s widely available globally, competitively priced, and can be used with existing methanol dual-fuel engine platforms – often with minor re-calibration. Importantly, ethanol offers very low lifecycle emissions, whether derived from crops, waste or lignocellulosic biomass. Ethanol’s clean combustion profile also helps reduce local air pollutants like SOx and PM (particulate matter). Given the urgency of the IMO’s 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation targets, ethanol stands out as an immediate, scalable, and practical solution.

MT: What’s the current status of the push on ethanol following the document submission, highlighting the use of ethanol as a marine fuel, from Brazil and IBIA at IMO MEPC 83?

That submission was a critical milestone. It called for three main actions: a) inclusion of ethanol in the GESAMP LCA Working Group for lifecycle assessment, b) a request for ISO to develop a marine fuel standard for ethanol, and c) updates to the IGF Code to reflect ethanol-specific safety and operational differences from methanol. The submission was well received and is now being processed through relevant sub-committees like CCC and MSC. GCGF is supporting this by coordinating technical input and promoting pilot demonstrations and engine testing.

MT: With lots of focus on LNG, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as part of the future marine fuel mix, why do you think there hasn’t been much talk on ethanol and what do you think needs to be done to ensure it is part of the alternative fuel pool?

The ethanol story in shipping is just now being told. Other fuels have had strong industry backing and early movers, whereas ethanol’s benefits – such as its wide availability and infrastructure compatibility – haven’t been highlighted enough for maritime use. What’s needed is greater awareness, technical standardisation, and real-world demonstrations. Ethanol can be bunkered through the same terminals and handled with very similar safety protocols as methanol. Singapore, being a global maritime hub, can play a pivotal role in advancing ethanol’s case through bunkering, pilots and green corridors.

What are the challenges to achieve widespread adoption of ethanol as a marine fuel in terms of production, fuel availability, safety, and long-term viability and how can they be overcome?

Global ethanol supply is already robust – almost 100M mtpa currently – mainly from the U.S., Brazil, Europe, and a growing number of producers in Asia. That’s enough to support near-term maritime demand. Safety-wise, ethanol is classified as a low-flashpoint fuel, similar to methanol, and requires careful handling – something the industry is already accustomed to. Long-term viability depends on sustainability certification, cost competitiveness, and standardisation – all areas GCGF is working to address. The potential is there – it just needs the right regulatory and commercial framework.

MT: As the IMO’s IGF Code already includes methyl/ethyl alcohols as marine fuel, are there specific advantages in using ethanol vs methanol? What are the specific risks of ethanol, compared with methanol?

While it’s true that ethanol has a low flashpoint similar to methanol and as addressed in the IMO IGF Code, it’s important to note that methanol’s flash point, already in use as a marine fuel, is slightly lower. So low flashpoint alone isn’t a disqualifier, it’s a characteristic that must be managed through proper standards and safety protocols. Importantly, ethanol has a significantly lower toxicity risk than methanol, making it safer for crew handling, spill and salvage scenarios.

Ethanol has lower energy density than fuel oil, but higher than methanol, which makes it slightly more efficient too. Therefore, what is needed is a robust, ethanol specific ISO standard that accounts for its unique properties such as water miscibility, energy content, and ignition characteristics. Importantly, ethanol also carries significantly lower toxicity risks than methanol, making it safer for crew handling and spill scenarios.

Interim IMO guidelines already acknowledge ethanol alongside methanol, and class societies have started aligning with these. But we still require marine-specific test protocols, safe handling/safety training, and OEM validation to close the gap and highlight the slight differences between methanol and ethanol as ship fuels. This is a key agenda item for us at GCGF in 2025–2026.

MT: Do engines and tanks on ships need to be modified to use ethanol? How easy or difficult is it to adopt ethanol as a marine fuel?

It’s surprisingly straightforward. Modern dual-fuel engines designed for methanol and electronically controlled – like the Wärtsilä W25, W32, the Everllence (MAN) LGI series and several WindGD models – can be re-calibrated to ethanol with minimal hardware changes. It’s mainly a software calibration and minimal adjustments in the fuel supply system. Several leading OEMs have confirmed this compatibility, and we’re now working with engine OEMs to initiate formal testing and trials. The real opportunity lies in making ships “alcohol-ready,” giving owners flexibility between methanol and ethanol based on cost, supply, and route-specific decarbonisation goals.

Additionally, technology is driving the ability to equalise energy storage on board with the inclusion of Sandwich Structured Cofferdams, enabling lower energy density fuels such as methyl/ethyl alcohols to be bunkered on a Fuel Oil energy-equivalent basis.

MT: With growing interest in cleaner fuels, what are the sustainable advantages of the production of ethanol?

Ethanol supports both climate and energy security goals. Today’s production combines regenerative and precision agriculture with advanced biorefining technologies, resulting in exceptionally low carbon intensity ethanol, on par with or better than many synthetic fuels. It’s also a liquid fuel, meaning it can readily leverage existing bunkering and storage infrastructure. On a macro level, ethanol production supports rural economies, energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependence, and creates a unified supply chain for land, sea, and air transport – as we’re already seeing in places like Brazil, India, and potentially Japan.

As informed, these ships, equipped with dual-fuel gas engines, mark a major step in the company’s decarbonisation plans.
The transition to bio-LNG will prevent the emission of around 80,300 tonnes of CO₂, reportedly equivalent to removing 153,500 cars from the roads or planting 160,650 trees.
This initiative enables the company to eliminate its carbon footprint on the Barcelona–Alcúdia–Ciutadella and Malaga–Melilla routes, achieving a positive carbon balance.

As informed, these ships, equipped with dual-fuel gas engines, mark a major step in the company’s decarbonisation plans. Baleària has procured 132 GWh of bio-LNG, enough to keep the three vessels sailing emissions-free until December 2025, representing about 13% of the LNG consumed by its entire gas-powered fleet in 2024.

The bio-LNG is derived from biomethane produced from livestock waste, which captures methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and converts it into renewable energy. The biomethane is then transformed into bio-LNG through Enagás’ regasification plants in Huelva, Barcelona, and Cartagena, using a pioneering conversion process that achieves greenhouse gas savings of more than 200% compared to fossil fuels.

Baleària’s CEO, Georges Bassoul, said the move represents “a real and verifiable step forward” in the company’s net-zero commitment, adding that past investments in dual-engine technology now allow the fleet to fully benefit from renewable fuels.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bal-bio-lng-e1759737807382.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:21.416365

These changes have been made possible by what was thought to be a rock-solid support from across the EU 27.
It is expected, by most IMO observers, that the two thirds majority vote necessary to pass the NZF will be achieved.
Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, believes that these pronouncements by both Ørbeck-Nilssen and Wiernicki are “highly cynical”.
They did the same when the IMO introduced low sulphur fuel, it is part of the lobbying process, and it reflects the powerful shipowners’ lobby at the IMO,” added Smith.","The EU presents a united face at the IMO, but the façade may be dropping as the reality of the Net Zero Framework draws closer and the fear mounts for some countries that they may not be able to exploit energy reserves.

EU member states have been considered key drivers of the NZF driving change at IMO and garnering support from other states concerned about climate change to move shipping’s transition at pace, when compared to much of the IMO regulatory moves. These changes have been made possible by what was thought to be a rock-solid support from across the EU 27.

Speaking at the Cypriot press conference at last month’s London International Shipping Week the Deputy Shipping Minister, Marina Hadjimanolis, flanked by the Permanent Secretary Dr Stelios Himonas and Cyprus’s IMO representative Christos Atalianis, cast doubt on the country’s support for the NZF.

In a move that is expected to anger other member states Hadjimanolis suggested that Cyprus could be swayed by arguments that seek to ease the limitations on LNG, with Himonas suggesting, “We have large reserves of LNG,” indicating this would be economically beneficial for the Mediterranean island state.

One source, who is a representative at the IMO, was scathing about the Cypriot view saying pointing out that any “amendments to the MARPOL agreement were discussed at MEPC 83 in April, that was their opportunity to make changes, any substantive change to now would be going against both Brussels and IMO’s procedure”.

A second source, close to one of the delegations backed that view, adding that, “the details will be discussed at the upcoming Extraordinary meeting, [scheduled to start on 14 October] any changes to the level of ambition should have taken place at the April meeting.”

With detailed discussions already under way and the process now at a watershed moment the stakes could not be higher, with the US already seen as a disruptor, having reportedly approached the Dutch delegation in the hope of breaking the EU consensus, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that other delegations have been or will be approached.

Though Hadjimanolis denies any approach to the Cypriot delegation to date.

It is expected, by most IMO observers, that the two thirds majority vote necessary to pass the NZF will be achieved. That, however, is not the end of the road, the regulations must then be ratified by the nation states in the following ten months, and that requires approval by states whose registries represent at least 50% of global tonnage.

According to one senior figure that could be as little as four flag states, including Panama, Marshall Islands, Liberia and Hong Kong registries alone would secure the necessary 50%.

Moreover, senior industry figures such as Chris Wiernicki CEO at ABS and DNV’s maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen have called for a change of course with Wiernicki stating, “LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success [of the NZF] and should not be overlooked, over penalized or discarded in the Net Zero regulation. Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard.”

While Ørbeck-Nilssen believes that LNG is a transitional fuel, that with the production of bio-LNG and e-LNG this could lead to the maritime industry “Beginning to swing towards using LNG as an alternative fuel”.

Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, believes that these pronouncements by both Ørbeck-Nilssen and Wiernicki are “highly cynical”.

“They are dog whistling. They did the same when the IMO introduced low sulphur fuel, it is part of the lobbying process, and it reflects the powerful shipowners’ lobby at the IMO,” added Smith.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/blt59fd977eca874ebc/66cdd45e67d71e29dd35764a/EU-flags.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:31.484658

A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions.

If approved by a two-thirds majority of IMO member states, the framework will create a roadmap for maritime decarbonization. In fact, the regulations will set precedent globally, being the first to combine mandatory emissions limits and a GHG pricing mechanism across an entire industry sector.

But even as this critical decision awaits confirmation, two sustainability researchers are demanding for a more nuanced discussion on why international shipping must be regulated.

Depending on who you ask, there are different justifications to subject shipping to environmental regulations. One of the most common reasons is that maritime industry plays an enormous role in the world economy, hence an important pressure point for global climate policy. To show the impact of shipping on the climate, statistics such as “cargo ships transport 90% of everything” have become commonplace. Based on this fact, some campaigners have recommended people to consume less, or even buy local, as it helps to bring down shipping demand, thus reducing GHG emissions.

Unfortunately, this narrative about maritime transport focuses on the highly unequal levels of consumption around the world, enabled by international shipping. In a new research paper for the journal Global Sustainability, Dr. Christiaan De Beukelaer (University of Melbourne) and Prof. Philip Steinberg (Durhan University), queries the commonly accepted numbers about maritime transport, which are often used to guide environmental campaigns.

“It’s often claimed that 90% of everything is transported by sea, but the reality is far more nuanced,” said Beukelaer. “While ships do indeed carry some 80-90 percent of international trade by weight, they only transport a bit over 10% of the global economy’s 100 billion tons of material footprint every year, as per International Resource Panel (IRP).”

The authors suggest that when dealing with environmental processes and impacts, relying on just the size and scale of systems could be problematic as starting points for policy arguments. The same applies to maritime transport. A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions. These include campaigns to shift to local production and consumption, which might not necessarily curb shipping emissions. Before a commodity is shipped internationally, a significant material footprint is usually incurred at the local level.

Globally, shipping contributes to 3% of greenhouse gas emissions. But despite being a large and important industry, most of the global economy’s annual material footprint is not traded internationally - by ship or other means.

“As part of the transition away from fossil fuels, oceans and waterways will need to be safe and reliable conduits for global trade, whether we think of shipping as representing 90% or 10.8% of everything,” the authors concluded.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Union-Pacific-coal-train-Wyoming-Wuzel007-CC-BY-SA-30.9d95ba.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:44.948195

“The use of bioLNG on our regular routes represents a real and verifiable step forward in our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions”, explains Georges Bassoul, CEO of Baleària.
First ferry company in Europe with ISCC certification Baleària has become the first ferry company in Europe to receive the ISCC EU (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification).
This is possible thanks to the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) system, which certifies their origin, volume and characteristics, including emissions savings.","Baleària is taking another step forward in its roadmap towards decarbonisation and has begun regularly incorporating bioLNG in its operations. The Margarita Salas, Abel Matutes and Rusadir vessels, which have dual gas engines, have been powered exclusively by this renewable fuel since the beginning of September. The company has procured 132 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of bioLNG, which will allow the three ships to sail emissions-free until December 2025. This volume, supplied over just four months, is equivalent to 13% of the LNG consumed by Baleària’s entire gas-powered fleet in 2024.

Thanks to this measure, Baleària is not only eliminating its carbon footprint on the Barcelona–Alcúdia–Ciutadella and Malaga–Melilla routes but is also generating a globally positive carbon balance. The use of this biofuel between September and December will prevent the emission of 80,300 tonnes of CO2, the annual equivalent of taking 153,500 cars off the roads or planting 160,650 trees.

Biomethane, produced from livestock waste, captures and recovers methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, transforming it into useful energy for shipping. The biomethane supplied is converted into bioLNG thanks to the pioneering conversion service at Enagás’ regasification plants, which is already up and running in Huelva, Barcelona and Cartagena. This process makes bioLNG a key energy solution: CO₂-neutral, with a negative carbon balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings of over 200% compared to traditional fossil fuels.

“The use of bioLNG on our regular routes represents a real and verifiable step forward in our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions”, explains Georges Bassoul, CEO of Baleària. “The investments in our fleet that we have made in recent years to equip it with dual engines allow us to use this renewable fuel, which prevents the release of greenhouse gases and accelerates decarbonisation.

It should be noted that in the first quarter of 2025, Baleària carried out the first bioLNG supply tests at Spanish port terminals, and back in 2021, it completed Europe’s first decarbonised voyage between Barcelona and Menorca.

First ferry company in Europe with ISCC certification

Baleària has become the first ferry company in Europe to receive the ISCC EU (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification). This standard international accreditation is recognised by both the European Commission and the international community, guaranteeing the traceability and sustainability of the biofuels and other renewable energies used by a company in its operations.

However, shipping moves around 80% of all global trade and is the most efficient form of commercial transport according to the International Chamber of Shipping. This industry cannot come to a halt without catastrophic consequences for global supply chains.

COP28 saw shipping CEOs come together to issue a joint declaration calling for an end date for fossil-only powered new builds and urging the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to create the regulatory conditions needed for the transition to green fuels.

Maritime trade volumes grew 2.4% in 2023 while global GDP rose 2.7%

Between 2025 and 2029, it predicts maritime trade will average +2.4% a year and containers +2.7%.

“We believe that a regulatory framework and clear targets are crucial to accelerating the introduction of alternative fuels and reducing our carbon footprint,” says Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd. “This commitment is in line with Hapag-Lloyd's goal of achieving a net zero carbon fleet by 2045 and reflects our industry's unwavering commitment to environmental responsibility.”

We are proud to be part of this unprecedented collaboration with our peers and it is only right that together we follow this path towards net zero that we must achieve by 2050.”

At the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s (MEPC) 83rd session in April 2025, the IMO approved a net zero framework that combines a fuel standard with a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for ships. The IMO hopes this will be adopted at a meeting from 14 to 17 October 2025 and enter into force from 2027.

Read the full feature in Issue 57 of Sustainability Magazine.

What is the IMO’s net zero framework?

The framework includes two key elements: a global fuel standard and global greenhouse gas emissions pricing mechanism. The fuel standard will require ships to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be and the pricing mechanism will contain set prices on the greenhouse gases ships emit to encourage the industry to lower emissions. The IMO is looking to apply a carbon price of US$100 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent.

This applies to all oceangoing ships with more than 5,000 gross tonnage as these ships are responsible for more than 85% of global shipping emissions and already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. The IMO says that while ships under 5,000 gross tonnage are not covered, discussions are underway to possibly include ships between 400 and 5,000 gross tonnage in the future.

IEA: How the shipping sector could save on energy costs

Shipping’s energy intensity fell by about 30% between 2008 and 2023

Without those gains, 2023 marine fuel demand would have been roughly 1.8 million barrels per day higher

That avoided demand equated to around US$60bn in fuel costs in 2023

Average commercial ship size is now more than 50% larger than in 2008

Average operating speeds fell by about 10% versus 2008 as slow steaming became standard practice.

Ship emissions are measured using greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) that calculates how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, expressed in gCO₂eq/MJ. This framework covers emissions from the entire fuel lifecycle and data must be independently certified through a Sustainable Fuel Certification Scheme recognised by the MEPC.

“We believe that a regulatory framework and clear targets are crucial to accelerating the introduction of alternative fuels and reducing our carbon footprint”

If a ship exceeds the set compliance thresholds, the deficit must be balanced by using surplus units transferred from other over-compliant ships or banked from previous years or remedial units acquired by paying into the IMO Net Zero Fund. If a ship switches to zero or near zero emissions fuels, it qualifies for financial rewards. Each ship’s compliance will be tracked through a new digital IMO GFI registry.

Positivity and pushback

The IMO’s framework has support. In January 2025, a joint submission to the IMO from 47 governments, including Greece, Japan, Korea and the UK, supported a greenhouse gas emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping.

In September, the Getting to Zero Coalition, with members including Iberdrola, BP, Unilever and Citigroup, issued a statement that says: “It is crucial that constructive negotiations continue and that negotiators agree on guidelines for implementation that can deliver on the IMO’s strategy. The foundation for success is there if the political will to adopt the framework in October and refine it over time remains firm.

“Within the industry, the work on the transition has begun. New vessels that can use alternative fuels are being ordered, and the supply chain for alternative fuels has recognised the shipping sector as an important new customer. In our view, a failure to adopt the framework risks significant negative consequences for this momentum.”

Results from the Fourth IMO Greenhouse Gas Study

Total shipping greenhouse gas emissions rose from 977 Mt in 2012 to 1,076 Mt in 2018 and CO₂ rose from 962 Mt to 1,056 Mt

Shipping’s share of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases increased from 2.76% to 2.89% between 2012 and 2018

Voyage-based international-shipping CO₂ rose from 701 Mt to 740 Mt between 2012 and 2018

Carbon intensity improved by 21% (AER) and 29% (EEOI) in 2018 versus 2008

Without stronger measures, total shipping emissions are projected to be 90 to 130% of 2008 levels by 2050.

Not everyone agrees. In late January 2025, a group of countries including Brazil, China and South Africa sent a letter to IMO warning of negative trade impacts from a universal GHG contribution.

In April 2025, the United States withdrew from the carbon pricing talks and urged others to follow. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement that US President Donald Trump’s administration will “not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people” and described the IMO’s framework as “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation”. “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail,” the statement concludes.

“Shipping is at the forefront of technological innovation when it comes to decarbonisation”

On the launch of the 2025 American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Sustainability Outlook, ABS CEO Christopher Wiernicki said that “shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories”. “There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support,” he said. “LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation. Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard.”

Hapag-Lloyd’s sustainability strategy

Hapag-Lloyd’s overarching sustainability goal is to reach net zero fleet operations by 2045.

“We have advanced our decarbonisation efforts by adding new, state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet, placing additional newbuild orders and accelerating our fleet upgrade programme,” says CEO Rolf Habben Jansen in its 2024 Sustainability Progress Report.

Hapag-Lloyd’s sustainability progress

Achieved an average annual efficiency ratio of 7.96 in 2024, down from 9.13 in 2022

Used about 195k tonnes of biofuel blends in 2024

Carried roughly 490,000 TEU of dangerous goods in 2024, detected 4,256 misdeclarations and achieved zero reportable incidents since 2020

Recycles vessels exclusively at EU-certified yards with four vessels recycled across 2023 and 2024.

The company’s Fleet Upgrade programme, launched in 2022, aims to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of its ships. It has also ordered 24 large container ships that will be built in China and equipped with “state-of-the-art, low-emission and fuel-efficient high-pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines”.

Rolf explains in the report: “Our sustainability journey continues. Building a just, safe and clean industry is an ongoing responsibility and requires continuous collaboration between industry stakeholders.”

Sustainability at Maersk

Maersk aims to reach net zero by 2040, and its strategy includes introducing the world’s first large dual-fuel methanol fleet. In December 2024 it completed an order of 20 dual-fuel owned vessels with a total capacity of 300,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

Maersk’s decarbonisation highlights

Seven large dual-fuel methanol vessels joined the fleet in 2024

A further 20 dual-fuel vessels were ordered for delivery between 2028 and 2030

Methanol offtake agreements now cover more than 50% of expected 2027 dual-fuel fleet demand

Achieved an EEOI of 11.1 gCO₂e per tonne-nautical-mile in 2024, down from 11.7 in 2023

Maersk Halifax became the industry’s first large container ship retrofitted to operate on methanol, lengthened by 15 metres to 368 metres and increased to about 15,690 TEU.

The company says that dual-fuel vessels are central to its decarbonisation plans, capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 65% to 90% through the use of bio- and e-methanol compared to conventional fossil fuels. Maersk also aims to deploy dual-fuel liquefied methane vessels, aiming to use bio- or e-methane as soon as possible.

“Let's get this done,” says Lene Bjørn Serpa, Director, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Maersk on LinkedIn. “We have the technology and the willingness - we just need the clear regulatory framework to accelerate the energy transition in the shipping industry.”

MSC’s sustainability impact

MSC says that it is committed to an energy transition targeting net zero decarbonisation by 2050 and is investing in a massive newbuilding programme and far-reaching retrofit plan.

By 2027, the company expects more than 100 dual-fuel newbuilds and already has many in service. These will allow for 20% of MSC’s fleet capacity in TEU to be transported by dual-fuel vessels, an increase from around 4% at the end of 2023.

We are committed to clean shipping, that is using based on credible science and practical solutions that work globally.","According to them, OSPAR has implemented regional restrictions on exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) without aligning with the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Moreover, most OSPAR member states did not conduct the environmental risk assessments recommended by the IMO, indicating that decisions were driven more by precaution than by science. Existing scientific studies demonstrating that scrubber discharges are safe were also overlooked. As a result, the Clean Shipping Alliance argues that these unilateral restrictions lack credible evidence, lead to regulatory fragmentation, and risk discouraging investment in clean technologies.

SAFETY4SEA: What is the Clean Shipping Alliance’s overall philosophy for the maritime industry, and what are your key priorities for the next five years?

The Clean Shipping Alliance (CSA) is driven by a commitment to supporting practical, science-based solutions that enable the maritime industry to reduce emissions today while supporting progress toward long-term decarbonization goals. Over the next few years, our priorities will include advocating for globally consistent regulations, promoting the role of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) as an effective transitional and enabling technology (including their critical role in carbon capture), and challenging restrictive initiatives that are based on speculative science or opinion. In short, we will aim to ensure that early adopters of clean technologies are supported, not penalized, and that credible science is the driving force behind any regulatory decisions.

S4S: Could you briefly outline your primary concerns regarding OSPAR’s recent decision to restrict the use of scrubbers in North Atlantic ports and inland waters?

We are concerned about this rush to regulate regionally without IMO and without a credible scientific basis. Our first concern is that OSPAR’s decision to orchestrate a regional restriction sets a questionable precedent by bypassing the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the globally recognized competent authority on marine emissions and EGCS guidelines. Also, although the IMO strongly recommends that authorities conduct an environmental risk assessment before initiating any EGCS restrictions, almost none of the Parties have done this. This indicates that the Parties agreed to initiate national restrictions for solely precautionary reasons, without the benefit of first-hand scientific investigations. We also note that while numerous peer-reviewed studies and real-world sampling show that scrubber discharge water meets stringent international water quality standards and poses negligible environmental risks, these haven’t appeared on the OSPAR reference list and apparently are not considered. By introducing unilateral regional restrictions without robust scientific evidence, OSPAR is further fragmenting global shipping regulations, and also risks undermining the investment confidence shipowners need to develop and implement new clean technologies.

S4S: What specific operational or economic impacts do you foresee for shipping companies as a result of these restrictions? Are there particular vessel types or regions that will be disproportionately affected?

Certainly those vessels homeported or heavily trading in the OSPAR region will be most affected.

S4S:Several European nations, including Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, have already implemented their own scrubber restrictions. How do these national measures complicate shipping operations, and do you expect this trend to accelerate following OSPAR’s decision?

First, the implementation of national-level restrictions creates a patchwork of rules that makes compliance increasingly challenging for global operators. Instead of a unified IMO framework, shipowners face a mosaic of local bans and limitations, leading to operational inefficiencies and additional fuel and logistic costs. One operational impact will be the requirement for vessels to change fuels prior to entering Danish, Swedish or Finnish territorial waters when enroute to a port in one of these countries. This at minimum is a distraction and a great inconvenience, especially for large ships in these high traffic environments, day and night, and in all weather conditions. Unfortunately, OSPAR’s decision may encourage others to consider similar measures, also only for precautionary reasons, as they may incorrectly assume that the OSPAR countries have done all the scientific investigations.

S4S:You’ve described OSPAR’s move as setting a “questionable precedent.” Could you elaborate on what you mean by that? Are you particularly concerned about regulatory fragmentation across regions?

We mean that when OSPAR acted outside of the established IMO framework, including without any clear evidence of pressing need, this undermines international cooperation and sets a dangerous example where one region’s opinion, science-based or not, can override international evidence-based policymaking – and further complicate the regulatory scene. One potential effect is the impact on shipowner confidence to invest in new green technologies, out of fear that the technology will be demonised in a few years. In the long term, this disrupts the adoption of innovative transitional green technologies by penalising early movers who are acting in good faith to decarbonize in line with legislation.

S4S: One of your key criticisms is the bypassing of the IMO process. Why do you believe the IMO remains the most appropriate and effective platform for regulating Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems at a global level?

The IMO has decades of experience developing scientifically robust, globally harmonized standards for marine environmental protection, including EGCS guidelines. Its approach ensures that regulations are based on extensive data, technical expertise, and broad stakeholder consultation. Global maritime shipping relies on consistency to operate efficiently and sustainably; bypassing the IMO erodes this foundation and introduces legal and commercial uncertainty. The IMO process also ensures that environmental objectives are met without unintended consequences that might arise from fragmented regional measures.

S4S: In your view, how should regional bodies like OSPAR coordinate with international organizations such as the IMO when it comes to developing environmental regulations?

Regional bodies should complement, not compete with, the IMO by contributing credible data, conducting local risk assessments, and sharing findings transparently. They should work through IMO mechanisms to propose amendments or new guidelines if evidence supports the need for change. This inclusive and collaborative approach maintains regulatory consistency, encourages innovation, and ensures that decisions are grounded in sound science rather than precautionary politics.

S4S: What would the CSA consider a scientifically credible process or framework for assessing the environmental risks of scrubber discharges? Are there best practices or examples you would point to?

A credible process would involve comprehensive environmental risk assessments, including methods that follow internationally recognized standards contained in the IMO MEPC guidelines. A number of studies are availbe to provide strong examples of best practices, transparent standard methods, conservative assumptions, and multi-species ecotoxicity testing. All current EGCS restrictions in ports or even port states that we know of are based on some form of the “precautionary principle”, which was originally designed to allow a protective position until the science was available to make a proper evaluation. Today, the science for EGCS is available, the IMO has published guidelines on risk assessments, and these can be done affordably using local waters and the assistance of reputable local/national technical experts.

S4S: With growing pressure on the shipping industry to decarbonize and reduce environmental impacts, how does CSA balance its advocacy for scrubber use with broader environmental responsibilities?

CSA is an industry advocate and technical forum for promoting good environmental practices, environmental systems technical research and development, and sound scientific practice in testing and analysis of environmental system performance. This includes ongoing strong support for the use of only standard, generally accepted scientific methods and protocols for all air/water emissions testing and measurements.

S4S: What is your ‘wish list’ for the industry, regulators, and other stakeholders when it comes to addressing the critical challenge of maritime decarbonization?

First, we need global regulatory consistency and predictability to encourage investment in clean technologies. Second, scientific rigor must be at the heart of every environmental regulation to ensure real-world benefits. Third, we urge closer collaboration across industry, regulators, and academia to accelerate practical decarbonization pathways that are affordable, scalable, and effective.

S4S: If you could change one thing in the shipping industry from your perspective, what would it be, and why?

We would change the tendency to rush to precautionary restrictions without adequate scientific evidence. This undermines trust, creates unnecessary operational complexity, and ultimately hinders meaningful environmental progress. If decisions were consistently rooted in sound science and global cooperation, we could achieve faster, more impactful emissions reductions while maintaining a fair and efficient market.

S4S: What message would you like to share with policymakers, environmental groups, and the public regarding CSA’s role in promoting both clean shipping and scientifically sound regulation?

Our message is simple. We are committed to clean shipping, that is using based on credible science and practical solutions that work globally. Scrubber technology has helped the industry reduce sulphur and particulate emissions significantly in international operations, as intended without any harm to the environment, and will continue to play a key role in future innovations like carbon capture. We call on policymakers to engage openly, expertly examine the full, robust body of scientific evidence, conduct your own assessments, and work collaboratively to shape fair and effective regulations.
