This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions.","The maritime industry is at the beginning of a major trans- formation. Driven by a continuously evolving regulatory environment, intensifying commercial pressure, and a gen- eral global shift towards reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the transition to net zero is taking shape.

In this context, the Net-Zero Guide (the Guide) provides a structured, practical framework to support shipowners, operators, and managers in developing cost-effective com- pliance strategies while maintaining long-term resilience. The Guide focuses on actionable measures to align fleet operations, investments, and value-chain partnerships with evolving regulatory and market expectations.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and regional bodies such as the European Union (EU) have introduced ambitious decarbonization targets, including net-zero emissions by 2050. This is being underpinned by regulatory frameworks, which are reshaping the industry’s strategic pri- orities. This is currently most prominent in the EU, where the Emissions Trading System (ETS) was extended to shipping in 2024, and the FuelEU Maritime regulation implemented in 2025, promoting the use of low-GHG fuels.

The IMO is attempting to introduce similar legislation on a global scale through the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). While this was approved by members in April 2025, an extraordi- nary session of the IMO’s MEPC in October 2025 decided to delay its adoption by adjourning the meeting for one year. As a result, the earliest potential entry into force is now 1 March 2028.

Maritime decarbonization is being propelled by other influential forces, including pressure from financial institu- tions, expectations from cargo owners, and the growing importance of corporate ESG commitments. While these forces work in different ways, they all make environmental performance a critical determinant for securing access to capital, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring long- term commercial viability.

Given the ongoing fragmentation and rapid evolution of regulatory and commercial frameworks, compliance require- ments are becoming increasingly complex and costly. This

is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized en- terprises (SMEs), which must navigate overlapping require- ments across jurisdictions and develop holistic strategies that integrate technology adaptation, value-chain transfor- mation, and responsiveness to shifting market dynamics.

As these demands intensify, shipping companies must shift from reactive compliance to proactive transformation. This means developing strategies where regulatory alignment, strategic innovation, and operational performance advance in parallel.

A phased approach to fleet decarbonization is essen- tial, and shipping companies should develop a strategic approach across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The Guide recommends a three-step framework to help shipping companies translate decarbonization objectives into executable actions across their fleets:

1.Assessment

•Conduct a detailed evaluation of the fleet’s current emissions profile, benchmarking vessel performance against applicable decarbonization frameworks.

•Identify exposure to regulatory requirements across short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

•Determine technical and operational gaps, assessing where efficiency upgrades, fuel transitions, or process improvements are required.

2.Strategic planning

•Develop a fleet-wide decarbonization roadmap that integrates operational measures and technical upgrades within a unified planning horizon.

•Prioritize operational measures such as speed optimization, weather routing, and trim and ballast management to deliver near-term efficiency gains.

•Plan technical upgrades – including energy-saving devices, hull coatings, engine retrofits, and alternative-fuel readiness – through a structured cost-benefit assessment.

•Align fleet renewal and retrofit plans with technology readiness, shipyard availability, and regulatory milestones to avoid stranded assets.

3.Implementation and monitoring

•Execute identified measures through a phased programme supported by clear timelines, key performance indicators, and governance structures.

•Employ digital tools and fleet performance monitoring systems to track fuel consumption, emissions, and compliance status in real time.

•Institutionalize a continuous feedback process to refine strategies as regulations and technologies evolve.

The assessment stage establishes a factual baseline and en- ables companies to prioritize resources effectively, ensuring regulatory compliance and informed decisions. Translating this to a robust strategic plan positions companies to meet compliance milestones while preserving commercial flexi- bility and investment efficiency. Once these strategies are executed, embedding data-driven monitoring and adaptive governance enables shipping companies to maintain align- ment with dynamic regulatory environments while building internal capability and resilience.

But decarbonization extends beyond technology, and organizational transformation across the value chain is equally important for the implementation of new technolo- gies and systems.

To manage this transition in an optimal way, maintain safety, and ensure readiness for emerging regulatory frameworks, a structural approach incorporating effective change man- agement and capacity building is key, allowing companies to balance short-term operational efficiency with long-term decarbonization readiness. Marrying this with an effective operational strategy ensures compliance, enhances prof- itability, and prepares companies for future low- and zero- carbon operations.

The Guide proposes an organizational roadmap, in three key domains, which can incorporate all of these elements, ensuring long-term compliance and competitiveness:

1.Fleet renewal and retrofit strategy

•Pursue a dual-pathway approach that combines newbuild programmes incorporating zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuel systems with targeted retrofits to extend the operational life of existing assets.

•Engage early with shipyards, designers, and technology suppliers to ensure vessel designs are fuel-ready, accommodating methanol, ammonia or hydrogen systems as infrastructure matures.

•Implement retrofitting programmes to upgrade propulsion systems, install energy-saving devices, and integrate digital monitoring capabilities.

•Coordinate fleet renewal with regulatory checkpoints (2030–2040–2050) and evolving market signals to optimize capital deployment and minimize stranded- asset risk.

2.Fleet operational strategy to net zero

•Optimize vessel operations across the fleet through data- driven voyage planning, fuel management, and emissions monitoring.

•Deploy operational optimization techniques – such as slow steaming, weather routing, port call optimization, and trim and draft optimization – to deliver measurable efficiency gains.

•Adopt phased fuel transition strategies, beginning with drop-in biofuels and progressing to ZNZ fuels such

as green methanol, ammonia, or hydrogen, based on infrastructure readiness.

•Leverage digital platforms for real-time performance tracking and integration of environmental metrics into commercial decisions.

3.Manage change to overcome implementation challenges

•Apply structured Management of Change (MoC) frameworks to address the organizational, technical, and safety implications of adopting new fuels and technologies.

•Strengthen cross-departmental coordination between technical, commercial, and operational teams to ensure consistent implementation of decarbonization measures.

•Invest in crew and shore-based competence development, particularly in fuel handling, safety, and digital systems operation.

•Embed digitalization and cybersecurity as core enablers of compliance, ensuring data integrity and transparency across reporting and performance systems.

To complement internal efforts, external facing practices are equally essential. This should include alignment with external stakeholders across regulatory bodies, commercial partners, and the broader value chain, helping stakeholders to scale decarbonization efforts and unlock commercial value.

Shipping executives should focus on the following strategic priorities, integrating technical, operational, and commer- cial perspectives:

•Embed decarbonization into core business strategy, linking compliance objectives with fleet investment, financing, and chartering models.

•Adopt a lifecycle perspective on fleet management, balancing renewal, retrofit, and operational optimization within a unified investment framework.

•Leverage partnerships across the value chain – including fuel suppliers, ports, financiers, and technology providers – to accelerate innovation and manage risk.

•Invest in digitalization and data governance to enhance performance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term operational efficiency.

•Build organizational capability through structured competence development and robust change management processes that support sustainable growth.

With the regulatory and market environment evolving rapidly, shipping companies must adopt a dynamic, iterative approach to strategic planning. Advances in fuels, propul- sion systems, energy-efficiency technologies, and digitalization continue to unlock new opportunities for emissions

reduction and operational performance. To stay aligned with shifting conditions, structured review cycles, supported by robust data frameworks and performance indicators, are essential for validating strategy effectiveness. Ongoing engagement in policy development and industry forums will help ensure companies remain responsive to future regulatory thresholds and market expectations.

Strategic navigation toward net zero

The decarbonization of global shipping is both a regulatory necessity and a strategic opportunity. Companies that act early – combining robust compliance frameworks with innovation, operational excellence, and collaborative value-chain engagement – will not only meet emerging net-zero requirements but also secure long-term competitiveness in a rapidly transforming maritime economy.

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions. By integrating internal best practices with external part- nerships and continuous review, companies can build resilience, unlock commercial opportunities, and lead the maritime sector’s green transformation.

The journey to net zero will be more than a regulatory obligation – it is a strategic opportunity to redefine maritime operations for a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-12-28 17:57:06.430603

The ship, Höegh Australis, is powered almost entirely by liquefied natural gas, making it the first LNG-fuelled vessel ever to dock at an East African port. Its arrival marked a technical milestone for Kenya Ports Authority and a symbolic moment for a region whose trade arteries have long depended on some of the world’s most carbon-intensive fuels.

The Höegh Australis is a roll-on, roll-off vehicle carrier measuring 200 meters in length and nearly 38 metres across, with space for more than 9,300 vehicles spread over 16 decks. On this call, it discharged 824 vehicles and accessories destined for Kenya and neighboring landlocked markets that rely on Mombasa as their primary maritime gateway, including Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The scale of the vessel alone would be notable in any port. That it arrived running on 98 per cent LNG, using conventional bunker fuel only during engine start-up and limited manoeuvres, is what set this visit apart.

LNG-powered ships require different handling protocols, specialized safety procedures and crews familiar with advanced navigation and propulsion systems. The successful berthing demonstrated that Mombasa can meet these demands, an important signal to global shipping lines assessing which African ports are ready for the next phase of maritime transport.

International shipping is under pressure to change; The sector accounts for roughly three per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Maritime Organisation, and new IMO regulations require deep cuts in sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Heavy fuel oil, the industry’s traditional mainstay, is among the dirtiest fuels in commercial use.

LNG does not eliminate emissions, but it reduces sulphur oxides and particulate matter almost entirely, cuts nitrogen oxides by up to 85 per cent and lowers carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 20 per cent compared to conventional marine fuels. For port cities such as Mombasa, Lagos and Durban, where shipping emissions mix with urban pollution, these reductions translate directly into cleaner air.

Globally, more than 1,200 LNG-capable vessels are now in operation or on order, a number that has more than doubled over the past five years. African ports, however, have lagged in accommodating them. South Africa’s Durban and Ngqura ports have invested in shore-side efficiency and cleaner equipment but have yet to see regular LNG vessel calls.

In West Africa, Nigeria has explored LNG bunkering given its gas reserves, yet infrastructure development has been slow. North African ports such as Tangier Med have moved faster on efficiency and automation, but LNG adoption remains limited. Against this backdrop, Mombasa’s ability to receive Höegh Australis places it among a small group of African ports demonstrating readiness for lower-emission shipping.

The ship itself reflects how the industry is hedging its future. Built just a year ago, Höegh Australis is designed to be ammonia-ready, meaning it can be converted to run on zero-carbon fuels once safety standards, supply chains and port infrastructure catch up.

Ammonia-fuelled vessels have begun limited service in parts of Asia and Europe, but costs remain high and global bunkering networks are fragmented. For now, LNG serves as a bridge fuel, allowing shipping companies to meet tightening regulations while buying time for truly carbon-free options to mature.

For Kenya, the implications extend beyond environmental credentials. The Port of Mombasa handles more than 30 million tonnes of cargo annually and supports trade flows worth billions of dollars across East and Central Africa. Shipping efficiency affects everything from vehicle prices in Kampala to food costs in Kigali.

LNG-powered vessels are typically newer, larger and more fuel-efficient, enabling carriers to move more cargo per voyage at lower operating costs. Over time, this can translate into more competitive freight rates and more reliable services for African importers and exporters.

Kenya Ports Authority has framed the call within its Green Port Policy, which aligns with national clean energy objectives and Kenya’s broader climate commitments. In recent years, KPA has invested in electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes, energy-efficient lighting and digital traffic management to reduce congestion and emissions within the port.

According to KPA data, operational efficiency improvements have already cut vessel waiting times by more than 30 per cent over the past decade, reducing fuel burn at anchorage. Accommodating LNG vessels builds on these gains, shifting part of the emissions reduction upstream to the ships themselves.

Across Africa, ports are grappling with how to modernise under fiscal constraints while trade volumes continue to grow. The African Development Bank estimates that the continent needs more than $100 billion in port and logistics investment over the next decade to keep pace with demand. Sustainability is no longer a side consideration in that calculus.

European and Asian markets are beginning to factor shipping emissions into procurement decisions, and cargo owners are under pressure to decarbonise their supply chains. Ports that cannot service cleaner vessels risk being bypassed.

The arrival of Höegh Australis does not resolve these challenges, nor does it place Mombasa at the forefront of zero-carbon shipping. What it does show is that parts of Africa’s maritime system are beginning to adapt in step with global change rather than after it.

As LNG vessels become more common and alternative fuels edge closer to viability, the question for African ports will be how quickly isolated milestones become routine practice. On a quiet December morning in Mombasa, that transition moved from theory to steel, fuel lines and a ship safely alongside the quay.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-27-122541.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:27.366143

The research draws on contributions from national institutions such as the Agence Nationale des Ports, Tanger Med Special Agency, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen), and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), alongside international partners including PROBLUE and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility. Together, these actors explore how Morocco’s ports can evolve from traditional trade gateways into engines of a new clean-energy economy.

Why Shipping and Hydrogen Are Changing Everything

International shipping is under growing pressure to cut emissions. Responsible for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gases, the sector is now subject to firm climate rules set by the International Maritime Organization, which aims for net-zero emissions by or around 2050. In parallel, the European Union has extended its carbon market to shipping and introduced fuel rules that favor low-carbon alternatives. These policies are expected to make fossil fuels steadily more expensive while pushing shipowners toward new fuels. Green hydrogen, converted into ammonia or methanol, is widely seen as one of the few viable options to decarbonize long-distance shipping, as well as other hard-to-abate sectors such as fertilizers, steel, and aviation.

Morocco’s Natural Advantage in Green Hydrogen

The report argues that Morocco is exceptionally well placed to benefit from this shift. Its strong solar and wind resources allow it to produce renewable electricity at very low cost, which is the main driver of green hydrogen prices. Morocco is also close to Europe, which is expected to become the world’s largest importer of green hydrogen, and it has a long coastline with multiple ports open to global trade. These factors together give Morocco a structural advantage over many competitors. However, the study stresses that cheap production alone is not enough. The success of green hydrogen depends on the full value chain, including storage, transport, port handling, and reliable demand from ships and industry.

Four Ports, Four Different Strengths

To understand how this value chain could work in practice, the report assesses four port locations. Tanger Med, at the Strait of Gibraltar, stands out as Morocco’s main bunkering hub. Its position on major shipping routes means it can supply green fuels not only to ships calling at the port, but also to vessels passing through the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors. However, limited space makes large-scale hydrogen production there difficult. Mohammedia, near Casablanca, has a different advantage: nearby salt caverns that could be used for low-cost hydrogen storage, helping stabilize supply across the system. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco’s largest industrial port, already handles large volumes of ammonia and is closely linked to fertilizer and steel production, making it ideal for domestic hydrogen use. Tan-Tan, in southern Morocco, emerges as the most promising production site thanks to excellent renewable resources and available land, even though it would require major new investments and skills development.

A Connected System and the Role of Policy

Rather than developing each port in isolation, the report proposes an integrated “Lighthouse Scenario.” In this vision, green hydrogen would be produced at scale near Tan-Tan, transported by pipeline to Mohammedia for storage, distributed to Jorf Lasfar for industry, and supplied to Tanger Med for ship bunkering and exports. This coordinated approach could significantly reduce costs compared to fragmented development. Still, green fuels remain much more expensive than fossil fuels today. Closing this gap will require strong policy support, including international carbon pricing, clear national safety rules, shared infrastructure, concessional finance, and early pilot projects such as a green bunkering trial at Tanger Med.

Gateway to Green Energy presents Morocco’s ports as more than logistical assets. With the right coordination and regulation, they could become strategic hubs linking renewable energy, global trade, and industrial transformation, allowing Morocco to turn climate action into long-term economic opportunity.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/24_12_2025_10_03_33_5222196.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-12-28 00:12:09.950381
