(Al Persicke / The Reveille) U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Gov. Jeff Landry were among the participants at a vigil LSU held Friday evening for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. 
The event was organized by the LSU chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization Kirk founded and built into an immense political force. 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students. 
“I think Charlie Kirk contributed more positive contributions to the free marketplace of ideas than anyone in his generation, and probably in many generations,” Johnson said about Kirk, who he described as a close friend. 
Utah Valley University was Kirk’s first stop on what was meant to be a multi-state debating tour that included a stop at LSU on Oct. 27. 
Kirk was shot within minutes of the event starting. His death sparked immediate condemnations of political violence from across the political spectrum, as well as some further polarizing statements from both far-right and far-left corners. 
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on X in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting. 
Kirk’s killing also prompted political figures and universities to rethink security measures for public events. LSU’s vigil required security screenings and was staffed by dozens of law enforcement officers from Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office, the Baton Rouge Police Department and the LSU Police Department. 
A suspect in Kirk’s death was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense in Utah. Authorities say they intend to pursue the death penalty for 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Little is known about his motivations. 
Savannah Harrison, a Landry aide and former president of LSU’s Turning Point chapter, held back tears while speaking about the impact Kirk had on her life. 
“I was the girl ripping Trump hats off of my classmates’ heads. But through Charlie’s influence, I went from doing that to proudly wearing my own,” Harrison said. “I … embraced the values that still ground me today – God, family, country, and, as Charlie would say, in that order.” 
LSU announced Friday it would launch a lecture series promoting civil engagement and diverse viewpoints in Kirk’s memory. The LSU Foundation is seeking donations to support the series. 
“In the wake of the assassination of American political activist and media personality Charlie Kirk, LSU seeks to be the first university in the country to tangibly re-assert its commitment to civil discourse and freedom of speech,” LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and interim President Matt Lee said in a joint statement. “LSU has a long history of visible support for free speech … We are therefore well-positioned to take leadership on this front.” 
Lee said he hoped donations would soon come in to support the lecture series but did not know when it would start. 
Some conservatives have sought retribution against those who celebrated Kirk’s death. The Louisiana Republican Party issued a news release highlighting an LSU student who allegedly posted on social media “World famous fascist Charlie Kirk is dead. Rejoice,” and called on the university to take action against the student. 
Ballard said that while he is sad a student feels that way, they have a right to free speech.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of an expected run for governor, former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is asking the state’s campaign finance regulator to exempt him from a law that requires he disclose who is renting apartments in several Anchorage buildings he owns.
Treg Taylor and his wife Jodi Taylor own the Inlet View Tower in Anchorage as well as two other apartment complexes in South Anchorage and near Midtown.
Under state law, public officials must file an annual financial disclosure form that lists the sources of their income, including rental income, if it is above $1,000. The Alaska Public Offices Commission, which collects and publishes that information, can waive the requirement that a public official provide the identities of his or her renters.
Taylor filed a request for an exemption in March, but that request came after the deadline to submit his 2024 disclosure form.
The Public Offices Commission is perennially underfunded and understaffed, and its electronic submission process doesn’t work properly with rental income, according to a staff report. 
Only 15 out of roughly 1,200 filers have rental income, commission staff said in a written report, and of those 15, only four have more than 20 tenants. The Taylors claim to have 234 renters. 
In a Wednesday hearing, Jodi Taylor asked commissioners to grant the Taylors the waiver, saying that people have tried to talk to their tenants about them.
“I felt like, in this case, people are trolling,” Jodi Taylor said.
She said one of her employees had been threatened with a gun, and that she believed disclosure could pose a safety risk.
Treg Taylor did not participate in the hearing on Wednesday.
Commissioners, who have not yet ruled on the request for a waiver, appeared skeptical of Jodi Taylor’s arguments.
Heather Hebdon, director of the commission, said there was “no legal justification” to exempt disclosure and that there was a substantial public interest in the information.
“The purposes of public official financial disclosures in part are to assure that public officials and their official acts are free from the influence of undisclosed business interests and to allow the public to have access to the information necessary to judge the public officials’ credentials or performance in office,” she said.
Taylor resigned as Alaska Attorney General last month, a position he held since 2021. His last day in office was Aug. 29, and his public appearances both before and after his resignation resemble those of currently registered candidates for the 2026 governor’s race.

Sfraga announced the federal decision in a campus-wide email on Thursday.

Sfraga said the funding cut for UAF is estimated at $2.9 million, and the full effects are still under review. More than 20%, or an estimated 1,450 students at UAF are Indigenous, Sfraga noted. 
The full extent of the grant funding freeze across the University of Alaska system is still being analyzed, said Jonathon Taylor, UA director of public affairs, by email on Friday.
UA President Pat Pitney said in an emailed statement on Friday that the university will continue to create a welcoming environment for all students. 
“We are evaluating the impact these changes will have on our services to Alaska Native students, and are communicating directly with students, staff, and faculty who may be affected,” Pitney said. “A significant part of UA’s identity is our commitment to Alaska Native culture, language, art, heritage, business, and tribal management and governance; that remains unchanged. We proudly embrace our global leadership in Alaska Native and Indigenous studies, and will continue to sustain a welcoming environment where all – including our Alaska Native and Indigenous students – can thrive and succeed.”
Taylor said the University of Alaska Southeast has at least one grant-funded program on the Sitka campus aimed at improving student services, and university officials are waiting to hear whether it will be eliminated. Taylor said the University of Alaska Anchorage does not have any programs funded by this federal grant.
As of fall 2024, there were 3,254 students enrolled at the University of Alaska that identified as Alaska Native or American Indian, and 266 that identified as Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander, according to the university, and 19,629 students total across the UA system. 
The University of Alaska announcements came after the Trump administration said Wednesday it will withhold an estimated $350 million of congressionally-approved funding for minority serving colleges and universities, saying the money will be allocated elsewhere. The measure continues President Donald Trump’s initiative to eliminate programs that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Sfraga said the federal government is allowing up to a year to close out the programs. UAF has multiple grants which fall under the program, Sfraga said, and most are under the College of Indigenous Studies and the UAF Community and Technical College.
Sfraga said the grant program does not fund student aid, but it does support degree programs and support services like student advising and recruiting, workforce development and student success initiatives across campuses. 
University officials report that to date, the Trump administration has cancelled $6.6 million in research grants and almost $45 million has been frozen.
Each year, the university receives an estimated $250 million in federal research funds, Taylor said, adding that “95% of the university’s broad research portfolio remains intact. UA has experienced only minor disruptions as a result of the rapidly shifting policy picture in Washington, D.C., and we are closely monitoring developments as they evolve.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC09160-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 20:56:50.709425

Jim Pillen’s announcement last month that Nebraska is bringing a federal immigration detention facility to town.

Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they’ve heard other other area merchants describe similar commercial declines. Some Latinos they know have uprooted from southwest Nebraska, spurred by what the couple believes is fear and uneasiness over an increased ICE presence.
“And it’s not even open yet,” said Miguel Camacho, of the facility branded the “Cornhusker Clink” by federal officials. “Of all the 50 states, why here?”
‘People want to know’
Comments the Camachos made this week from their Carniceria — a few miles from where a state prison that holds up to 200 beds is being converted into a 300-bed ICE jail — reflected the sentiment of dozens who spoke against the project during a Friday hearing at the Capitol so full it required an overflow area.
The meeting was hosted by the Legislature’s Urban Affairs Committee. Chairman Terrell McKinney of Omaha offered the space after the chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee declined to hold a public hearing, calling the request premature.
McKinney, a member of both committees, said that while he had been offered a private briefing by the Pillen administration, he opted for a broader discussion open to the public.

He and other committee members said they were concerned about scant information shared about the state-federal plan to repurpose the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into an ICE detention center for migrants. The state is still trying to relocate the camp’s remaining 155 inmates to different state prisons. Officials said they expect to start housing federal detainees in October.
“Our people want to know, and they’re asking,” said State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also sits on both committees. 
“What happens is that when there’s no information provided, negativity and misinformation run rampant,” said State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, the lone Republican committee member who attended the hearing.
On Friday afternoon, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services issued a statement saying that Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys had spoken Thursday with McCook Mayor Linda Taylor and City Manager Nate Schneider about public safety and community impact.
Among the answers Corrections said it provided:

The converted ICE detention center will house an adult population with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies. 
Up to 65 staff positions will be added, all state positions, including additional medical personnel.
The state is exploring options for electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees.
A perimeter fence and intruder petition system will be added, as well as armed patrols around the perimeter.

A formal contract between Nebraska and the federal government is still being hammered out, Correctional Services officials said. 
 Four hours of testimony 

At the four-hour Urban Affairs hearing, about 40 people testified, none in support of the prison conversion that many worry could exacerbate state prison crowding elsewhere to accommodate the feds’ deportation push. 
Many said they were embarrassed. Some choked back tears. Others said they were angry to learn in news reports that the state had invited the Trump administration to consider Nebraska for such a facility.
Nebraskans packed a hearing on a plan to convert a Nebraska prison into an ICE jail. More than three dozen Nebraskans who could not fit into the room waited outside. The front row was reserved for Gov. Jim Pillen staff, which declined to attend, saying the committee lacked jurisdiction to examine the topic. Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Not present were members of the Pillen administration, which told the committee in a Thursday letter it would not participate, arguing that the the Judiciary Committee and not the Urban Affairs Committee had the legal jurisdiction and oversight authority to examine the issues at hand. Pillen’s staff did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
McKinney said he plans to ask the Judiciary Committee chair once again to hold a public hearing that he hopes Pillen’s staff would attend. 
Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s policy research director, wrote in the Thursday’s letter that McKinney had wrongly suggested that the future migrant population at the center would trigger an overcrowding of the correctional system. Zoeller wrote that an emergency declaration is required when the prison population systemwide is over 140% of operational capacity. He said the average now is about 115%.
“We have flexibility within our current corrections facilities to accommodate this new mission,” Zoeller wrote.
Spike Eickholt, representing ACLU Nebraska, said Nebraska leaders for a decade have debated what to do about state prison crowding. Currently, Nebraska is building a new $310 million-plus prison in Lincoln.
“Why are we committing to an investment of a new prison while giving up a current one?” he asked.
Other speakers lamented the loss of the Work Ethic Camp’s rehabilitative focus and programming aimed at transitioning criminal offenders for successful re-entry into society.
 Nebraska’s role in deportation

But most of Friday’s testimony centered on Nebraska’s role in Trump’s push for mass deportations. Pillen has said he is proud to be part of the president’s effort to “make sure we keep our community safe.”
“This stuff hits close to home and hits every corner of this state an country,” the governor has said.

“Are we willing to risk that and be made a joke nationally as the ‘Cornhusker Clink’ — for money that we may or may not get — and that breaks all values of Nebraska?” she asked.
Guillermo Enrique Peña Valladares of Grand Island said he comes from a family of immigrants and that federal enforcement tactics have created anxiety and intimidation even among those legally in the country for generations.
“Should I fear saying my name?” he asked, voice cracking. He said his family works in meatpacking plants and his mom speaks broken English. “Every day we have to ask ourselves, ‘Are we going to be alright?’”
As his family’s first college graduate, Peña said, he felt a responsibility to speak out.
“You are trying to imprison the agricultural hands of Nebraska. They are already battered and bruised,” he said.
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said a worry is the “lack of planning” and demeaning behavior by ICE toward migrants.
She said her nonprofit saw it first hand, representing several of the 78 workers detained in the June 10 immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods. Wurth described, for example, the early 48 hours when some families did not know where relatives were being held and said some wounds went untreated.
“Their goal is to terrorize immigrants,” she said of the federal government. “They continue to demean and dehumanize a population that is integral to the state of Nebraska … We must not do this for them.”
 ‘Pissed off grandmas’ 

Don Hooper, a retired educator, was among several who decried the politics. He said he does not want “Cornhusker Clink” to join Nebraska’s “good life” and “home of Arbor Day” signs on the highway.

If the facility comes, he said: “It should be named … ‘Pillen’s prison’ in honor of the individual who wants this in Nebraska.”
McKinney said he appreciated a petition opposing the immigration detention center coordinated by Nebraska Appleseed, as it reflected statewide opinions. Appleseed’s Ruby Mendez said the effort collected more than 18,000 signatures from people in nearly 400 Nebraska communities.
Faith Colburn said she drove in from North Platte with concerns about legal and other services that migrants would have available in McCook. 
“I’m here representing 50 people,” she said. “Many of them are furious, pissed off grandmas.”
About 650 people also submitted written testimony to the Urban Affairs committee. Because it was for an interim hearing, McKinney said, the correspondence had not been categorized into opponents, proponents or neutral.
 Carniceria survival plan  

In McCook, Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they would not close shop, and hope that business picks up.

The family’s move six years ago from Kansas to the Nebraska community of about 7,200 people was calculated, they said. The area has a Walmart and other key stores that draw residents of surrounding towns.
Their two kids attend local schools, and have felt a sting from the proposed ICE facility. A classmate asked their daughter if she had seen her “new house,” said Camacho.
The small business owners said they are trying to form a group to provide information and support to Latinos in the community. They said they’ve enjoyed the McCook area and their patrons. 
The couple rode out the COVID-19 slump, opening the Carniceria’s doors every day. Gesturing toward the empty store and restaurant, Camacho said the plan now is to do the same: “Stay here, protect it, survive.”
He added, ‘If the community tells me I’m not welcome, we’ll move.”

The Nature Conservancy conducted a three-year pilot project on the technology. (Photo by Dale Maxson/The Nature Conservancy)Cattle at a nature preserve in eastern Iowa appear to roam the land freely — no fences or cowboys on horseback patrol their movement. 
Instead, these cows wear special collars that keep them from grazing beyond the boundaries their owners designate via a phone or computer. 
The Nature Conservancy has studied this form of virtual fencing with cattle at its Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve for the past three years with the hope that the technology can be integrated into other ranchers’ operations. 
Amy Crouch, The Nature Conservancy’s Little Sioux project director who headed the virtual fencing project, said the collars can give ranchers peace of mind, reduce labor on managed grazing operations and help put cattle onto more land.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With the collars, producers can do things like easily keep cattle from grazing — and therefore defecating — in vegetation near a stream, which protects water quality. They also know where a cow is if it gets out of bounds, and they are alerted if a cow has not moved for a certain period of time. 
Crouch said she grew up with milk cows and remembers the feeling of being tethered to the farm to take care of the cows. 
“I imagine it’s the same for a lot of these producers who do the intensely managed grazing, where they’re moving them all the time,” Crouch said. “If they could have this labor-saving device, so they can concentrate on doing other things too, how tremendous.”
But, the technology is still relatively new to the country, which is why Crouch said The Nature Conservancy decided to run a pilot project. Now, interested Iowans have somewhere to learn about the technology and how it might work on an Iowa landscape. 
How does the virtual fence work? 
Crouch said The Nature Conservancy project started around 2021 when a company from Norway appeared at a Practical Farmers of Iowa event and told her about the virtual fence technology. 
“Think of it like an invisible dog fence,” Crouch said, explaining how the virtual fencing works. “But a little more sophisticated and complicated.” 
Cows are suited up with a GPS-enabled collar that sits on their necks like a stereotypical cow bell.
Then, cattle are moved into a traditionally fenced paddock, but with one open side. Operators use a computer or smart phone to set the virtual fence around the open side so the cows can learn how the fence works.

When cattle get a certain distance from the virtual fence line, they’re sent an auditory tone, then another louder tone as they get closer and finally if they get too close the collar gives a vibration. Crouch said the collar doesn’t give a shock, but the vibration is unpleasant to the cow. 
“They catch on so fast,” Crouch said. “They hear that tone, and they don’t even stop grazing, they just change direction and go a different way. So it’s really, really easy on them, and it’s easy on the farmer too.” 
Once the cows are trained on the collars, farmers can move the cows to a fully virtual-fenced paddock and use the technology to move the cattle, gradually through different grazing areas. 
The collars are solar charged, so once they’re on the cows, farmers don’t have to worry about trying to wrestle with a cow to switch out a battery. 
Crouch said occasionally they have had issues with cattle sitting under tree shade most of the day and losing charge on their collars, but she said ranchers in more open spaces might not have to worry about that as much.
Benefits of virtual fencing
Producers who use highly managed grazing techniques, or grazing that strategically moves the cattle through different pastures to balance manure and plant regrowth, typically move their cattle every day or every couple of days. Crouch said the virtual fence would save hours of labor for these types of operations, which are believed to improve soil and water quality. 
At the Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve, Crouch said staff used the virtual fence to encourage cattle to chomp down on areas with an invasive species and then to stay out of sensitive areas like a wetland. 
But even for producers who don’t move their cattle as frequently, Crouch said the virtual fence alleviates a lot of time and a lot of worry, because farmers can see exactly where each head of their herd is with one glance at the application. 
It also saves time on fence management. With a virtual fence, farmers no longer have to spend time setting up and repairing fence lines.
Research into virtual fencing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Northwest Climate Hub found the technology could even be beneficial to ranchers who operate in areas susceptible to wildfires. While traditional fencing would burn, farmers could quickly adjust their virtual fence boundaries to keep cattle away from burned areas, or areas susceptible to fire. 
“Theoretically, you could have a cornfield in the middle of your pasture and they’d stay out — well, you know, as much as cattle can resist that,” Crouch said with a laugh. “The push and pull of the unpleasantness (from the collar deterrents) or corn.” 
A herd equipped with a virtual fence system could also graze the cover crop on a neighboring field, or the back corners of a field that would otherwise be too hard to put cattle on with traditional fencing. 
“The potential for all of that is just huge,” Crouch said. “…that’s one of the huge things, getting cattle back on the land.”
Implementing
Crouch said the collars and technology are slightly more expensive than the cost of installing a new fence. But, she said the year-to-year cost of fence maintenance and labor, give the virtual fencing an advantage over traditional fencing. 
Crouch said she has been “very impressed” by the durability of the collars even though they’re outside and on a cow 24/7. 
“They’re dunked in water tanks and rolled on the ground and smacked on trees and they’re fine,” Crouch said. 
The hardest part, she said, is learning to put the collars on. 
That’s why The Nature Conservancy wanted to launch a pilot project. Now, farmers who are interested in implementing the technology have someone local to turn to with questions. 
Each August, the conservancy has led a field day for interested parties to learn about the collars and how they have worked on an Iowa landscape, though this year’s field day was canceled due to flooding. 
The field days give farmers the opportunity to see how the technology works, before they decide to invest thousands of dollars to implement the system in their operation. 
“They’re able to see it practically before deciding whether they want to implement it on their own place,” Crouch said.

(Photo courtesy of Public School Employees of Washington.) School is finally back in session following a three-week delay at Evergreen Public Schools in southwest Washington, after unionized staff approved a deal with district administrators. 
Members of  Public School Employees of Washington  SEIU Local 1948 initiated the first strike in the union’s 57-year history on Aug. 26 following months of failed contract negotiations. 
The union represents 1,400 paraeducators, bus drivers, security officers, maintenance workers and other “classified” non-teacher staff at Evergreen Public Schools. They demanded that the district adequately compensate paraeducators, who assist teachers with classroom instruction, and address what the union described as critical understaffing.
“This agreement is the product of incredible strength and unity from Evergreen’s classified staff,” said Mindy Troffer-Cooper, president of the Evergreen chapter of Public School Employees of Washington.
The  Evergreen Public Schools board last week authorized its legal team to take “all lawful steps necessary” to end the strike, including filing a request in Clark County Superior Court for an injunction to force striking employees back to work. 
The district and union negotiators reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday, with union members voting to approve the agreement Thursday night. 
Class resumed on Friday, Sept. 12. The district has about 22,000 students.  
“Our members stood strong in the face of legal threats and misleading tactics because they knew what was at stake: stability for students, livable wages for staff, and respect for the work that keeps schools running,” Troffer-Cooper said. 
She attributed the success of the strike to solidarity across the labor community, thanking teachers, parents, students, community allies and other labor partners for supporting Evergreen’s classified staff. 
La Center educators to return to class, as Vancouver workers authorize a strike
Teachers at La Center School District in southwest Washington ended a week-long strike on Thursday after reaching a tentative agreement with the district. 
Members of the teacher’s union began striking Sept. 3. They sought higher wages to retain and attract quality staff and compete with neighboring districts.   
Union members planned to vote on the agreement on Friday. If approved, school will reopen on Monday, Sept. 15. Classes started in La Center on Aug. 27 and paused on Sept. 3. 
“We are looking forward to welcoming students back to their classrooms,” said Superintendent Peter Rosenkranz. 
Meanwhile, classified staff at Vancouver Public Schools voted Thursday to authorize a strike. 
A start date for the strike had not been announced as of Friday afternoon. 
Members of the Vancouver Association of Educational Support Professionals failed to reach an agreement after months of negotiations and have been without a contract since Aug. 31. 
The union represents over 800 paraeducators, clerks, secretaries, tech support specialists, maintenance workers and other staff. 
Union members are asking for additional training, increased staffing, shortened time between salary increases, and pay hikes for inclement weather and work-related injuries. 
“We deeply respect our VAESP labor partners and appreciate schools cannot run without these staff,” Vancouver Public Schools says on its website, adding that bargaining is “especially difficult right now” due to funding not matching the actual costs of operations.

,California,2025-09-12 23:36:44+00:00,CalMatters,California Legislature overrides local zoning to boost transit-oriented development,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/09/neighborhood-transit-upzoning/,"The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.","In summary
The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.


California lawmakers just laid the groundwork for a highly targeted building boom.
Senate Bill 79, authored by San Francisco Democrat Sen. Scott Wiener, would “upzone” neighborhoods immediately surrounding train, light rail and subway stations in many of the state’s most populous metro areas. That means apartment developers will be able to construct residential buildings — some as tall as 75 feet — regardless of what local zoning maps, elected officials or density-averse neighbors say. 
In a legislative year teeming with controversial housing bills designed to kick-start more construction in California, SB 79 has been among the most controversial. Because it would override the planning decisions of local governments, the bill had to overcome opposition from a host of city governments and their defenders in the Legislature, while fracturing the Capitol’s reigning Democratic Party over questions of affordability, labor standards and who ultimately has the final say over what gets built where.
The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom who supporters expect will sign it.
Wiener’s bill is meant to address two crises at once: The state’s long-term housing shortage and the financial precarity of its public transit agencies. By allowing taller and denser development, the legislation is meant to pave the way for more apartment developments in areas closest to jobs and services. By centering that development around public transit stations, it’s meant to steer more people away from cars and towards buses and trains. 
“Decades of overly restrictive policies have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes from the suburbs,” Wiener said in a statement after Friday’s vote. “Today’s vote is a dramatic step forward to undo these decades of harm, reduce our most severe costs, and slash traffic congestion and air pollution in our state.”
SB 79 would also give transit agencies the ability to develop their own land, giving them another potential revenue source — a financial model common across East Asian metros.
Making it easier to build on and around public transit stops has been a career-spanning effort for Wiener, who first introduced a version of the idea in 2018. That measure died in its first committee hearing. Wiener tried again in 2019 and 2020, but was never able to push the idea out of the Senate. 
That’s all helped to bestow the proposal with a kind of mythic status in California’s legislative housing wars. Its success at last slaps a symbolic bow on a year marked by the state Legislature’s unprecedented appetite for pro-development bills. Earlier this year lawmakers made national news in exempting most urban apartment projects from the state’s premier environmental review law.
California YIMBY, one of the sponsors of the bill and a vocal force in the Capitol for pro-construction legislation, was quick to take a victory lap after the final vote in the Senate this afternoon.
“Today, California YIMBY achieved one of its founding goals — legalizing apartments and condos near train stations,” said the organization’s CEO Brian Hanlon in a written statement. “We won many victories over the past eight years, but the dream of passing a robust, transit-oriented development program has long eluded us, until now.”
For opponents of state-imposed density measures, the vote marks an equally weighty defeat. 
Susan Kirsch, founder of Catalysts for Local Control, a nonprofit that advocates for the preservation of municipal authority over housing policy, predicted that the legislation would have a “devastating impact” on California’s low-rise neighborhoods, describing “extreme seven-story buildings next to single-family homes with nothing that the community can do about it.”
Amended to victory
The secret to Wiener’s success this year after so many past failures may be his willingness to whittle the bill down.
Over the course of the year, the proposal underwent 13 rounds of amendments — more than any other policy bill. Many of those changes were made to convince powerful interest groups to drop their opposition. That often meant reducing the bill’s scope.
The legislation would only apply to  counties with at least 15 passenger rail stations. According to its sponsors, just eight counties fit the bill: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo. 
That’s a concession that likely softened opposition from rural and suburban legislators. 
Rather than applying to every major bus line in the state, as the 2018 iteration did, SB 79 only targets homes within a half mile of train stations, subway stops and “high-frequency” light rail and commuter rail stops. Buildings within the nearest quarter mile of Amtrak stations, Bay Area Rapid Transit stops and Los Angeles subway stations can top out at roughly seven stories. But parcels further out or surrounding less-trafficked light rail stations would be capped at more modest heights.

The legislation also comes with asterisks about the kinds of projects that can make use of its provisions. Developers, in select cases, must hire unionized construction workers — a provision that convinced the powerful State Building and Construction Trades Council to drop its opposition. 
Projects must also set aside a modest share of homes for lower-income residents (at least 7%) and replace any rent-controlled units that are destroyed during construction. Lower-income neighborhoods also have more time to plan for the rezoning with the new rules not taking effect until at least 2032. That compromise led a number of tenant rights,“housing justice” advocacy groups and other affordability advocates to stand down earlier this week.
Case in point: Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat who, as chair of the Senate’s Housing committee, nearly killed the bill earlier this year, was the second to speak in favor of it on Friday. 
In a fig leaf to ticked off local governments, the bill also allows cities that are already planning for transit-oriented apartment buildings at a significant scale, such as San Francisco and Sacramento, to stick with those plans rather than abide by the full scope of the new law. 
“If you look at the bill and you read the bill, I actually view it as a thoughtful, relatively narrow-in-scope bill,” Oakland Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland and frequent political ally of Wiener’s on housing matters, said on the Assembly floor Thursday. 
Reshaping the American Dream
Many of her fellow legislators, Democratic and Republican alike, disagreed.
The Senate ultimately passed the bill by the narrowest possible margin, with Wiener only claiming his final vote from Bakersfield GOP Sen. Shannon Grove after a few tense minutes. The Assembly vote was equally close, with just 43 of the chamber’s 80 members supporting it. 
“This blunt, one-size-fits-all bill will not work for a district like mine,” said Assemblymember Rick Chavez-Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat who represents portions of Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. “For many Californians, living in a single-family neighborhood fulfills a lifelong dream — the American Dream.”  
Placing apartment blocks in those neighborhoods “has the potential to fundamentally reshape my district without the benefit of careful land-use planning,’ he said.
Zbur was partially channeling opposition from his counterparts in local government. Last month, a narrow majority on the Los Angeles City Council voted to oppose SB 79, which members characterized as a Sacramento power grab and a giveaway to real estate developers. The city is one of dozens of municipalities that came out against the measure.

Supporters counter that deferring to local governments on land use decisions has resulted in a chronic undersupply of new housing, as local elected officials have historically catered to the interests of change-averse homeowners. 
Marc Vukcevich, a policy director for the LA-based transit and pedestrian advocacy group Streets For All, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he didn’t think the city of Los Angeles’ opposition to the measure carried much weight.
“The Legislature knows that LA is a deeply unserious actor when it comes to housing,” he said.
Most significant housing bill ever?
For all the concessions Wiener made along the way, backers of the bill are still calling the proposal historic.
“It’s by far the biggest housing bill the California Legislature has passed,” said Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY. “There’s more to do, but it’s a major, major step. And honestly, I feel like as people start to see what is actually going to happen, the politics will start to change too.”
“The fear is Hong Kong. I think the reality is going to be something closer to Copenhagen — not everyone is going to build the maximum demand,” he said.
Whether homeowners in Palo Alto, mid-city San Diego and the San Fernando Valley ultimately come to appreciate the new apartment developments in their communities will depend on whether any get built in the first place. 
Past upzoning efforts in California have proven to be more ambitious on paper than in practice. In 2021, state lawmakers passed Senate Bill 9, a measure that both supporters and opponents said would end single-family zoning in California by allowing homeowners to build up to four units on their property. Four years in, the law has resulted in precious few units. Housing advocates point to costly requirements and loopholes that made the law difficult for property owners to actually use.
Simon Büchler, an economist at the Miami University in Ohio who has studied the results of different upzoning policies, said developers are generally keen to build around public transportation stations, making SB 79 a promising approach.
“The success of upzoning depends crucially on where it happens,” he said in an email. “Ideally, you want to upzone in high-demand areas with strong transit connections, since those are the places where added density will translate into meaningful increases in supply.”
In any case, the changes will be gradual. “Supply increases take time (often many years) to materialize, even in the right places, so these policies are far from an overnight solution,” he said.
Cobbling together enough single-family homes in a desirable transit-adjacent neighborhood is easier said than done, said Mott Smith, a developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association. Land values are steep. Finding enough sufficiently large land all in one place requires a fair bit of luck. Both make it hard to profitably build a six-story apartment building. 
“We will probably see in the next five years 20 to 30 SB 79 projects around the state, that’s my wild guess,” he said. “Both the opponents and the proponents of the bill are probably overstating how much this is going to change the built environment in California.”
That could be especially true in the current economic climate. Tariffs on building goods, immigration crackdowns targeting construction workers and high interest rates show no sign of abating, factors that make it hard to build — close to a train station or not.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_Oakland-Housing_AW_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers decided Friday to release withheld funding to 40 cities and towns and give them extra time to update the state on required water and sewer system audits.
The decision came after the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee spent two hours debating whether to give the municipalities further grace for their unfiled 2022 audit reports, which were due to the state July 1, 2024. Each municipality must provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit by Dec. 31 or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by that date. Lack of compliance will result in the state withholding funds again.
Local governments receive two types of “turnback funds” from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
In order to receive turnback funds, municipalities must file audits of their water and sewer systems with Arkansas Legislative Audit no later than 18 months after the end of the audit’s fiscal year. Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline, and the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
The Counties and Municipalities subcommittee of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee voted in July to authorize the treasurer’s office to withhold these funds from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Since July, the municipalities of Delight, Horseshoe Lake and Pollard had their funding restored after submitting their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024, according to a list of delinquent municipalities Deputy Legislative Auditor Joe Archer provided the Advocate.
Of the remaining 40 municipalities, 14 have submitted their 2022 audit reports, according to the list, and nine have also submitted their 2023 audit reports. The remaining 26 municipalities have yet to submit any water and sewer audit reports for the past three fiscal years.
Turnback funds are disbursed on the 10th of every month, meaning the 40 municipalities did not receive their usual September disbursement. The two months of withheld funds from the municipalities total $477,797.71, according to data treasurer’s office fiscal director Kathie Williams provided the Advocate.

 
 Committee debate

Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, was one of Act 453’s sponsors. He proposed the grace period until Dec. 31 and the release of the 40 municipalities’ turnback funds at Thursday’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee meeting.
Wallace’s motion passed the subcommittee, but members of the full committee balked Friday when asked to approve the subcommittee’s actions.
Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, proposed that the committee vote separately on the turnback funds issue because the subcommittee’s decision might be “in direct conflict with state law.” Womack’s motion failed on a roll call vote.
There were no representatives present from the Attorney General’s office to comment on the legality of Wallace’s proposal. Legislative Audit Legal Counsel Emily White said the proposal implied that the 40 municipalities were “in compliance” with Act 453 “when based on our interpretation of the law, they might not be.”
White pointed out that Act 453 does not give the state treasurer’s office any discretion not to withhold turnback funds if lawmakers notify the office that a municipality’s audit reports are late.
Wallace said lawmakers’ responsibilities include making decisions outside of regular legislative sessions and “not to hide behind the bureaucracy.”
“If we can’t come down here and make decisions that affect our state, we might as well go ahead and stay home and play dominoes,” Wallace said.
The committee accepted the subcommittee’s report, including the release of the turnback funds, on a roll call vote with 16 members voting yes. The decision authorized the Republican co-chairs, Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and Sen. Jim Petty of Van Buren, to notify the treasurer’s office that the body rescinded its July referral of the delinquent municipalities.
Lundstrum was among the 12 lawmakers to vote against the motion, calling it “dangerous uncharted territory” for the committee to effectively change a provision of a law.

Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, also opposed the motion. She said she disagreed with Wallace that lawmakers can make decisions about how to apply laws outside legislative sessions.
“Whether you like the law or not, that’s what we voted on as legislators,” Mayberry said. “If it needs to be changed, then we need to do something to do it the right way. This is not the right way to do it. This is allowing a small, little group of people the power to override the rest of the members here.”
 Local impact

Lawmakers who supported releasing the turnback funds said cities and towns in their districts were struggling and would continue to struggle if they lost more monthly income.
Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, said “small towns in the Delta” have few accountants at their disposal. He also said local governments have higher priorities than completing audits, such as providing safe water and sewer services.
Rep. Howard Beaty and Sen. Ben Gilmore, both Crossett Republicans, also said the withheld funds directly impact their constituents. 
“We’re not changing law by taking this action,” Beaty said. “We’re giving grace to some communities that need it, some of the most impoverished communities that we have in the state.”
Beaty and Gilmore represent Lake Village, a city of about 2,000 people that had nearly $34,000 withheld in August and September.
The city froze its spending and hiring in response to the funding shortage, Lake Village Mayor Eddy Bush told the Advocate. He said the city has already provided the state a letter of engagement with an accountant promising the completion of the required audits by Dec. 31.
Bush and Elaine Mayor Lisa Hicks-Gilbert both said they were relieved to learn that their cities will receive their regularly scheduled turnback funds for the rest of the year.
The roughly $4,000 per month in turnback funds makes up the largest revenue source for Elaine, Hicks-Gilbert said. The city of just over 500 people is in McElroy’s district and has no local sales tax to bring in additional revenue.
Elaine residents rejected a ballot measure to create a local sales tax last year. Hicks-Gilbert said she urged citizens to support the measure in case the city’s state funding stopped or became precarious.

The funding shortage forced the city not to make some purchases, and it would have had to make budget cuts if lawmakers hadn’t decided to restore the funding, Hicks-Gilbert said.
“$4,000 or $5,000 is not a lot of money, but it is when it’s all you have to fall on,” she said.
Like Lake Village, Elaine has obtained letters of engagement from accountants who should complete the audits by year’s end, Hicks-Gilbert said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wallace_MJohnson-scaled-e1757717723194-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)BELLEVUE — Top U.S. House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries traveled here Friday to decry rising health insurance costs he says are driven by recent actions from congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.
Low-income Americans face the combination of steep cuts to Medicaid in the years to come and the looming expiration of federal tax credits that help them afford insurance coverage. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange through the Affordable Care Act are set to rise an average of 21% next year, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer announced this week. 
This hike is in line with similar jumps across the country. Last year’s average rate increase was 10.7%. The state has to approve the rate increases if they’re actuarially justified. 
Jeffries said he’s willing to risk a government shutdown if Republicans don’t reverse what he sees as an assault on health care. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government.
“Democrats will support a bipartisan spending agreement that is negotiated between the House and the Senate, if it lifts up the quality of life of the American people, with a focus on three areas, their health, their safety and their economic wellbeing,” said Jeffries, a New York congressman. “We will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people.”
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday he and Jeffries are united in opposing any funding plan that doesn’t include their health care demands.
Jeffries appeared at a press conference at Overlake Medical Center, alongside Gov. Bob Ferguson, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer and U.S. Reps. Suzan DelBene and Kim Schrier.
“It’s great to be with folks who are smart and strategic and substantive and be able to say I’m in Washington at the same period of time,” Jeffries quipped.
He was set to participate in a Seattle-area fundraiser Friday evening for DelBene hosted by state Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove. DelBene chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Subsidies set to expire
Nearly 300,000 residents buy health plans through the exchange, which serves people who don’t get coverage from their work or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid, known in Washington as Apple Health, or Medicare. Three-quarters of those Washingtonians qualified for federal premium tax credits that helped drop annual premiums an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually, according to Ferguson’s office.
But those subsidies, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, will expire at the end of the year without congressional action. In July, the exchange reported the expiration would lead to 80,000 people in Washington choosing to forego coverage. 
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers. Nationwide, costs for insurance on the marketplace are estimated to rise more than 75%, with more than 4 million people going uninsured, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF.
Some Republicans have expressed an openness to extending the tax credits, even if just for one year.
The uninsured rate in Washington was 4.8% as of 2023. For years, the state made progress getting more people health insurance, but officials say that headway is now threatened.
“We’ve come far in making healthcare more accessible and affordable, but we still have much more work to do,” said DelBene, D-Medina. “We should be talking about what we do to go forward, not going backward.”
Overlake CEO and President Jon Duarte anticipates hospitals will have to deal with providing more uncompensated care, straining their finances, if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
Kuderer said Congress needs to act quickly if lawmakers are going to extend tax credits, as her office would need to approve revised rates in time for open enrollment, which begins Nov. 1 and lasts until Jan. 15.
The Washington Health Benefit Exchange Board plans to ask the state Legislature for tens of millions of dollars in funding to mitigate the loss of the tax credits.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Meanwhile, the state is also bracing for drastic cuts to Medicaid that Congress passed in the so-called “big, beautiful bill.” 
The stated goal is rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the insurance program for low-income Americans. 
Critics here in Washington say new work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and other changes in the law could cost the state billions per year in federal funding, force hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians to lose coverage and strain hospitals. 
The work requirements don’t take effect until January 2027, so it will take a while to know the effects of the law, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4463-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

Sept. 11, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz/Michigan AdvanceANN ARBOR – At the intersection of Fuller Road and Medical Center Drive outside the University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, a wave of chants criticizing the health care institution echoed alongside shouts and honking of drivers.
The scene was a show of frustration and anger, all in support of transgender youth who will now be denied gender affirming care due to the hospital system’s decision to end that care.
At least one hundred demonstrators, carrying signs and waving transgender flags, were there among students and community members who gathered Thursday afternoon to protest the decision following federal pressure.
The statewide hospital network in August said that it would stop providing medically necessary gender affirming health care services – such as prescribing puberty blockers and gender affirming hormones – for patients under age 19. University of Michigan Health and its Michigan Medicine brand argued the decision was made due to an ongoing federal “criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors.”
“The [system] is one of multiple institutions across the country that have received a federal subpoena as part of a criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors,” said Mary Masson, senior director of public relations at Michigan Medicine, in a statement in response to the rally. “In light of that investigation, and given escalating external threats and risks, we will no longer provide gender affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blocker medications for minors.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In mid-July, the U.S. Department of Justice issued several subpoenas to dozens of health care institutions and doctors across the country “involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.”. The action by the federal government under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, seeking to limit funding for hospitals and providers offering gender-affirming care to minors, are aimed at what the administration has called “gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth.”
At the rally Thursday, demonstrators were joined by a series of speakers, including community leaders, local politicians, and hospital officials, all focused on the vital importance of these services for many transgender youths. They also touched on the threat posed by the decision and the ripple effect for other Michigan health institutions, bolstered by anonymous testimonies from affected transgender minors.

Washtenaw County Commissioner Yousef Rabhi, a former state representative and the legislative director for the Michigan Nurses Association, said transgender youth in his community deserve necessary and life-sustaining care. Taking that away from them was “a crime.” 
“And at the end of the day, I want to remind us all of the people who make the decisions at this university,” Rabhi said. “They’re elected by all of us. Every two years, you have an opportunity to elect regents. Use that opportunity to hold them accountable.”
Christina Helou, a doctor of physical therapy at University of Michigan Health, told Michigan Advance that restricting access to gender-affirming care was irresponsible. 
“This decision is not based on fact, Helou said. “It is not based on science. It is not based on medical health care evidence. It is strictly based on political pressure from this administration because they’re transphobic.”
Although the university didn’t specify details of the federal subpoena it received, a report from Talking Points Memo showed that the justice department’s  requests received on July 14 was similar to those sent to Philadelphia’s Children’s Hospital, where “individual doctors received a hold order not to destroy documents” and the DOJ was “pursuing a civil and criminal investigation.” 
Doctors are now worried they could face heavy legal fees and potentially lose their medical licenses.
The report, published on Aug. 25, also explains that U of M members were already aware that they would receive new federal requirements a few weeks in advance, and DOJ lawyers were investigating doctors suspected of misusing their authority to prescribe medication, among other potential charges.
Within these federal requests, the New York Times reported that, based on the subpoena sent to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the justice department requested detailed personal information of minor patients, including their names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and parents’ information. Additionally, information about hospital staff, contractors, and affiliates involved in gender-affirming health services, as well as communications between the hospital and providers, was also required.
On Wednesday, Corewell Health released a statement to its patients announcing it, too,would no longer provide gender-affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blockers to minors, arguing a “serious risk of legal and regulatory action.” Corewell is now the latest Michigan health care system to discontinue gender-affirming care for minors under federal pressure.

On Friday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she was deeply disappointed in Corewell’s decision.
“They have chosen to capitulate to the federal administration’s discriminatory campaign against the trans community, despite Corewell not being a target of any federal action in this realm,” Nessel said in a statement. “Corewell’s shortsighted approach to conform their treatment options and ‘obey in advance’ fails to adequately consider the long-term consequences to the health, safety and well-being of their patients. Michigan law has not changed; gender affirming care remains legal and is approved healthcare by leading healthcare associations.”
Nessel also said the hospitals have chosen to disregard science, best practices, and the recommendations of every major medical society in the nation. She said that created a dangerous precedent that could long-lasting implications on all patients, not just transgender youth.
“We have seen virtue signaling from the federal administration that they intend to detrimentally attack many other areas of public health and medical treatment,” Nessel said. “We must ask ourselves: what other medical practices or care will this Administration target next – reproductive care, vaccines, scientific studies – and will our healthcare institutions quickly succumb to such pressure each and every time?
Parents of transgender children have been left in a state of uncertainty and frustration.
“She had her exit appointment last Thursday, and after that, she became aware that the world is coming to get her. She is devastated,” said Kami Michels, 46, a board member of the Jim Toy Community Center, who told the Advance about hardships her 16-year-old transgender daughter has felt since U of M stopped her gender-affirming care after five years.

Even though Masson specified that U of M is working closely with all impacted patients, and that they “will continuously support the well-being of our patients, their families, and our teams,” for Michels, the reality looks different. 
Although her daughter was able to secure a prescription that will last for years, Michels feels guilty because not everyone has been as fortunate. 
“I have already secured her ongoing care, which not everyone is going to be able to do,” she said.
Michels also criticized the university for abandoning transgender children, claiming that the university’s words of support for the community do not reflect actions in line with federal guidance. 
“Don’t send us another email about how much you care about civil rights,” Michels said. “You say you won’t tolerate totalitarianism; then why are you letting it run your hospital? We are coming for your pocketbook. … Not a single cent of our money will go to you because we know that’s all you really care about. We will not stand by while you abandon the kids who need you most.”

The federal program, which funds nutrition and exercise education for eligible recipients, will end Sept. 30, eliciting worry from officials and providers.

The SNAP-Ed program — which focuses on nutrition education and overall wellness for people on food stamps — will end Sept. 30, cutting off hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual grants that supported programming across all Vermont counties, including recipe demonstrations, meal kits and active-living guides.
The program’s elimination was part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget adjustments that passed on July 4 in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As the state’s food assistance network finds its way through a new landscape of shortfalls, officials worry more residents will fall through the cracks.
SNAP-Ed is an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which has experienced a number of cuts across the board. Instead of providing funds for individuals to purchase food, SNAP-Ed’s much smaller grants focus on community education and initiatives to improve eligible households’ engagement with 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s name for the larger body of resources under SNAP. 
“Just providing food for people is not the whole answer to food security,” said Suzanne Kelly, who was the SNAP-Ed coordinator at the Vermont Department of Health for a decade until last month. Her former position, and another related role, will soon be discontinued.
“SNAP-Ed is sort of that extra bit of information to really make sure that people can access the food, can use the food, and can enjoy it over time,” Kelly said.
The program is deeply focused on health outcomes, she said, including prevention of chronic conditions and disease, and promoting wellness through nutrition and exercise.
Kelly is concerned about the immediate impact on Vermonters. 
“These are decisions that trickle down to the most vulnerable people in our communities,” she said.
Kelly referenced a SNAP-Ed needs assessment earlier this year that identified certain populations in the state with a disproportionately high need for food assistance, including rural Vermonters and people with disabilities. Outreach programs that meet people where they are geographically will be an especially big loss, Kelly said.
The end of SNAP-Ed has already had tangible effects in recent weeks, causing the imminent shutdown of a food pantry in Holland and contributing to the Vermont Foodbank’s recent staff cuts. Of the seven employees the food bank let go, three were specifically operating SNAP-Ed programs, according to Chris Meehan, the company’s chief impact officer.
Vermont residents received over $147 million in SNAP aid last year. The projected allocation for Vermont’s SNAP-Ed budget in 2026, which the Department of Health received May 30, was less than half a million. Five weeks later, Kelly learned that the program was canceled.
‘We’ll have to be really creative’
Meehan said the SNAP-Ed cuts will effectively end the Vermont Foodbank’s VTFresh program, which has reached every county in the state with initiatives to increase access and understanding around nutrition. The program provided a space for people to exchange knowledge about cooking, recipes and budgeting, and was often particularly useful for families, she said.
While the food bank employees who ran the initiative are no longer with the organization, the program’s existing resources will remain on the Vermont Foodbank website. VTFresh’s continuing presence, Meehan said, will be “more passive than active.”
Meehan is grateful for the infrastructure that VTFresh has left behind — it has been “transformational” for the food assistance network in the state, she said. 
Denise Walton, a Concord resident who is a lead volunteer at Sid’s Pantry in town, said VTFresh recipe materials had been invaluable in allowing her community to make better use of fresh foods. It’s common, she said, for people to ask questions about how to prepare food as they’re taking it.
“I think people want to cook,” said Walton, who herself is on food stamps. “They may not have learned, or been taught, or had the time.”
Walton said she would keep trying to provide resources to help people fully use the food they’re receiving — but that it will be more challenging going forward. 
“We’ll have to be really creative,” Walton said.
Vermont Foodbank’s situation is par for the course statewide at smaller food assistance providers.
The Vermont Garden Network will lose its dedicated nutrition educator, according to executive director T Hanson, one of only five staff at the organization. Come Alive Outside, a nonprofit which used SNAP-Ed funds to reach thousands of school-age kids in Rutland County with tips on how to stay active, has told its staff it may not have sufficient funds to pay everyone in six months, according to Executive Director Arwen Turner. 
Meanwhile, in Burlington, the People’s Farmstand will continue as a purely volunteer effort, according to founding Director Nour El-Naboulsi. There hadn’t been salaried roles, he clarified, but they had previously been able to offer staff — primarily farmers — a stipend for their time. The organization offers free fresh produce (both self-grown and donated) at weekly open events but has also been conducting educational outreach through its Veggie of the Month program. 
El-Naboulsi said the initiative features a combination of staple Vermont crops and “culturally relevant produce — things from Nepal, Somalia, Iraq (and) other places in the Middle East and East Africa.” The organization serves a relatively large proportion of immigrant and refugee populations, he said, and the program is designed to combine familiar food with information about how to prepare local produce.
With the loss of SNAP-Ed funding to the People’s Farmstand and sister organization Village Hydroponics, El-Naboulsi said he has had to reprioritize.
“We kind of lose the capacity to do supplementary education, recipe preparation, outreach,” he said.
‘A great return on investment’
Keith Robinson, a pediatric pulmonologist at UVM Children’s Hospital, emphasized a connection between SNAP-Ed and health outcomes for families. He’s the hospital’s vice chair for Quality Improvement and Population Health and built the provider’s screening platform for food insecurity.
“We are trying to go deeper and further upstream to make sure that we’re solving the root causes of food insecurity in Vermont,” Robinson said.
For him, nutrition education has been a big part of that work — that’s why the end of SNAP-Ed is such a blow, despite the small scale of previous funding.
“It’s gonna make communities potentially less healthy, and it’s also gonna create gaps in the systems that we need to have around families,” he said. “While the dollar value may not be great, the impact of those dollars is extraordinary.”
Robinson referenced a state report on SNAP-Ed last year, calling survey data that indicated diet and exercise changes for participants “a big deal.” Roughly a third of people who received direct nutrition education reported they ate more fruits and vegetables each day, and 20% said they exercised more, according to the report.
“That’s a great return on investment,” Robinson said.
Modifications and cuts to the SNAP program at large have been made in the name of eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse” — a narrative that Kelly disputed. 
“The strategies that are used (in SNAP-Ed) have shown outcomes — real outcomes,” she said.
A page addressing cost concerns on the USDA website references studies showing that for every dollar spent on SNAP-Ed and similar programs, 10 times that can be saved in future health care costs. The total nationwide cost of the program would have been $550 million in the 2026 fiscal year.
“It’s probably not the best idea to be cutting programs that are going to eventually help reduce costs way further down the line,” Kelly said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.
A document briefly detailing SNAP overhaul from the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture called SNAP-Ed a program that has wrought “no meaningful change” for its target population. The committee cited a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office that appears to primarily conclude that the effectiveness of the program is difficult to properly evaluate due to uneven standards of reporting from state agencies and a lack of coordination at the federal level. 
“When federal benefits get cut like this, we need to think about how to bolster connections in our community, and think differently about how to fill those gaps,” Robinson said. 
Jeanne Montross, executive director of Helping Overcome Poverty’s Effects, or HOPE, in Middlebury, said her organization has been seeing the effects of staff and program cuts elsewhere in the state’s assistance networks. Montross’ nonprofit is primarily funded by private contributions.
“It always ends up flowing down to HOPE,” she said of increased need in her local community.
Anore Horton, executive director at Hunger Free Vermont, said the state’s food assistance network “cannot in any way mitigate the loss of all of these different sources of funding.”
Any solution to a problem of this scale must be “collective,” Horton said, but must also involve significant new assistance from the state government. But in a situation this urgent, Horton said it wouldn’t necessarily make sense for the state to replace nutrition education funding.
Walton said Sid’s Pantry has also been increasingly relying on community support and donations.
“We’re very fortunate to have a little buffering like that,” she said, “especially for an aging community that needs healthy food and needs access to things out in the rural areas.”

The decision issued earlier this month comes in a lawsuit filed more than four years ago challenging delays in the state’s court system associated with obtaining civil complaints.

A federal judge has granted an injunction against the Vermont judiciary in a legal action brought by news outlets aimed at curbing delays when seeking newly filed civil lawsuits.
The ruling issued this month by Judge Christina Reiss is the latest turn in the lawsuit brought by news outlets and other First Amendment advocates more than four years ago.
The judge added in the ruling that she would now consider whether to grant attorneys fees to cover the expenses of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of the organizations, a figure that is expected to total more than $1 million.

Reiss, in the four-page order, wrote that the process the judiciary had used to screen lawsuits for potential confidential materials before making them publicly available delayed the release of the records and violated the First Amendment rights of the news outlets. 
According to the legal action, the timely access to the filings allows for the public to understand what’s happening in the court system, provides for accountability and informs people about matters of public concern.
“Plaintiffs have a presumptive right First Amendment right of access to newly filed complaints, which attaches upon the court’s receipt of such complaints,” Reiss wrote in the ruling.
Courthouse News Service, a Pasadena, California-based company, was joined by news outlets across Vermont in its lawsuit filed in May 2021 in federal court in Burlington. 
Courthouse News Service, according to its website, “covers news, both national and international, that moves society and its many elements in one direction or another.”
Jonathan G. Fetterly, a California attorney who argued the case on behalf of parties bringing the action, said in a statement this week that Reiss’ ruling was a “great victory for public access” following years of “hard fought litigation.” 
The parties joining in the legal action were the Vermont Press Association and the New England First Amendment Coalition, as well as the parent entities of VTDigger.org, Seven Days, the Burlington Free Press and WCAX-TV. 
Other participants signing onto the case were the Vermont Community Newspaper Group, which operates weekly newspapers in several communities including Stowe, Morristown, Shelburne, South Burlington and Charlotte, and the parent company of the Rutland Herald/Barre-Montpelier Times Argus.
“This is another important victory for the public when it comes to transparency at the courts all across Vermont,” Mike Donoghue, executive director of the Vermont Press Association, said Friday of the ruling.
Teri Corsones, Vermont’s state court administrator, said in a text message Friday, “The Judiciary certainly values the public’s right to access to court filings, while also taking important steps to protect sensitive information.”
Corsones referred specific questions related to the ruling to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which represented the judiciary in the lawsuit. In turn, the Attorney General’s Office, later Friday, referred specific questions about the ruling to judiciary officials. Leda Moloff, general counsel for the Vermont judiciary, wrote in a text late Friday that judiciary officials had no further comment.
The lawsuit has been working its way through the court system for years, including a stop at the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals before landing back in federal district court in Vermont earlier this year. 
Courthouse News Service, in a filing more than two years ago, stated that the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with bringing the action already totaled more than $1 million. 
Reiss, the judge, asked the parties to submit a briefing schedule related to attorneys’ fees by later this month regarding the issue.

(Caspar Benson / Getty Images)A 19-year-old New Mexico man is facing federal charges after admitting to the FBI that he posted violent threats online in the wake of the recent shooting death of Charlie Kirk, including a threat toward an Ohio City Councilor, federal prosecutors announced Friday afternoon.
Jace Allen, of Jamestown, N.M., began making threatening posts on X, shortly after Kirk’s assassination at an event at Utah Valley in Orem, Utah on Sept. 10. Some of the exchanges mentioned Kirk’s death, including one from Allen, in which he said: “I will harm anyone who has something bad to say about Charlie.”
In more than a dozen posts, Allen said he was going to “commit mass murder” targeting Black, Jewish and liberal people, as well as other individual people on line he said he was “coming for,” according to the criminal complaint. Many of the posts are still online. The account has 0 followers.
Bomb threats to New Mexico lawmakers sent via email, police say

An FBI agent in Toledo, Ohio, received a tip about the posts Thursday, including one against an Ohio City Council member that said, “You’re going to be one of the first to die. I’ll be seeing you soon,” according to the criminal complaint.
The Ohio FBI agent tracked the account to a home in Jamestown and notified an FBI agent in Gallup, according to the complaint. Around 6 p.m. yesterday, the agent interviewed Allen at his home, where Allen said he identifies as a Neo-Nazi, according to the complaint. 
“Allen believes a civil war is inevitable in the United States and wants to help spark the civil war by terrorizing people online,” FBI agent Michael Dalpini wrote in the complaint filed Friday.
Allen allegedly told the agent that, while he does not own a gun, he wanted to buy a rifle with a scope that is the same make, model and style of the kind police say was used to assassinate Kirk, according to the complaint. 
However, when Allen gave the FBI agent consent to search his phone, police found two videos from mid-August of him shooting a rifle and handgun at an unknown location, according to the complaint.

The awards honor excellence in digital journalism around the world.


CalMatters was named the best medium-sized newsroom in the 2025 Online Journalism Awards. CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won the association’s Impact Award. The honors were announced Friday at the Online News Association awards ceremony in New Orleans.
In addition, one of CalMatters’ board members, Robert Hernandez, was honored with the Rich Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award.
First Place, General Excellence
CalMatters won first place for general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms. 
Judges said they “chose to honor the innovative Digital Democracy project and the comprehensive multi-platform Voter Guide, recognizing a winner that fully meets the criteria for general excellence. These useful, hands-on tools and their stories that led to real-world impact stood out as fulfilling their mission to demystify California government.”
Neil Chase, CEO, accepted the award for CalMatters and said, “It is deeply meaningful to be cited for this work by people who know better than anybody else what we do and why it matters. I’m accepting this on behalf of the 80 people at CalMatters and all the other folks who work with us: the partners we have around California, around the country — a number of whom are in this room — the broadcasters and news organizations in California who help us get this news out to people.”
Here are some highlights of CalMatters’ work over the past year:

Our stories and tools made government actions and decisions relatable, held leaders accountable and gave Californians vital information to engage with their government – resulting in impact felt across the state. In journalism, impact can take seconds or it can take years. When it comes to big issues we bring persistent, accountability coverage, and this year, we’ve seen that result in widespread impact: a California state audit (triggered by a 2023 CalMatters investigation) found that a law meant to reveal who funds state legislators’ sponsored travel is falling short, state legislators advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight (directly citing an ongoing CalMatters investigation on conditions inside homeless shelters), and California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000 for campaign finance violations (after a 2020 CalMatters story). This is only a fraction of the impact we’ve had.
Our Voter Guide has been a powerhouse resource that has helped Californians figure out how they want to vote. In 2024, we reached our widest audience thus far, by meeting voters where they were. We created TikTok videos and filters, launched an interactive ballot preview tool, partnered with local publications to show readers articles relevant to their ballot, created magazine-style quizzes that hundreds of Californians used at 40+ in-person events, printed a Voter Guide zine, added Chinese and Korean translations in addition to Spanish, and a version for English learners. One in five California voters used our guide.
Our Digital Democracy platform, launched in 2024, shows video and transcripts from every hearing, logs every vote, provides data on lobbyists and an easy way to track bills. We’ve also trained journalists in 20+ newsrooms on how to use our AI-generated tipsheets. With the help of our tipsheets, CBS News partnered with us to reveal that California’s one-party supermajority legislature systematically avoids transparency and accountability by killing controversial legislation without voting on the record. Digital Democracy has been awarded an Emmy and won the Poynter Institute’s Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation.

Congratulations to finalists ProPublica, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune.
CalMatters was a finalist in the same category of general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms last year, won by ProPublica. The Markup, now part of CalMatters, won the award last year among small-sized newsrooms.
Finalist, Social Media Engagement
CalMatters was a finalist for excellence in social media engagement among medium-sized newsrooms.
Last year, CalMatters used TikTok to share nonpartisan Voter Guide information and to meet younger voters where they are:

Made-for-Gen Z TikToks: We experimented a lot, failing multiple times before we found our first viral success when we started breaking down California propositions using a call center format. We created skits where a reporter played both a confused voter and a call center prop expert. TikTokers started paying attention, and we kept going, making and trying out organic ways to reach young voters on TikTok.
Launching our own TikTok filter: Like in previous elections, we created online interactive quizzes that helped California voters figure out where they stood on each of the statewide propositions. But in 2024, after being inspired by lighthearted beauty industry TikTok filters that asked viewers to vote for makeup by tilting their heads, we created a series of CalMatters TikTok filters asking you if you thought the rent was too damn high — and other similar questions — that could help TikTokers decide how they’d vote on the state’s ballot propositions this year. (Our demo.) Our quiz filters were used over 20,000 times in the two weeks before the election.
Working with California influencers: For the first time ever, CalMatters worked with influencers to help make sure our voter guide reached young voters on TikTok. We selected six influencers based on common criteria — they were in California, they normally posted lifestyle videos, and they thought of young adults as one of their main audiences. We also asked them to clearly disclose that CalMatters was sponsoring their post, to create videos in their own voice, and to tell their audience about our voter guide.

Congratulations to The Marshall Project, who won, and our fellow finalists, National Geographic and The Baltimore Banner. This is CalMatters’ first honor in the excellence in social media category.
Impact Award
CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won this year’s ONA Impact Award. The honor is for “a trailblazing individual whose work in digital journalism and dedication to innovation exhibits a substantial impact on the industry, regardless of their tenure in journalism.”
Rodney Gibbs, an ONA board member, presented the award and said, “Andrew’s work on developing The Coral Project … brought the comment section into the modern era, and it created a system that dozens of sites still use today. …[Now] in his new role at CalMatters, he’s bringing that organization’s award-winning journalism to a broader audience, and through development of tools and processes, he is helping to give Californians more agency and more access to what’s going on inside their state.”
Accepting the award, Losowsky said, “True impact occurs when journalism improves the lives of the communities it serves. … A real community is a lot more than an audience. Communities are groups of people who engage, interact and support each other. Communities are how we build trust, how we create common knowledge, how we share our humanity, how we feel less alone.”
He continued, discussing recent attacks on independent journalism, “For our industry, for this nation, for every single one of us in this room and out there, if and when [targeted attacks on individuals and journalists] come, I look forward to us standing strong, in community, together.”
Before joining CalMatters, Losowsky was the founding head of Coral, a community platform used by more than 500 major news websites in 28 countries. He ran Coral for ten years, managing its acquisition by Vox Media, and overseeing community strategy across the organization.
Losowsky is the co-creator of Perspectives, a project that helps journalists find inspiration from a broader range of work and practice, and generates connections with experts in other industries. He is also an advisor to Documented, and a founding member of the News Product Alliance.
Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award
The award, bestowed on CalMatters’ board member Robert Hernandez, is for someone who “has significantly advanced or made lasting contributions to the field of digital journalism through their work in the industry, and who exhibits extraordinary commitment to the mission, value and vision of ONA.”
Hernandez is a professor of professional practice at USC Annenberg who focuses on exploring and developing the intersection of technology and journalism. His work emphasizes empowering people through informative reporting and storytelling, community engagement, growing content distribution models, and supporting journalism financially.
Accepting the award, Hernandez said, “Despite my chaos muppet energy, they gave me this award. I am a misfit that often feels out of place, but I’ve been a blessed misfit where people have looked out for me. They welcomed me to places and that really shaped me.”
Hernandez reflected on how he has learned over his career that whenever he’s in the room where decisions are happening, he has the daunting responsibility to have the courage to speak up, and that journalists have the responsibility to speak up.
“You have to speak up and challenge each other with love and respect,” Hernandez said. “Use your voice, no matter how shaky it may sound.”
Sisi Wei, chief impact officer of CalMatters and The Markup, shared that she has known Hernandez since  she was a journalism student trying to narrow down her interests.
“He was so supportive of journalism students everywhere, not simply those who had the pleasure of taking his classes,” Wei said. “He wanted everyone to experiment, to get opportunities, to push themselves, and to push the industry. And through his own work, he did just that.

As drought conditions worsen in Vermont, state officials are asking residents to report the impacts.
On Thursday, the Agency of Natural Resources encouraged Vermonters to communicate information on dry wells and water supplies, farm losses, crop damage, low water levels in rivers, lakes and recreational areas, and other issues related to water quality or availability.
These reports help the state assess the severity of the drought, identify where and what type of assistance is needed, and make plans to address drought impacts.

The U.S. Drought Monitor shows that almost 60% of Vermont is in severe drought conditions, up from 34% last week. When people report drought impacts to state officials, the data also informs the drought severity to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which can trigger action from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Internal Revenue Service to support Vermonters who may be significantly affected.
“There are actually six types of droughts, and we’re in all of them right now,” said state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, a geography professor at the University of Vermont and chair of the Vermont Drought Task Force.
“The one that is particularly concerning right now is the hydrological drought, which is when we look at how dry the lakes, ponds, streams, and wells and groundwater supplies are because that’s the one that had been at these record low levels even going back to last fall,” she said. The state is now experiencing both short- and long-term hydrological drought, she added.
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
Occasional rains or thunderstorms won’t be sufficient to reverse the current conditions, as some areas of Vermont have seen nearly 8 inches less rain than usual in the past four months, and the soil moisture level is 60% to 80% below average, Thursday’s press release by the Agency of Natural Resources states.
The drought task force, composed of state and federal representatives, continues to meet regularly to monitor the situation and provide new recommendations.
People can consult the agency’s drought resources for a list of contacts to report drought conditions. The task force also recommends reducing water consumption at home.
“Any sort of drought-related impact, I think it’s important for us to hear about so that we can start deploying the resources that need to be deployed as a response,” Dupigny-Giroux said.

Defense […],"Pictured is a Swadley's Bar-B-Q restaurant in Midwest City on Feb. 8, 2024. (Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A restaurant owner charged with defrauding the state is accusing Oklahoma’s attorney general of using a pending criminal case to bolster his gubernatorial bid.
Brent Swadley is seeking to have Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office removed from the case and to have a judge prohibit them from publicly speaking about it.
Defense attorneys argue Drummond has used his position to publicly declare Swadley guilty, predict his imprisonment and paint him as “a symbol of government corruption,” according to court filings.
But in court documents, Drummond argues the accusations and request for gag order amount to an unpermitted stall tactic to delay criminal proceedings. He denies wrongdoing.
In February 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted Ronald Brent Swadley, Curtis Ray Breuklander and Timothy Raymond Hooper with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state.
The charges stemmed from a controversial contract the state had with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen to operate restaurants in some state parks. Prosecutors allege the state was provided with false invoices, and a restaurant supplier was directed to fabricate invoices with inflated amounts.
Swadley is the company’s owner. Hooper served as the company’s chief operating officer and Breuklander is a former vice president. 
A spokesperson for Swadley’s said Hooper and Breuklander were no longer with the company.
The three men have denied wrongdoing. 
When reached for comment Friday, Drummond’s office pointed to court briefs filed in response. Drummond’s statements are allowable and a response to a media campaign by Swadley, the filing said. Swadley fails to present evidence the statements will prejudice the fact finding process, the response said.
In a motion, Drummond said Swadley is using an amended motion to disqualify “as a procedural weapon to delay these proceedings.” 
He wrote the court should deny both the gag order and removal requests because they’re attempts to delay the trial, which had been scheduled for November.
A judge pushed back the trial date over the state’s “strenuous objection.” It had not been rescheduled as of Friday.
Swadley’s attorney could not immediately comment on Drummond’s allegation about delaying the trial, a spokesperson said.
The state has also sued Swadley in civil court. Swadley has countersued.
Swadley’s filing accuses Drummond of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys.
Drummond’s remarks are also interfering with Swadley’s business relationships, the brief said.
“These statements, which were delivered at public events, on the campaign trail, in press releases, on social media and quoted in media articles, go far beyond permissible public information and strike at the heart of Swadley’s” right to a fair trial, the motion said.
Swadley says Drummond told a banker’s group in March that people who are wealthy and well connected in Oklahoma can break the law. He also said that Brent Swadley is going to go to prison for about eight years, according to filings.
A few weeks later, a bank to which Swadley had applied for a loan terminated his application, according to the filing.
In April, Drummond said Swadley “washed invoices” and took $6 million from the state, according to the motion.

‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

After detecting the invasive species first in 2023 and again in 2024, Idaho officials treated the river with a chemical to kill the mussels.
But officials with the Idaho State Department of Agriculture say the amount of the river in which quagga mussel larvae were detected this year, about 3.5 river miles, is 51% lower than last year’s range, which was 7.2 river miles. Officials say that is progress, and shows the agency’s treatment strategy is effective.
“Quagga mussels pose a serious threat to Idaho’s water infrastructure, ecosystems and economy,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said in a statement. “Full eradication remains the goal, but even reaching a level of containment is uncommon in other U.S. systems. (The agency’s) treatments are critical to prevent widespread impacts to agriculture, power generation and Idaho’s aquatic environments.”   
The announcement came two years after Idaho officials first found the invasive mussel species in the Snake River near Twin Falls in September 2023. 
This year’s detections are located near Shoshone Falls, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

 After copper-based chemical treatment in Snake River, Idaho officials planning ‘targeted treatment plan’ for this year

In response to detections in 2023 and 2024, officials and contractors applied a copper-based chemical called Natrix to the river, which is meant to kill the mussels but also kills fish. Officials also boosted other prevention and monitoring efforts, including water craft inspection sites and public education to clean water crafts.
The Idaho State Department of Agriculture is preparing a “targeted treatment plan” for this year, officials announced in a news release. 
The treatment will likely involve the copper-based chemical Natrix, “as it has been proven to be effective,” agency spokesperson Sydney Kennedy told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
The agency spent $1.5 million on Natrix in 2023 and $2.1 million in 2024, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In a joint statement, officials from the city of Twin Falls and the counties of Twin Falls and Jerome said their communities “are proud to stand alongside the Idaho State Department of Agriculture in this critical fight against quagga mussels.”
Thanks to the agency’s “swift action and expertise, the infestation has been contained to a small stretch of the Snake River, and we are encouraged by this progress. Protecting our waterways from quagga mussels is essential to our farms, residents and the entire Magic Valley community, and this partnership is key to safeguarding the future of our region,” read the statement by Twin Falls Mayor Ruth Pierce, Jerome County Commission Chairman Ben Crouch and Twin Falls County Commission Chairman Don Hall.
The State Department of Agriculture reports it has inspected roughly 159,000 water craft this year. 
In the area of the Snake River that is infested, officials say the agency conducted more than 450 samples out of more than 4,500 across the state.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island federal judge Friday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from awarding grants to applicants responding by a one-week deadline to a drastically revised notice for funding to build housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness.
HUD’s new notice issued Sept. 5 superseded a funding notice issued in May and served as yet another example of chaos unleashed by the Trump administration on the courts, U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy said at the Zoom hearing. The deadline for applications was 3 p.m. Friday, a half hour before the hearing began.
“It’s unfortunate that we are here on these things that are done so last minute by these agencies, but here we are,” McElroy told attorneys representing the plaintiffs in a case filed Thursday by attorneys for National Alliance to End Homelessness and Providence based Women’s Development Corporation (WDC).
Lawsuit over federal housing grants filed in Providence federal court

The plaintiffs are suing HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner over new eligibility criteria for applications for $75 million in Continuum of Care Build grants. They claim the new rules are unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people. The revised grant funding notice indicated that grants would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
Kristin Bateman, senior counsel with Democracy Forward, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued that the abrupt reissue of the funding notice violated the HUD Reform Act, which requires new funding opportunities to be issued with 30 days notice.
“Here there was a seven-day turnaround with no justification,” Bateman said.
Joshua Schopf, a trial attorney for the Department of Justice’s civil division, argued that the HUD secretary had 30 days to publish his reasons for waiving the standard notice with a federal register.
“This happened Sept. 5… he has until Oct. 6 to publish his reasons,” he said. “We haven’t violated procedure because it’s still ongoing.”
Bateman also took aim at the revised eligibility criteria that prohibit applicants from having policies supporting transgender people, which she said conflicts with existing federal law barring discrimination against non-cisgendered people.
“There’s no way someone could comply with those federal laws and this eligibility criteria treating sex as a binary thing,” she said.
“We’re not going to defend that particular condition,” Schopf told McElroy.
WDC had been informed in August by the office of U.S. Sen. Jack Reed that it would receive a $7 million Continuum of Care Build grant for a project to build 14 units for individuals escaping domestic violence in five new buildings in Providence’s West End. It had applied for the funding in May. But the nonprofit developer said it would be ineligible to apply for the new notice issued Sept. 5 since it has no control over the city or state’s stance on immigration and other policies nor could it reapply with only a one-week turnaround.
“The new conditions, if they’re precedent, you could argue that nobody in Rhode Island would be eligible if this applies to other grants,” WDC Executive Director Frank Shea told Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon.
Shea said he was pleased the court issued the restraining order and that the grant fund won’t go elsewhere for the time being. 
“That was the fear, it would be hard to undo,” he said.
During the hearing, McElroy said she was convinced that HUD’s new grant eligibility criteria caused irreparable harm.
“The irreparable harm is that these funds would be lost forever by anybody that intends to apply,” McElroy said.
“The court’s decision provides significant relief for communities in vulnerable circumstances and for the principle that federal housing funds exist to serve people in need, not to advance partisan goals,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a statement issued Friday just as the 54-minute hearing concluded. “The administration cannot unlawfully weaponize essential housing resources. We are proud to fight alongside our clients and partners as the case continues.”
The Trump administration now has 14 days to ask for a preliminary injunction. McElroy also tasked the DOJ with a briefing schedule and suggested hearings could be held in person in Providence instead of virtually if Shopf would like.
“Rhode Island’s lovely in the fall, not so much in February when it rains constantly,” she said.

The threats, which targeted the home and office of Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and the home of Majority Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), also prompted one school evacuation and a lockdown at City Hall. No explosives were found at any of the three locations, according to Santa Fe and state police departments. 
The bomb threats followed Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, and came amid similar threats across the country, including at numerous Historically Black Colleges and University campuses, leading to lockdowns and canceled classes. 
One of the emails was sent to the Santa Fe Mayor’s office, and is under investigation by Santa Fe Police. 
Mayor Alan Webber told Source NM in a phone call that he could not provide a copy of the threat emailed to his office Thursday, but said the email’s tone was “very matter of fact,” and contained no expletives.  
“In broad strokes, the email was describing what the sender was alleged to have put into the mailbox, and that it resembled a pipe bomb, how it had been constructed and essentially what the timetable was for doing harm,” Webber said. 
He told Source NM this kind of email was not common. 
“This is a fairly rare occurrence for people to make a threat like that in the first place, thankfully, or would think that the way to get it to the public or to the intended target is by sending an email to the mayor’s office,” he said. 
Webber said the day was already emotional, noting the anniversary of 9/11 and Kirk’s death – and said that he thought the timing of the threat was related to one or either of those events. 
“We’re all in this together and disagreeing is fine, but violence is never the solution,” he said. 
Webber said Santa Fe Police decided not to issue emergency alerts about the threats to prevent further threats to evacuated children, and noted that the affected streets were not “busy thoroughfares.” 
Santa Fe Police Deputy Chief Ben Valdez told Source NM the department acted out of caution, and to prevent the locations of school evacuations and pick-ups.   
“We don’t know if it is a legitimate threat or if it is a threat that is trying to solicit a response where now they expose students or faculty to danger,” he said. 
New Mexico State Police declined to make anyone available for an interview, but said in an email that the threats were emailed, and directed only at the specific lawmakers. Source NM has pending public records requests for the emails and police reports with both agencies.
State Police alerted Santa Fe police to the emailed threats, and was also in contact with the Legislative Council Service Director Shawna Casebier. 
Casebier, who is also the chief staff for the interim Capitol Security Subcommittee, told Source NM in a phone call that members met in closed session in June, Casebier said — following the assasination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband — and may meet again before the 2026 January session. 
“Regardless of what happens in other states or in the national landscape, capital security, security of legislators, staff, public, in the building is of the highest priority and concern,” Casebier said. “We are constantly evaluating to ensure that the security protocols and infrastructure are appropriate to address concerns.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WirthReena-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-09-12 17:58:03.387932

Joe Lombardo said at a Friday press conference.
The governor said the “bad actor” involved is believed to have received “information through our internal system, not public based or distinct personal information. It’s information on data that is endemic to state processes or state inventory or state databases.”
He added, “Right now, the breadth of that has been identified.”
Lombardo said he could not provide specific details, echoing past press conferences where he has emphasized that the investigation is ongoing and that state and federal officials must balance transparency with security.
When asked about the motive of the attack, the governor responded, “Well, obviously it’s a ransom, right? To achieve monetary gain as a goal.”
Lombardo did not provide any details of the ransom or whether it has been paid.
Lombardo said 90% of state public-facing websites are back online.
 
Information on the current status of various state services can be found at oem.nv.gov/recovery.


Of those that remain down, the state is prioritizing “public safety and consistent impact,” he added. Among services still down: background checks needed for certain people attempting to buy firearms, the state’s victim notification system, and the sex offender registry lookup.
“While we are not yet at the finish line, we are moving there faster than expected,” added Lombardo.
Lombardo said the state received 150 million hits to its firewall in the 72 hours after his first press conference — 300% more than it typically receives.
He also said phishing attempts spiked after recent news reports about the state forcing all state employees to reset security credentials and passwords.
Lombardo highlighted the incidents while making a point about the need to withhold information about the technical details and nature of the cyber attack.
The governor expressed support for a legislative cybersecurity working group announced by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager earlier this week.
“I would support any endeavor by the Legislature to identify some sort of solution to help us in this endeavor,” he said, adding that it could involve hardware, software or monetary solutions. “In my opinion, [it] has risen to an emergency, and I think it’s necessary that we address it sooner than later.”
Details on that working group are forthcoming, according to a press release from the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus.

U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, and his wife stand behind Rollins. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)YUKON — With no active cases of New World screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working to prevent its spread from Central America, a Trump administration official said Friday. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins outlined the Department of Agriculture’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm to the United States, including a partnership with the government of Mexico, during a stop at Express Ranches in Oklahoma. 
New World screwworm is a fly that lays eggs in the wounds of living animals and its larvae burrow and feed on healthy flesh, causing illness or death. The insect usually infects livestock and is typically found in South and Central America, but one case was detected in a human this summer who had returned from travel to El Salvador. 
“President Trump’s America First agenda means our (agricultural) community deserves unwavering support in the face of critical threats like this one,” she said. “As the situation evolves, we will continue our efforts to keep vulnerable livestock ranchers and the rest of America safe. The U.S. has defeated the New World screwworm before, and we will do it again.”
Earlier this sumer there was a confirmed case of screwworms in Mexico about 370 miles from the U.S. border, south of Texas. The USDA halted live cattle crossing at the border and got “really serious” about preventing the spread, Rollins said. 
No cases of screwworm have been detected in livestock in the United States. 
“So again, we’ve got plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, but we are not messing around with any of them,” Rollins said. “We are getting fully prepared at every single level for whatever comes.”
The USDA’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm includes investments of up to $100 million for innovations to find new ways to combat the insect and $750 million to create a facility in south Texas to sterilize flies and combat the spread. 
Releasing sterile flies was a technique used to eradicate the pest in the 1960s to disrupt the reproduction of screwworms and is being used again today. The hope is that those sterile flies will then mate with wild ones, producing infertile eggs, experts said. 
Another $21 million is being invested to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, to produce more sterile flies.

Rollins estimated the facility in Mexico will be functioning again in the coming months, but the Texas facility will take 12 to 18 months to produce. Combined, these facilities will produce up to 400 million additional sterile flies per week. 
Agents from the USDA will also monitor the U.S.-Mexico border as “Tick Riders” along with dogs to detect infested livestock, Rollins said. 
In order to prevent screwworm from crossing the southern border, the U.S. partnered with Mexico. Mexico has waived duties on eradication equipment being sent across the border and allowed for the U.S. to complete aerial drops of sterile flies, Rollins said. 
“I’ve only been on the job about seven or eight months, but many have said that our partnership with Mexico right now is as strong and as transparent as it has been in decades,” she said. 
The USDA will also inspect animals and carcasses for signs of New World screwworm infection to protect the country’s food supply. 
Screwworm was more widespread in the United States in the 1960s, but it was later eradicated. 
U.S. Representative Frank Lucas, R-Oklahoma, said it’s a “critical battle” to prevent screwworms from reaching the United States again. 
“The battle on new world screwworms [is] the chief threat we face in the livestock industry,” he said. “I was too young to remember it firsthand, but I listened to my late father and grandfather talk about going out every day all summer long with a bottle of stuff to paint newborns’ navels and treat every wound on an animal. I’ve listened to my old retired game warden point out to me that before these were eradicated in the 60s, we had dramatically fewer deer and other wildlife because they attack all animals.”

(Photo for Kentucky Lantern by Sarah Ladd)A Kentucky judge has declined to issue a preliminary injunction in a case challenging a new state law that blocks the use of public funds for inmates’ elective medical treatments and takes 67 transgender inmates off hormone therapy. 
U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove said in his Friday ruling that the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which is representing an incarcerated person, “has not shown at this preliminary stage a constitutional violation that warrants enjoining the enforcement.” 
Court documents say the ACLU’s client, Maddilyn Marcum, was “diagnosed with gender dysphoria and placed on HRT five years prior” to incarceration. HRT refers to hormone replacement therapy. The ruling says that the client was ineligible to receive HRT post sentencing due to not being on it when entering Department of Corrections custody.  
“This decision is disappointing, but we will continue to litigate our case on behalf of Ms. Marcum and all transgender people who are incarcerated in Kentucky.” Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement. “We will continue to demonstrate to the court how this cruel policy violates our clients’ right to receive medically necessary healthcare.”
Ban on public funds  for KY prisoners’ transgender care becomes law without Beshear’s signature

The ACLU is challenging Senate Bill 2 from the 2025 legislative session, saying it violates the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment. 
The law, a high priority in the Republican-controlled legislature, says public dollars cannot be used to fund a “cosmetic service or elective procedure” for Kentucky inmates. It also says if a health care provider documents that ending a treatment would harm an inmate, use of the drug or hormone may be “systematically reduced and eliminated.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, let it become law without his signature. 
The case will continue, an ACLU spokeswoman said. This ruling means the law will be in effect as the case makes its way through the courts.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers, economists and community leaders met in Augusta on Friday to begin a new approach to address Maine’s property tax burden. 
While there is bipartisan agreement that the burden is too high, the Legislature held off on any substantial reform this past session to first convene a task force to holistically study the issue.
The initial meeting of what will ultimately be a two-year study of the issue largely consisted of an overview of the current property tax structure and assistance programs. However, discussions already indicated a range of ideas, such as reevaluating current non-taxable properties and exemptions as well as looking to other states for possible answers. 
For example, Rhode Island added a tax on non-owner-occupied properties assessed at $1 million or more, what is being referred to by some as the “Taylor Swift tax” because the singer has a vacation home on Watch Hill, said Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and a nonvoting member of the task force.
Republican Sen. Bruce Bickford of Androscoggin pointed to the Florida Constitution authorizing its Legislature to allow counties and municipalities to grant exemptions to certain people who are 65 years old or over. 
The ultimate goal of the Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force — which has 13 voting and two nonvoting members — is to determine the source of the problems with the current system of property taxation, identify who is most negatively affected by the current system and how those people are impacted.
An interim report detailing preliminary findings and recommendations is due to the Legislature’s Taxation Committee by Jan. 15. A final report, including suggested legislation, is due by Dec. 15, 2026. The group has to meet at least four times but no more than eight, though that doesn’t include subcommittee meetings. The next meeting has yet to be determined. 
Legislators suggest task force tackle challenge of property tax reform

What’s been tried?
The state has made several changes to try to address the property tax burden over the years. 
The state budget has taken on a lot of that responsibility, Allen said, pointing to Maine only recently meeting its requirement to fund 55% of K-12 municipal costs, which have been rising. 
The state has also added new assistance programs, though some not for long. 
In 2024, lawmakers expanded eligibility to the Property Tax Fairness Credit — which provides refunds for property taxes or rent paid. The cost of this credit to the state has gone from $15 million in 2018 to a projected $100 million in this fiscal year, according to Allen. 
That expansion, as well as the creation of a Property Tax Deferral Program, in 2024 was meant to soften the blow from the short-lived Property Tax Stabilization Program that allowed older Mainers to freeze their property taxes. 
The Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
Lawmakers considered a host of changes earlier this year, including several Republican proposals to reinstate the stabilization program, which were ultimately rejected. Proposals to collect extra taxes on short-term rentals also failed. 
Other bills are being carried over into the next session, which begins in January. Some of those plans include expanding the Property Tax Fairness Credit, expanding property tax assistance for veterans and their survivors and increasing the state’s tax exemption for homeowners. 
Many of these suggestions would tweak existing programs, such as the Homestead Property Tax Exemption, which provides a reduction for property tax purposes of up to $25,000 from the value of a home for those eligible. 
“Are those programs achieving the aims that they originally set out to?” asked task force member Vinnie Caliendo, president of the wholesaler Native Maine Produce and Specialty Foods. “Are any of them being either abused and not benefiting the right parties in the way that was the original intention or, conversely, are they and could they be enhanced so they do so better?”
Bipartisan efforts to expand property tax exemptions face pushback from Mills administration

Current factors
Property taxes have long been a concern in Northeast states, which tend to rely more significantly on them for revenue to fund public institutions such as schools. But Allen said during the Friday meeting that the burden of such taxes has become more of an issue across the country since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s not just that the value is going up,” Allen said. “It’s that the value on residential is increasing [while] commercial property values were declining, so more of the burden of the taxes is being pushed onto residential properties.” 
Maine was hit harder than some other states because a lot of people moved into the state during the pandemic, he added.  
Allen also provided context to recent reports that have ranked Maine as a state with the highest property tax burden. 
If all property taxes in the state are divided by the population, Maine lands around the tail end of the top ten. If all property taxes are divided by personal income, that rank moves up. Allen says the latter is problematic because Maine residents don’t pay all property taxes. That calculation doesn’t factor in wealthy people who have second homes in the state. 
Historically Maine has topped census lists of the percentage of housing units vacant because they are used as second homes, with northern New England neighbors closely following. 
“We’re an outlier, and again, if you’re just going to take those total properties and divide them by our personal income — this is one reason why we’re going to be number one,” Allen said. “We’re Vacationland.” 
But Allen clarified, that doesn’t mean Maine doesn’t have high property taxes. 
Right now, possible increases in valuations are worrying many across the state.  
“The thing that seems to get people that I’ve talked to in my community wound up is the change in value,” said task force member Robert Nutting, the Republican representative of Oakland. 
Many towns are now getting caught back up with delayed revaluations that reflect post-pandemic jumps in residential property value. 
Increased assessments don’t necessarily mean higher property taxes, rather they determine the proportion each property owner pays of a town’s taxes. Typically this means while some residents will see higher taxes, others will see them lowered, and some will see them remain the same. 
How are property taxes determined in Maine?
Property taxes are how municipalities in Maine raise money. The money mostly goes toward three buckets: county, schools and municipal expenses. In most towns, schools constitute the majority. 
If a town wants to raise money, assessment changes must be approved by a public vote. Tax rate is then determined by dividing the amount to be raised by total taxable value. 
Under the Maine Constitution, property tax must be assessed at its “just value,” which courts have interpreted to mean fair market value. This just value clause is one of the most consequential provisions in the property tax world, according to Peter Lacy, director of the property tax division in Maine Revenue Services and a non-voting task force member. 
“There is a fair amount of discretion for assessors in determining what just value means,” Lacey said, “but it is, at least in theory, a somewhat stable value.”
Municipalities must also follow the assessing standards outlined in state law. For example, one requirement is that the total local valuation of taxable property can’t fall below 70% of fair market value. 
If the state Legislature passes a statutory exemption, the state is on the hook to reimburse at least 50% of the tax loss. If the Legislature requires additional municipal work for a new program, then the state is required to reimburse municipalities for at least 90% of the cost of that additional work.
Those will have to be among the many factors the task force considers in determining its recommendations.

After the pandemic, inflation and cost of housing made starting to teach in Montana very difficult.
But a new program, passed by the 2025 Legislature, has already boosted starting teacher pay and kept districts from struggling with open positions, according to school leaders. In fact, the program has become so successful that nearly every district has been able to leverage it to help retain early-career teachers.
But it was House Bill 252, Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act, or “STARS,” passed by the 2025 Legislature, that helped boost the starting pay. For districts, it meant a stretch of the budget: The new law says that for districts to qualify for the funding, the starting teacher salary must be 62% of the district-wide average. This helps teachers get to the average level more quickly.
During the Legislature, teachers told of not being able to teach school without a second job, or struggling to find housing even somewhat affordable. A look at most national metrics showed Montana hovered somewhere near the bottom of the nation when it came to starting-teacher salaries — below most nearby states.
For years, Montana had been accused of favoring mid- and later-career teachers at the expense of newly minted professionals. Most districts rejected that notion, but said that unions and schools had more teachers with experience pushing for competitive wages while teachers who were dissatisfied left quickly, leaving fewer voices to advocate to unions and school districts to raise the minimum. Moreover, routine annual raises of 2% to 3%, during the course of a teaching career compounded to better salaries in the cycle of raises, meaning that those who had made it past the first few lean years of teaching salaries were more likely to see an affordable wage.
Erwin Garcia, the superintendent of Billings Public Schools, the largest public school district in the state, said that his district was seeing as many as 100 teachers per year leaving. He noted that not all of the pressure was coming from the pay.
“Most people referred to the mental health of students and the behavior,” Garcia said.
And statistics bear that out: The district recorded the number of times a student struck a teacher — in 2013, the number was zero; last year, it was 33. Eighty-eight percent of those instances were in elementary school, with many being in kindergarten. Garcia believes what children are experiencing at home is brought into a classroom, and teachers begin to modify and teach better behavior.
 Lance Melton, the chief executive officer of the Montana School Boards Association, gave an example of how the new program works. He said Kalispell’s starting pay was 56% of the average salary, so the base salary was increased by roughly 6% for new teachers. He said the goal is for the starting salary to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of average pay for districts to retain the most staff. He said the program has given districts the flexibility to scale their own pay scale, because, for example, the base cost of living in Bozeman or Missoula may be different than Billings or Miles City.
Melton also said that previous efforts looked at the average teacher salary, but that often ignored the base salary, meaning it was harder to recruit and retain teachers.
Garcia said the Billings district did other things to help the school year, including trimming some programs in order to fund fully priorities. For example, one other item Billings Public Schools tried is shortening the school year by increasing the teacher-pupil instruction time. In other words, the length of the school day extended, but the number of days shortened, making it more attractive to teachers as well as parents who want a longer summer break.
Even since the program was implemented, the number of vacancies dropped in Billings from 100 to 30.
While Billings had to stretch to make the budget work, Garcia said all districts in Montana and beyond are struggling, the smaller raises were not keeping pace with the cost of living. The STARS program brings the base level up.
“So when we were giving the teachers a raise, we were not just doing them a favor, we were being fair because $40,000 in 2020 is not what $40,000 is in 2025. What we were really giving, as a district, was being eaten up by inflation,” Garcia said.
He said getting starting teachers earning more is also a quality-of-life-issue: He said he knew teachers working an extra job after school and one on weekends.
“It’s pretty depressing if you have to work a second or a third job. Your quality-of-life is diminished,” Garcia said.
Melton said that the Legislature was able to thread the fine needle between state help and local control. While the state doesn’t mandate any district use STARS, almost every district has in order to bring starting salaries up. He sees that as the surest sign of success.
Montana’s demographics also make it difficult, Melton said. In 1996, public schools had 165,000 kids enrolled — roughly 17.4% of the population. Since then, the overall population has grown, but the number of school-aged children has dropped, causing the percentage to shrink to just above 14%. Those percentages may not sound drastic, but that’s an 11% decrease, and funding is figured on a per-student basis.
Melton said the decline in students hasn’t necessarily meant that districts could cut 11% their budgets because of inflation and overhead costs. As an example, a classroom of 23 where three students leave, means a loss of more than $25,000 for the district, but the resources needed, including a teacher, will not decrease by the same amount.
If Montana’s school-aged demographics had simply kept pace, Montana would have nearly 217,000 students enrolled in public schools. While the population decline is substantial, the amount of money schools get has also decreased.
“When COVID came along, it was an inflection point because we were already behind and then we fell behind because of inflation,” Melton said. “COVID relief funds kind of masked it, but we were already falling behind.”
He said the new increases help put districts back in a position to be competitive.
“This helps with attrition, gives teachers a better of vision of having a comfortable lifestyle,” Melton said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-525409577-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

(Photo courtesy of WEDC)Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Secretary and CEO Missy Hughes will step down from her position in the Evers Administration on Sept. 19, according to a Friday announcement. 
Hughes was first appointed to the position in 2019 and was confirmed by the state Senate in 2021 and in 2023. She is the first woman to serve in the position. Prior to that, she served as general counsel and chief mission officer at La Farge dairy cooperative, Organic Valley.
Hughes thanked Evers in a statement for “his vision and support for our efforts to build an economy for all.” 
“Each of our state’s successes serves to inspire more development, more innovation, and more growth,” Hughes said. “People start seeing something good happening in their communities, and they want to keep it moving forward. Opportunities to be in the national news for positive accomplishments show companies and talent that Wisconsin competes on the global stage. Every day, Wisconsin is solving problems for the world, and we’ve made sure the world has us on its mind. I’m incredibly grateful to have been a part of this work and the Evers Administration.”
According to Evers’ office, WEDC during Hughes’ tenure has worked with companies to commit over $8 billion in planned investments and to create or retain over 45,000 jobs. 
Hughes’ departure comes as she considers a run for governor in 2026, in the first open race since 2010, though she made no indication of her future plans in her statement. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to run so he can spend time with his family has left a lane for Democratic leaders across the state to consider a run. So far, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez entered the race first and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley launched his campaign this week. Others considering include state Sen. Kelda Roys, Attorney General Josh Kaul and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
Evers said Hughes has played an important role in his administration’s focus on “building an economy that works for everyone, investing in Wisconsin’s homegrown talent and Main Streets, and supporting and expanding some of our state’s most iconic brands and companies while attracting new industries and opportunities here to Wisconsin.”

(Courtesy Bill Banowsky/ ""A Savage Art"")When political cartoonist and Australia native Pat Oliphant won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1967 — just a few years after moving to the United States — he wasn’t pleased. He didn’t like the cartoon that won and, as such, didn’t enter the contest again and used his platform to criticize the Pulitzer Board. 
Oliphant’s refusal to hold any person or institution beyond reproach can be seen in most if not all of the more than 10,000 cartoons he’s created over the course of a career spanning 10 presidents, by way of measure. A new documentary, “A Savage Art: The Life & Cartoons of Pat Oliphant,” captures the independent mind behind the work. 

 Pat Oliphant cartoons 








OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA
























































The New York Times notes in its positive review of the recently opened film that even people unfamiliar with Oliphant’s name have probably seen his cartoons. But at least one person wasn’t as familiar with his work before he met Oliphant personally: Bill Banowsky, the documentary’s director. Both Banowsky and Oliphant, now 90 and suffering from macular degeneration and glaucoma, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is how they met, after Banowsky and his wife moved to the city about 10 years ago. 
“I didn’t really know a whole lot about his cartooning until I met him, and then we became fast friends after that,” Banowsky, who has a background as a film producer, lawyer and movie theater owner, told Source NM.
The film also delves into the history of political cartooning, and its intersection with politics and journalism. “A Savage Art” is currently playing in Santa Fe at Banowsky’s movie house, Sky Cinemas, and will be showing in theaters across the country starting Sept. 12 and into the fall. The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
Source: Were you a fan or buff of political cartoons in general before you met Pat Oliphant?
Bill Banowsky: Not particularly. I think I really kind of came to appreciate the importance of political cartooning as a form of satire, because I am very interested in politics and incredibly disturbed by what is happening in our political world. It’s more disturbing now than in my entire lifetime, and I’m somewhat obsessed about that. The work Pat did and the work great cartoonists are doing today to highlight the outrageous things our government is doing…is needed because the Democrats aren’t meeting the moment in the way that I think an opposition party could and should. So, having this additional line of defense, if you will, is important, and I’m glad that there’s still good work being done. 
Pat Oliphant drew more than 10,000 political cartoons, and won the Pultizer Prize for editorial cartoons in 1967. (Film still/courtesy Bill Banowsky)
How did you approach profiling an artist you admire but also thinking about what his work represents?
Pat was not partisan. One of my favorite cartoons is shown in the very early part of the intro section, and it shows Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty —these two big Humpty Dumpties are identical. One has a T-shirt that says Democrat and one says Republican, and they’re just hugging each other. And this guy asks Alice, ‘Do you know who you’re going to vote for?’ 
I think that really represents Pat’s feeling about partisan politics. He was as brutal toward Bill Clinton as he was toward Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. My feeling in terms of what we wanted to impart in this film is: He’s opposed to greed and to avarice and to overreach and to bad behavior, regardless of who it’s coming from. 
Now, if he were working today, he would be working overtime, because we’ve never seen such greed and avarice and overreach and bad behavior as we’re seeing now. We are, I think, in  uncharted waters. But if you look over the history of his work, going back from [Lyndon B. Johnson] to [Donald Trump], you’ll see that he wasn’t partisan. And he really just touched on Trump — he was losing his eyesight by the time Trump was elected the first time around. Some of the Trump cartoons we have in our film actually are from 2011/ 2012 and [Barack] Obama was president, but Trump was on the stage…and ever the fool. And so he did characterize him in some cartoons back then. But what I love about Pat is his integrity in his work. He called a spade a spade, and it didn’t matter whether it was a Democrat or Republican.
Do you think that approach would work in today’s environment?
No, I think he would be a little bit more brutal toward the Republicans in today’s environment. I don’t think there’s any question about it. He would also point out how feckless the Democrats are. And he did point out how they anointed Hillary Clinton. And then they just did it again with Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. A lot of the problems we’re in right now are the results of the choices of the Democratic Party, and allowing those decisions to be made as they have against the will of the Bernie Sanders’ element of the Democratic Party.

Does the film, then, have a call to action?
I hope so. We want to be part of the resistance to all of the authoritarian impulses that are flowing through our society in our politics right now. We want to inspire people to say no. We want to inspire people to get their voice out in whatever ways they can to stand up to horrible behavior.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oliphantsupremecourt-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Caraveo was elected in 2022 as the first-ever representative for the 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County and is the state’s most competitive.
Other Democrats left in the race include state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster, state Treasurer Dave Young, and Amie Baca-Oehlert, former head of the Colorado Education Association. The Democratic primary election will be in June 2026.

Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places as he began a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection.","Congressman John B. Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places Friday as he arrived in a union hall in East Hartford to begin a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection: At 77, Larson faces his first serious challenge for the Democratic nomination since winning an open seat in 1998.
Campaign kickoffs are theatrical pieces, and Larson’s featured themes of loyalty, experience and seniority — attributes that made challenges unthinkable in other years in Connecticut, a state historically hostile to primaries against incumbent Democrats.
As the congressman stepped to a microphone on a crowded riser to formally become the fifth Democrat to declare their candidacy in the 1st Congressional District, a snippet of a 1970s pop hit played: “We’re still having fun, and you’re still the one.”
Both notions have been tested this summer. Four challengers, including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, opened campaigns that found no fault with Larson’s liberal, pro-labor voting record but insisted the time had come for new leadership in a struggling Democratic Party.
Larson ignored his challengers to focus on a desire to return to Washington for a 29th and 30th year to fight President Donald Trump on immigration, gun control, student debt, health care, women’s rights, climate and the congressman’s favorite issue, the preservation of Social Security.
“It’s time for Democrats to unite and stand together, because we’re in a fight. You know it, and I know it. So I ask you, are you ready for a fight?” Larson said, pausing briefly for the certain affirmative answer. Smiling, he added, “I officially announce my campaign for congressman from the First District.”
He promised action on his agenda in the first 100 days after Democrats retake the majority in the House, though Republicans would still control the White House and  most likely the Senate.
East Hartford is home to Larson and his large extended family. He began his career more than 45 years ago as a school board member, then was elected to the council and state Senate. His brother, Tim, is a former mayor and state senator. He grew up in Mayberry Village, public housing.
The current mayor, Connor Martin, once worked at Goodwin University for another Larson brother, Dan Larson. And Larson was introduced by his niece, Arianna Larson. To launch the campaign, he chose a familiar setting, the International Association of Machinists hall across the street from Pratt & Whitney.
“The thing about a big family and loyal friends — when you attack one of us, you attack all of us, and we stick together,” Larson said.
An old friend, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, sat in the front row near Joe Suggs, a retiree who competed with Larson for the congressional seat in the 1998 primary. Kevin Sullivan, a former state Senate leader and lieutenant governor, also came to show support, as did former state Sen. Eric Coleman. Sullivan and Coleman are in their 70s. Clyburn is 85.

Martin, the mayor, turns 34 next week. He said the congressman and two of his brothers have been mentors.
“His story is not very different than mine, and probably many of us in the room, growing up in public housing, right? Not having generational wealth, right?” Martin said. “His family, having to work two to three jobs to take care of their family is a common story in America, especially with middle class America.”
Larson called out the two establishment figures at the top of his campaign: the chair is Daniel Papermaster, a lawyer and former aide to two former senators, Chris Dodd and Joseph Lieberman; and the finance chair is Alan Lazowski, a wealthy philanthropist and chief executive of Laz Parking.
Lazowski was a key supporter of Bronin’s in Hartford.
“But John has been a dear friend for over 40 years, and he’s always delivered for our district, for all 27 towns, for Hartford,” Lazowski said. “And I believe that he’s the right leader we need to get things done. His seniority in Congress is unparalleled, and you can’t just come in as a freshman and have an impact.”
Lazowski said he tried to talk Bronin out of running, and he dismissed concerns about Larson’s age. His father, Rabbi Phillip Lazowski, is 95 and working on his 16th book.
“He works harder than anyone I know, and John has that spirit,” Lazowski said.

Joe Toner, the executive director of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, which represents 30,000 union construction workers, said the council already has Larson, an old friend. 
“He’s been by our side for the last 27 years, 28 years, and that’s not going to change. He’s never been a bad vote for us in the building trades. Quite frankly, he’s never been a bad vote for the district,” Toner said. “So we’re honored to support him. We’re going to stick with him. This is no time to make a change.”
Ruth Fortune, 37, a Hartford school board member, filed campaign papers July 3 and was quickly followed by Councilman Jack Perry, 35, of Southington. By the end of August, the field included Bronin, 46, and the 43-year-old Gilchrest.
On Friday, Bronin said Larson’s announcement was evidence that time has passed him by. Pledging action in 100 days on an agenda he cannot deliver was wrongheaded, Bronin said.
“While I have an enormous amount of respect for John Larson, I don’t think John Larson recognizes the moment that we’re in,” Bronin said. “Voters don’t want empty promises. They don’t want to be misled. Voters want to see that we recognize that if we’re going to deliver the things that our country needs, we have to build a different kind of political movement.”
Bronin waited to talk to reporters at a riverside park in East Hartford after Larson’s event. Gilchrest offered a similar critique in an emailed statement, expressing admiration and a demand for a change.
“I’m not running for Congress as a referendum on John Larson — I’m running because Congress as a whole isn’t listening to the voices of everyday people and has failed to deliver the change families need,” she said. “We can’t keep expecting the same people to do better next time.”
“Our families deserve a representative who will meet this moment with urgency and deliver real solutions — as I’ve done here in Connecticut on paid leave, gun safety and reproductive freedom. We can’t wait any longer.”
Larson left the union hall for a fundraising lunch at Cafe Aura, the Manchester restaurant owned by Geno Auriemma. Larson reported having less than $300,000 in his campaign account as of June 30. Bronin reported raising $500,000 in his first week.
The next campaign finance reporting period is in October.

(Photo by Jeff T. Green/Getty Images)The federal government is unenthusiastic about cranking up its biggest cleanup project next month at the Hanford nuclear site in south-central Washington. But it will meet an Oct. 15 deadline to bring the so-called glassification facility online, the U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday. 
Whether the department may move later to shut down the facility, which will be used to turn radioactive waste into glass, is still hazy.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., talked with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Wednesday about earlier reports the Department of Energy wanted to back out of firing up the long-delayed Hanford plant by Oct. 15 and go to an undefined alternate method to neutralize 56 million gallons of radioactive waste.
That waste is stored in 177 leak-prone underground tanks in the center of the Hanford nuclear reservation and is at risk of seeping into the Columbia River.
Wright acknowledged to Murray that he wants to stall work on, or possibly eliminate, a completed facility to convert 20 million to 25 million gallons of the least radioactive tank wastes (dubbed “low-activity wastes”) into a benign glass. The process involves mixing the wastes and glass flakes and melting them together.
The department’s Thursday statement and Wright’s discussion with Murray contain ambiguous statements that, while promising glassification will begin by Oct 15, do not rule out the Department of Energy switching directions later. 
Murray’s office acknowledged these ambiguities and said the Department of Energy still needs to answer many questions to clarify its intentions and thought processes. In its statement, the Department of Energy’s Washington, D.C. headquarters did not address the Washington State Standard’s questions about the lack of clarity.
“I need to see real evidence that this administration is moving forward on our decades-long effort to turn nuclear waste into glass at Hanford. I also need an explanation for the conflicting information I have gotten from the Department over the last 48 hours—and I need the Deputy Secretary to sign off on key documents so the completion of hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant can move forward,” Murray said in a statement on Friday morning.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, in a written statement Thursday, said that if the federal government backs away from its glassification plans at the site, it would be a “stunning waste of resources, a violation of multiple legal agreements and a slap in the face to the workers who have brought us to this point.”
“We will be challenging this decision. There’s too much at stake for the people of Washington and our environment,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson planned to discuss the issue further at a press conference on Friday afternoon in Kennewick.
On Wednesday, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the situation, including preparing to leap in if the federal government tries to stray from its legal obligations on this project.
Washington State Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said he’d seen news reports and heard from Murray’s office that the federal government has decided to abandon its efforts to commission the waste treatment plant. 
“If these reports are accurate, it would violate legally binding agreements,” Sixkiller said. “We are now just days away from beginning to treat low-activity radioactive waste at Hanford, and any delay or change in plans would threaten years of work and billions of dollars in investments.”
‘I am not satisfied’ 
Murray said that Wright “admitted to me during a phone call that the Department of Energy is planning to curb hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant at Hanford — an astonishingly senseless and destructive move and a threat to the entire nuclear cleanup mission at Hanford.”
The secretary’s comments, Murray said, didn’t track with “positive news” from the lead contractor on the project, Bechtel, that safety reviews and technical tests for one of the waste treatment melters were completed, and the facility was on track to begin operating next month.
“Not only has this facility already been built, but commissioning is ahead of schedule. Secretary Wright claimed that moving forward with hot commissioning is an issue of safety, but records do not corroborate his assertion,” Murray added. 
Wright did not elaborate to Murray about the nature of the safety issue. The Department of Energy did not reply Thursday to emailed questions on this and other matters.
“Whether Secretary Wright was given bad information or is simply confused about how the (glassification) facility works, I can’t say, but I am not satisfied by his explanation for why DOE has suddenly decided to stall progress on the Waste Treatment Plant,” Murray said.
Murray also said she’d put a hold on the nomination of Tim Walsh to oversee Hanford.
Walsh is Wright’s intended replacement for Roger Jarrell, who was fired Monday from his position as principal deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management, which oversees Hanford’s cleanup. 
Politico E&E reported that Wright wants to replace Jarrell with Walsh as part of a move to take Hanford’s cleanup in a different direction.
Decades of cleanup still ahead 
Hanford has been looking at glassifying its tank wastes since the 1990s. 
It began construction in 2002, with the first glassification plant legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years before it actually will. This first plant is supposed to take care of 40 to 50 percent of the tanks’ “low-activity” wastes. 
The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants plus a third to handle the site’s 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive tank wastes. 
The entire project’s original budget in 2002 was $4 billion. This has grown to roughly $30 billion. The first low-activity waste plant cost slightly more than $9 billion. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by a frequently modified 35-year-old legal contract among the Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state ecology department, plus some federal court decrees — meaning the cleanup schedules and standards are legally locked in. 
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. 
That development work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive wastes, the worst 56 million gallons of which were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
The tanks are considered the worst radiological contamination problem in the Western Hemisphere. 
Hanford’s current legal target calls for glassifying all wastes by 2052. The Department of Energy has internally moved those targets back to 2069, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office. 
After four years of closed-door negotiation, the Department of Energy, the EPA and the state agreed to try encasing the contents of 22 tanks in grout, which is a cement-like substance.
The Government Accountability Office has been bullish on the grout idea. 
Since 2017, the watchdog agency has issued three reports strongly recommending that the Department of Energy look at replacing the second low-activity-waste glassification plant with a plan to grout the roughly 50 percent of low-activity wastes not handled by the first low-activity plant. Grouting is theoretically a faster and cheaper option.
Washington officials have always been skeptical about grout, citing its lacking of track record with the types of wastes found in Hanford’s tanks. The Department of Energy has been mum in the past about its preferences.
The 2024 agreement calls for grouting to be used on low-activity wastes found in 22 tanks that also contain high-level wastes. A decision on grouting technology — which will then lead to budgeting and scheduling — is due by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, all 149 single-shell tanks and the majority of the 28 double-shell tanks are way past their design lives. So far, only one double-shell tank has sprung a leak, in its inner wall, and thus can no longer be used. 
Roughly one-third of the single-shell tanks are confirmed leakers and cannot be used to store wastes. At least 1 million gallons have leaked into the ground, with some already reaching the Columbia River seven miles away. 
If leaks occur in more double-shell tanks, that could delay glassification by several years and create further problems. It would take seven years and $1.5 billion, the Government Accountability Office has reported, to build four 1-million-gallon double-shell tanks.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/radioactive-waste-sign-hanford-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Despite a last-minute scramble, California Senate leaders failed to fix an environmental law rollback for advanced manufacturing, leaving pollution concerns untouched as session ends. 


In June, California Democrats rushed to significantly roll back the state’s landmark environmental law to clear the path for land development.
Environmental justice advocates weren’t happy. Because of changes signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, certain developments now are exempt from environmental reviews, which advocates fear will cut out tribal community feedback, threaten endangered species and lead to more pollution for some of the state’s most at-risk residents. Facing backlash, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire promised a fix.
“That is an issue that we’re going to need to continue to focus on in the weeks and months to come before we leave this session in September,” McGuire told his fellow senators in June.
He’s now run out of time. With just hours until the legislative session ends, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and McGuire have not agreed on how to meaningfully address those environmental concerns, punting the discussion to the fall. 
“This is a complex policy issue and we must get [it] right for Californians,” said Nick Miller, a spokesperson for Rivas, when asked why the talks stalled. “Our assessment is it needs to go through a public process with input and discussion.”
The differences laid bare the growing rift between the pro-development Assembly, which has pushed to cut red tape to build more housing faster, and the Senate, which has been more skeptical about private development without labor and environmental protections. 
The lack of progress has angered environmental justice advocates and lawmakers, who said the leaders failed to make good on their promises. 
“To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat who was among 35 lawmakers to urge legislative leaders to fix the law in August. “Several of us have asked to have this fixed, and we were told that it was going to get fixed, and now we’re here and we’re told that it’s not.” 
This week, California leaders negotiated and released a budget-related bill to implement the June updates with minimal changes. But the Senate’s budget committee shelved the bill Wednesday amid senators’ criticism that it didn’t go far enough to regulate pollution, and environmental groups called the bill “premature and harmful.” 
‘To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement.’Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat
In a symbolic move, Senate leaders announced Wednesday a separate, last-minute measure to reinstate environmental review requirements for some high-polluting manufacturing plants within 300 feet of homes and schools, despite knowing it did not have time to pass this year. 
“We thought it was really important for the public to see that when we made that commitment, we meant it. That we were not just talking about it,” said Senate Budget Committee Chair Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and a major champion of the environmental review exemptions and housing construction. 
“We would prefer to do it now,” he added. “But we need a three-party agreement to do anything.”
That going-nowhere proposal did not satisfy environmental groups. High-polluting plants have the potential to harm residents far beyond 300 feet, which amounts to half a city block, said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Adding to the chaos, Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat, on Friday introduced an uber-last-minute measure that largely reflected what environmental groups say they want. The proposal would restore environmental scrutiny for projects like hotels and resorts, developments on habitats for protected species and most advanced manufacturing plants. 
That proposal could not be voted on until next year.
Polluting facilities pose a ‘massive problem’
The June update exempts “advanced manufacturing” facilities such as hydrogen production facilities, plastic recycling facilities and lithium mining sites from environmental reviews as long as they are located in industrial zones and not on protected lands. 
In the months after, several advanced manufacturing projects have been proposed, including facilities on the San Bruno Mountain and in Solano County.
Environmental justice groups say restoring environmental reviews for projects like these is a priority, because those facilities are some of the most hazardous and polluting facilities and are often located near low-income communities of color. The environmental review process is typically the only chance residents get to voice concerns about developments near their homes, Sharma said.
Some lawmakers said that’s why they won’t vote this week for the budget bill to allocate money to implement the June reform. Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat on the budget committee, called the manufacturing exemptions “incredibly expansive” and a “massive problem.” 
“Most of us thought: ‘Why would we possibly want to vote for this bill … when the commitments in terms of cleanup legislation haven’t been met?” he told CalMatters.
Frustrations grow over last-minute dealmaking
Talks to tighten environmental regulations stalled amid the governor and legislative leaders’ fast-moving secret negotiations on major energy and climate deals this week, a common occurrence near the end of the legislative session.
The stifled effort contrasts how quickly California’s top Democrats scaled back the environmental rules in June. The governor at the time threatened to reject the state budget if the deal did not come through. The rollback was tucked into budget trailer bills — a tool leaders have increasingly used to rush major policies through with little public scrutiny.
“That is so ironic, because apparently it was totally fine to jam everyone on an exemption for advanced manufacturing … but God forbid you rush a cleanup bill,” Delfino said.
The rushed nature of the June deal, critics say, is why a “cleanup” is necessary.
“It was rammed down everyone’s throats,” Allen said. “It’s probably why we feel the need to push back on this particular issue because … this was a particularly aggressive and out-of-whack set of changes.”
“I continue to be extremely disappointed with anyone who takes advantage of this notion that delay gives leverage,” said Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat who said he didn’t cast a vote on the June rollback because of the manufacturing exemptions. “It prevents us from having a more open, transparent and democratic process to fully debate these important policy proposals.”
Even those who did vote for the rollback argue for more limits placed on manufacturing. Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, said he grew up next to a manufacturing plant and suffers from asthma to this day.
“It needs to be addressed immediately. …We are not in the 1970s and ‘80s anymore,” he said in a hearing Thursday.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/041323-CONSTRUCTION-MHN-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerThe U.S. Department of Education has abruptly terminated nearly $11 million for two grant programs that have been helping Wisconsin serve children with vision and hearing loss and others receiving special education services, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
Wisconsin is one of several states to be affected by the cuts to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part D grants. Others include Washington, Oregon and a consortium of New England states including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to ProPublica.
Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly called on the Trump administration to reconsider the decision in a statement this week. 
“Make no mistake, losing these funds will directly impact our ability to serve some of our most vulnerable kids,” Underly said. “Wisconsin had planned work with these funds that includes direct support for deafblind learners and their families and efforts to recruit and retain new special education teachers.”
According to DPI, the Trump administration said the programs “reflect the prior administration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those of the current administration.” 
The first program to be affected is the Wisconsin Deafblind Technical Assistance Project, which provides assistive technology tools, coaching, family support and professional training for young people up to the age of 21 with vision and hearing loss. The program currently serves 170 students, and of those, 85% have four or more disabilities. 
The funding cut comes in the middle of a five-year grant cycle. Wisconsin was supposed to get a total of about $550,000 that was expected to last through September 2028.
“These are kids who depend on specialized support just to access their guaranteed right to a free and appropriate public education,” Dr. Underly said. “Losing these dollars at this point in the year will be devastating for the kids who need these supports the most.”
The other program being cut is the State Personnel Development Grant, which focuses on helping address Wisconsin’s critical special education teacher shortage as well as assisting with recruitment, retention and development.
The grant funds from the program, which totaled $10.5 million, was helping to fund a number of programs, including the Special Educator Induction Program. In its first year, the state program helped 280 new special education teachers. 
“At a time when schools in every corner of the state are struggling to find and keep special educators, cutting this support is unconscionable and harmful to every student with an IEP,” Underly said.
According to DPI data, only 46% of new special education teachers in Wisconsin remain in the field after seven years. 
The state agency plans to appeal the Trump administration’s decision.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland GovernorNew Hampshire is the only New England state not participating in a regional effort of Northeastern states to create vaccine guidance separate from the federal government. However, Massachusetts Health Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said this week his team is “actively communicating” with New Hampshire’s public health agencies about the effort.
Neither the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services nor Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office responded to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.
In August, a group of public health officials from eight states — Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — met to discuss banding together and creating their own set of recommendations for vaccines separate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The effort comes amid concerns about the actions of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic appointed by President Donald Trump. In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. In June, he fired 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing many of them with vaccine skeptics. And, in August, he cut $500 million across 22 projects that sought to research mRNA vaccines for respiratory illnesses like influenza and COVID-19. Health officials throughout the country have decried the moves as dangerous and argued they’re not based in scientific fact.
Goldstein, speaking to a group of health journalists in Boston Monday, said the states’ August meeting was a continuation of discussions that had been ongoing all year.
“Back in January and February, states across the Northeast came together to start thinking about how we can operate and not replace CDC,” he said, “but backfill if parts of CDC start to fail and augment where CDC maybe wasn’t doing a good job in the first place.”
Goldstein described the group of state health officials as “a collaborative that has no name and a collaborative that is very cautious.”
“Nevertheless, we are a collaborative that has worked together on real, concrete issues,” he said.
Despite New Hampshire’s absence from the collaborative, Goldstein said communications continue with New Hampshire and other states.
“We’re having real conversations with red states, and they appreciate what we’re doing and lean on what we’re doing,” Goldstein said. “And also they can’t politically be the ones who are publicly coming out with the guidance.”
Goldstein said he expects the collaborative to expand. Indeed, since August’s meeting, Delaware has joined the group, Delaware Public Media reported this week.
“Folks in other parts of the country know what we’re doing,” he said. “They’re listening to us. They are interested in our recommendations, and I think we may end up as a much larger collaborative at the end.”
Earlier this morning, a group of Western states — California, Oregon, and Washington (Hawaii has since joined) — announced a similar but separate effort called the West Coast Health Alliance. That group of states have been more forthright in identifying their collaborative as a response to Kennedy and Trump’s. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington released a joint statement: “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.”
Many in the public health field have expressed mixed feelings about the effort. They’re afraid of the impacts of Kennedy’s policies and the turmoil he’s created in the federal government’s public health apparatus, but also fearful of how conflicting health recommendations and guidance will confuse Americans.
Dr. Debra Houry was the chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC until she, along with a group of other high level officials, resigned in protest over the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez. Asked by a Bulletin reporter about these two collaboratives, Houry said, “I get why people are doing it, but it’s going to cause some confusion and haves and have-nots.”
She also worries about “medical tourism by states” if providers decide to offer vaccines or other care only where it is recommended.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, called this “a balkanization of public health.” She compared it to gun policy.
“With firearms, they flow across state lines, which is why we see higher rates of firearms homicide and suicide in California after there are gun shows in Nevada,” Ranney said. “Similarly vaccinations, if you don’t have a group vaccinated in one state, it’s not like everyone in that state stays in that state.

Josh Stein on Friday. (Photo illustration of a COVID-19 vaccine by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Gov. Josh Stein signed an order Friday afternoon allowing eligible North Carolinians to receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine without obtaining a prescription.
This includes senior citizens as well as adults over 18 who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of high risk conditions, including asthma, COPD, diabetes, ADHD, heart disease and cancer.
“Right now, North Carolina is one of only a handful of states where people must get a prescription before they can get a shot at the pharmacy,” Stein said. “This is unnecessary red tape. It is time for North Carolina to get in line with other states across the country.”
Pharmacies may ask the patient certain questions or ask them to attest to the conditions that would make them eligible, but medical documentation is not necessary.
The Medicaid program is currently paying for COVID vaccines for individuals who are beneficiaries, said Larry Greenblatt, state health director and chief medical officer at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
“Vaccines are one of the most effective means available to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death,” NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said. “They help protect the health of children and adults, their families, and the entire community from the spread of infectious disease.”
Following state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina can administer those vaccines recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , but ACIP has yet to give its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season, NC Newsline previously reported.
ACIP is expected to release recommendations later in September, according to Stein’s office.
The governor’s office shared a list of retail pharmacies that have announced they have the updated COVID-19 vaccine available, to date: Brisson Drugs, Carlie C’s, Central Pharmacy of Durham, Costco, CVS Pharmacy, Food Lion, Hope Mills Pharmacy, Fairmont Drug Company, Ingles Markets, Med Smart Pharmacy, Med Source Pharmacy, Publix Pharmacies, Sam’s Club, Walgreens and Walmart.

SC grand juries join calls to allow cellphone signal jamming in state prisons

The three-person Federal Communications Commission will vote at the end of the month on whether to change a longstanding rule barring states from blocking cellphone signals in prisons.
Acting U.S Attorney Bryan Stirling pushed for the change for 12 years as head of the prisons agency — including making trips to Washington to testify — without getting anywhere due to pushback from the telecommunications industry. He’s pleased to finally see real movement, he said.
“I was frankly stunned, and happily so,” Stirling told reporters Friday.
Stirling and other law enforcement officials have long pointed to the dangers of allowing inmates access to contraband cellphones. Using the devices, prisoners have run drug rings, operated scams and ordered hits on people’s lives, officials have said.
Last month, the state grand juries joined the calls for action after signing off on numerous indictments of people already serving time for another crime.
“It’s a matter of public safety,” Stirling said. “It’s safety for the prisons, it’s safety for the public, it’s safety for the state of South Carolina.”
The change is far from final. If the commission votes Sept. 30 to move forward, people will have an opportunity to offer public comment on the possible change. The commission must then vote again before officially changing the rule.
If the change is approved, South Carolina will be ready, said Stirling and Joel Anderson, who took the agency’s helm in April.

Over the past two years, legislators have spent $18.5 million to install and maintain technology in state prisons that can identify cellphone signals, which agency officials can then report to the phone numbers’ carriers to get the phones shut off. But that’s a tedious process.
The same company providing that technology can add on a feature blocking all cellphone signals, Stirling and Anderson said. Stirling made sure that was written into the contract when the state bought the technology to prevent starting a $34 million project from scratch if the rule changed, he said.
“One of the things I wanted to make sure is we didn’t have to go back and rip all the equipment out and redo it,” Stirling said.
South Carolina was the first state in the country licensed to use the method of tracking and shutting down each individual cellphone, which officials have compared to a game of “Whac-A-Mole.” Last year, the technology resulted in 2,600 phones being shut off within the six prisons that used it, Anderson and Stirling said.
But reporting each phone is time-consuming, and it didn’t stop more phones from coming into the prisons, Anderson said.
Jamming can also block Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals necessary to fly drones over prisons’ 60-foot netting, which inmates use to deliver drugs and other contraband, Anderson said.
“What we have today, it’s really helped us a lot, but it can be better,” Anderson said. “That’s what we want. We want it better.”
The use of cellphones inside prisons has endangered prison officers as well as the general public, Stirling and Anderson said.

In 2010, inmates ordered a hit on anti-contraband officer Capt. Robert Johnson, who survived being shot six times at his Sumter home. In 2018, Army veteran Jared Johns died by suicide after becoming the target of an inmate-run extortion scheme. And in 2022, a man was charged with setting fire to the home of Lt. Francisco Collazo in what authorities believe was an inmate-ordered hit following a contraband bust.
Prisoners used cellphones to run a massive international drug enterprise that resulted in convictions for 40 people, both inside and outside of the state’s prison system. Unmonitored phones also make it possible for inmates to coordinate the smuggling of drugs into the prisons, which can hinder the rehabilitation process for prisoners struggling with addiction, Stirling said.
Cellphones put prisoners themselves in danger. If an inmate faces threats at one prison, officials used to be able to transfer them and keep them safe. Now, other inmates can communicate their feuds across the state, making sure threats follow a prisoner wherever they end up, Stirling said.
“This is something that I think is just vitally important for the public safety in South Carolina,” Stirling said.
The prohibition on jamming cellphone signals relies on a part of the federal Communications Act of 1934 barring anyone from interfering with any “authorized” radio signals. Prisoners’ illicit cellphones shouldn’t qualify because they’re not authorized to be in prisons, argues a commission report on the possible rule change released this week.
U.S. Attorney Bryan Stirling tells reporters he was stunned to see a federal move toward cellphone jamming in prisons Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
Federal prisons are allowed to jam cellphone signals, since the law bars only states from interfering with radio signals. That rule never made sense to Stirling, especially in places like Bennettsville, where federal and state prisons sit less than three miles apart, he said.
“If the federal government can do it, why can’t the states?” Stirling said.
Inmates would still be able to call their families using prison-supplied-and-monitored telephones and tablets, which will be able to get through the jamming, Stirling and Anderson said. The signal blockers also won’t affect officers’ radios used to communicate throughout prisons, the directors said.
“I’m telling you, jamming is the answer for these cellphones,” Anderson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3863-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Lawrence McClure talks to reporters following a Legislative Budget Commission meeting on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s budget outlook for the coming year is stable, but the prospect of potential deficits in the near future led the state House budget chief to suggest Friday that his chamber once again seek to lower state spending.
Lawmakers earlier this year clashed over the budget, leading to a lengthy stalemate that pushed the 2025 session into overtime. At the time, House Republicans claimed the state had been spending too much money and needed cuts to avoid future budget shortfalls.
In the end, the Legislature passed a smaller budget paired with substantial tax cuts designed in part to limit how much money the state receives from taxpayers.
A new long-range financial outlook for the state shows that Florida legislators should have a nearly $3.8 billion budget surplus for the 2026-27 fiscal year, which opens on July 1. But that surplus is projected to turn into a deficit the following fiscal year year and grow to a $6.57 billion hole in 2028-29 fiscal year.
The Legislative Budget Commission, which annually must approve a long-range financial outlook, heard a presentation on the projections before voting to approve it at its Friday meeting.
After the vote, House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, said it was his intention to have the “House dig even deeper this year for efficiencies, waste, and ineffective programs. I believe it to be our duty.”
“Everyone understands that we’ve got to keep chipping away at this,” McClure said.
McClure did not mention any specific areas for cuts, but noted that healthcare and education were the largest portions of the budget. Many “cost drivers” could be looked at, including the health insurance program for state workers that is once again projected to go into the red over the next few years, he said.
But McClure added that one way for legislators to tackle future deficits is to refrain from “spending as much of the new money.”
“We’re not at a place yet where we have to go in and cut services to the core,” he said.
Legislators sign off on a new outlook each September. The Legislature won’t begin work on a new budget until next year’s session starts in January.
The House and Senate squabbled over the budget this past spring as House Republicans insisted that spending had been growing too much the previous few years under Gov. Ron DeSantis and previous legislative leaders.
House Republicans pushed for billions in tax cuts as a way to reduce the amount of money in government coffers. After an extended session, the Legislature wound up passing a more than $115 billion budget that was smaller than the 2024 budget. But lawmakers did not cut taxes nearly as deeply as House Speaker Daniel Perez wanted.
Senate Majority Leader Jim Boyd, who also sits on the legislative budget commission, told McClure that the Senate “shares your concern and desire for fiscal responsibility.”

(Photo via Getty Images)Rhode Island has joined the growing list of states, including its two New England neighbors, in taking steps to ensure state residents can access the latest COVID-19 vaccine, despite more limited federal criteria. 
Gov. Dan McKee on Friday announced two separate state measures that counteract recent federal criteria adopted in August by the Food and Drug Administration, which restricted updated booster shots to people 65 and older, or with underlying health conditions. The FDA’s policy is far more limiting than in past years, prompting strong pushback by established medical organizations and some state officials.
“We are taking action in Rhode Island to ensure that the public health turmoil at the national level does not affect the ability of Rhode Islanders to access vaccines that keep us healthy and safe,” McKee said in a statement. “It’s crucial that people who want to get the COVID-19 vaccine have the ability to do so in Rhode Island.”
 A new Rhode Island Department of Health order explicitly authorizes pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 shots to all patients ages 3 and older. The four-page order, which remains in place until withdrawn or replaced by something else, suggests that pharmacists can give the shot as an “off-label” use to those who don’t meet the more restrictive federal criteria. That aligns with recommendations by major medical organizations, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for last year’s vaccine. The CDC has not yet issued guidance on the 2025-2026 vaccine, though its advisory panel on immunization is slated to meet at its Atlanta campus on Sept. 18 and 19.
“We will continue to make the COVID-19 vaccine available, and we will continue to be the source of science and fact-based information about vaccines in Rhode Island,” Dr. Jerry Larkin, state health director, said in a statement.
A separate notice issued Friday by the health department and Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner requires health insurance companies to keep covering COVID-19 shots. Insurers have already told state officials they intend to comply with this directive, according to McKee’s office. 
“Access to the COVID-19 vaccine promotes public health and mitigates outbreaks of disease that raise insurance costs and strain our hospitals and health care providers,” Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King said in a statement. “Vaccine coverage without patient cost-sharing eliminates financial barriers for consumers and preserves necessary access.”
Last week, Massachusetts became the first state in the country to defy federal restrictions by ensuring state insurers provide coverage for COVID-19 shots. On Wednesday, Connecticut followed suit with a pair of policies authorizing pharmacy distribution and mandating insurance coverage.
Other states have adopted similar policies this week, including Delaware, Virginia, New Mexico, Arizona, Maine and North Carolina.
State medical leaders backed McKee’s decision in separate statements, including Dr. Kara Stavros, president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, and Dr. Scott A. Rivkees, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Evidence of the COVID-19 virus rose in recent weeks, according to state monitoring of wastewater facilities. In the week of Sept. 6, the virus level was considered “high,” while emergency department visits and hospital admissions have started to tick up, according to online data. More than 90 people have died from COVID-19 this season, while 60 died due to the flu.
State vaccination rates for the 2025-2026 flu season have not been made publicly available.
The latest COVID shot is expected to be available at primary care provider offices in the coming weeks, according to McKee’s office. Adults can also get boosters at retail pharmacies or health centers, though children between six months and five years old should go to a pediatrician or family physician.
More information about where to get vaccinated, including arranging transportation, is available on the state health department website.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) The line at a local food bank’s weekly distribution in Albuquerque’s International District has increased in the last few years, organizers say, as neighbors in nearby homes join the queue alongside the growing population of unhoused residents.
Marissa Brown, who runs the Roadrunner Food Bank distribution, says the line has increased by approximately 50 households to 225 each week. She estimated a line once composed mostly of unhoused people pushing carts is now probably 60% people with roofs over their heads.
“We are just seeing more of our neighbors who are housed coming, too, because it’s just hard for everyone,” Brown told Source New Mexico as people worked their way through the line Friday morning. “We’re really pleased that we can just expand that reach to anyone who might need it, but it certainly has expanded.”
Even before cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contained in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” take effect, President Donald Trump’s second term has already hurt the food bank’s ability to feed hungry people in a state where more than one in five residents has food stamps, food bank officials told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
By the #s: More than half of NM groceries, convenience stores at ‘high risk’ due to SNAP cuts

For example, inflation has reduced how much food Roadrunner can buy with donations or grant funding, and the federal “Department of Government Efficiency” cuts to emergency food assistance programs earlier this year by 30 truckloads of food worth a little more than $1 million, according to Roadrunner officials. 
On Friday, that reduced budget meant food recipients had less variety to choose from, she said, as they walked through the line at the International District Library, though the food bank did happen upon a donation of flower bouquets, giving recipients a “surprise gift of joy.”
Still, Brown called it “frightening” to consider what will happen if the food bank has to rely solely on donations as people lose SNAP benefits, both at the distribution she runs and at food banks and other nonprofits across the state. 
“Even though the SNAP cuts haven’t quite happened yet, the [existing] benefits are not lasting as long,” she said. “So folks always do express how grateful they are that we’re here week after week, because they just wouldn’t be able to make it through the month.”
Food banks across New Mexico have previously warned that they don’t have the capacity to feed all New Mexicans if SNAP goes away. 
Jason Riggs, Roadrunner Food Bank’s director of advocacy and public policy, told Source New Mexico in a phone interview Friday that the Albuquerque food line, which is growing and feeding an increasingly diverse group of people across the income spectrum, is a harbinger of the near future after SNAP cuts go into effect. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

“Whenever there’s changes to SNAP, we see food lines grow,” he said. 
New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee analysts told lawmakers at an interim legislative meeting Wednesday that one-in-four New Mexico children live in households without consistent or adequate food. 
Of the roughly 460,000 New Mexicans who receive SNAP benefits, more than 36,000 could lose them entirely due to their immigration status or new work requirements, according to the LFC analysts. 
The Legislature will convene Oct. 1 in a special session primarily to discuss how the state will adapt to the federal cuts. 
Riggs said he hopes the Legislature focuses immediately on how it will mitigate the impacts of SNAP’s new work requirements, which go into effect Jan. 1. 
“Within months, there’s thousands of people that are suddenly going to be subject to work requirements,” he said, and the state has to figure out how to explain what’s happening and identify resources as soon as possible. 
“All that has to happen extremely quickly in order for thousands not to just flat out lose SNAP. So regardless of where we point the finger for people losing SNAP, our concern at the food bank is people suddenly losing their food resource and relying more on our food pantries.”

One of the people who could lose benefits is Kyle Neri, a military veteran who has lived on Albuquerque streets for the last few years with his dogs Mama and Bailey. He picked up a bag of mandarins and tins of beans and oatmeal Friday morning, along with a Ziploc bag of dog kibble. 
He said a car crash a few years ago damaged his spine, but he was denied disability assistance. He’s making do with $120 a month in food stamps, he said, along with a veteran’s disability payment of $700 for his Army service in the late 1990s. But inflation is already making it nearly impossible, he said, to feed himself while trying to save for permanent housing. He said he’s “of course” worried about losing food stamps amid rising food costs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:30:55+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Special education schools fail to provide required services,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/report-special-education-schools-fail-to-provide-required-services/,State auditors wrote that some private special education schools in CT are failing to give students all the services they need.,"Auditors raised concerns on Wednesday that some private special education schools in Connecticut are failing to give students all the services they need, hiring staff without background checks and relying on substitutes who lack certification. 
State auditors looked at records from five special education schools across the state — The High Road School of Wallingford, Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, the Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, University School JPE in Bridgeport and the American School for the Deaf. In each case, the auditors reviewed services rendered for one fifth of the students at the school. 
The report found that the High Road School of Wallingford, for example, provided to its students less than a third of the individual services for fine motor skills that were required in their students Individualized Education Plans, or IEPs — documents created by school districts that outline exactly what services a student should be receiving each year. The school also provided less than half of the individual and group counseling services that its students’ educational plans demanded. 
The Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, part of Hartford Hospital’s Institute of Living, provided about half of the group counseling services that its students’ plans demanded and 68% of individual counseling services required in those plans. 
In their responses to the audit, the schools argued that chronic absenteeism prevented them from being able to offer all the services that their students were required to receive.  
“We serve students who struggle with chronic truancy, as defined by the State,” the Grace S. Webb School responded in a statement to the audit, adding that they offer specialized programs that attempt to reduce student absenteeism that can be driven by psychiatric or emotional problems. “Given the population of the students who struggle to maintain consistent attendance at school, we often deliver services in non-traditional settings as students can tolerate, which may not have always been captured fully in documentation.” 
The High Road School of Wallingford gave a similar response. 
“Chronic absenteeism and other attendance challenges are common among our referred student population and can significantly limit our ability to deliver scheduled services,” they wrote, adding that they have added in a new monitoring system meant to help the school reach out quickly if a child is not attending or engaging. 
A spokesperson for the High Road Schools told CT Mirror that most of the school’s students come in mid-year with intensive needs and high levels of absenteeism. 
“One of our main priorities is creating a safe, welcoming and positive school culture that encourages attendance and drives students’ willingness to learn,” she wrote. She said they are in “close communication” with the local school districts and review the services that students receive each month. 
The Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, which serves 80 students, mainly with autism spectrum disorder, appears to have done better than the others, providing more than 85% of services for motor skills and language and communication skills. But the auditors noted that the academy did not provide any record of the counseling services that were being offered through the school. 
Alyssa Goduti, president and CEO of Adelbrook, said that they don’t bill counseling services separately, since they consider them part of services every child receives. She said their data has since been updated.
In response to the audit report, the State Department of Education said they were “concerned” about the allegations but said it was the responsibility of the local school districts to make sure special education students were getting the appropriate services. 
The High Road School of Wallingford is one of four High Roads schools across the state. Last March, the four schools were the subject of a report from the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT that revealed more than 1,200 reports of students being placed in restraints and seclusion within one year. Nearly half of those took place at the High Road School of Hartford Primary/Middle School. 
The report found that the students at High Roads were “grossly underserved both in terms of educational planning and service delivery.” 
“The investigation revealed widespread student disengagement and chronic absenteeism across High Road locations, failure to adequately assess and support students’ educational needs through individualized service delivery and, perhaps most alarmingly, gross deficiencies in the number of certified special education teachers and other credentialed educational staff working with children and systemic failure to ensure and/or document that staff had undergone employment checks and criminal and child welfare background checks,” the report stated. 
In September 2024, the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs claiming that the state Department of Education had failed to properly monitor what was happening in private special education schools. 
The Department of Education had said it  “vigorously disagree[d] with the conclusions” of the report and said they had not received any complaints about the school during the time period the report took place. The High Roads Schools said the report did “not accurately reflect the academic and behavioral supports at our schools” and that they had outlined their plans for improvements. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Connecticut Children’s Advocacy Center and the former Child Advocate, said she was concerned that the High Road’s report was a “canary in the coal mine” that indicated widespread problems of accountability within the industry. 
“You can’t have services and a system of care for highly vulnerable people that nobody oversees without bad things happening. And we do not learn that lesson despite being taught that over and over and over and over again,” Eagan said. 
Eagan said that while the local school district was responsible for making sure that a student was getting the special education services they were required to have by law, it was the state’s responsibility to oversee the districts. 
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the state Department of Education, said the agency was reviewing the audit to determine next steps. In July, the state announced the hiring of an outside firm to review the agency’s system around special education and how it responds to complaints. 
Another concern Eagan raised was that certain schools were not conducting required background checks or hiring qualified teachers. She said one of the issues they found in the High Road report was a lack of credentialed staff and long-term uses of temporary substitutes. The High Roads spokesperson told CT Mirror that the school does background checks on hiring and that they have a department dedicated to hiring documentation.
The audit found that one school in particular, University School JPE in Bridgeport, did not show any evidence of background checks being done for any of the nine teachers that the auditors reviewed. 
The school responded that they had purchased the school from another company shortly before the 2023-24 school year commenced and that they kept the employees from the previous school. They said they had been unable to get anyone to conduct fingerprinting on their employees but that they had all been submitted to background checks in April 2024. 
“At the time of the audit, USJPE had been in operation for less than one year and had not had the opportunity to conduct recurrent background checks. Background checks are completed upon hire and recurrent background checks will occur April 1st for anyone employed for one or more years,” the school said. 
The auditors also raised concerns around the American School for the Deaf and the Grace S. Webb School for a lack of policies and internal controls around background checks for their employees. According to the auditors, four of six American School for the Deaf staff who were hired before July 2019 did not have a records of a national criminal history records check, and one of seven staff at the Grace S. Webb school hired before that date lacked the same record.
The American School for the Deaf said its current policy requires background checks for new employees and for any promotions. The Grace S. Webb School said they plan to implement a process to ensure that periodic background checks are conducted.  
“The Grace Webb School has long been a place of healing and learning for students who need specialized psychiatric support,” said Tina Varona, spokesperson for the Grace Webb School. “The students who attend the school face unique challenges that make it difficult to integrate into mainstream classrooms and are often unable to attend a traditional school.”
Jeff Bravin, the executive director of the American School for the Deaf, told CT Mirror that the school was using a new tracking system to make sure students were getting all their services and that they had created stricter protocols, including a new tracking system, that would confirm that “every staff member has undergone the necessary checks and verifications before beginning their work with students.”
“The safety and well-being of our students are the highest priorities at the American School for the Deaf. We take the audit’s findings very seriously and want to assure our community that we have already taken appropriate steps to address all issues raised,” Bravin told CT Mirror.
The schools, with the exception of Adelbrook. were also found to have various degrees of non-compliance with the requirement for employment history verification, and all the schools except the High Road school had multiple staff members without prior work references in their files. 
The auditors warned that a lack of background checks put students’ safety at risk and noted that not having employment verification history would increase the risk that one of their staff members might have been fired from or left a previous job, or had their credentials suspended because of “an allegation or substantiation of abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct.”
Goduti said that although Adelbrook was compliant with all background checks, they were implementing ways to conduct recurring background checks to maximize safety. 
“Ultimately, kids need to feel safe. Families need to feel safe when they’re sending their students to us. So that is something that we prioritize,” she said. 
In a review of teaching certifications, four of the eight teaching staff that the auditors reviewed at Wallingford’s High Road School were long-term substitutes not certified to teach special education. Two of the four teachers the auditors reviewed at the University School JPE did not have evidence of a certificate in education, and the school principal did not have a state certification in either education or administration.  
The High Road School responded that they followed state requirements around hiring, and that people hired temporarily without certification were given mentorship and professional development. The school noted that they continued to try and recruit for positions, but said a nationwide teacher shortage required them to have “flexibility.” 
The University School JPE said the two teachers without a certification had bachelors degrees in their respective fields, and that the principal had a master’s degree from Fordham, had taught at Sacred Heart and Fairfield University and had worked for the prior owners of the school since 1984. 
Data from the State Department of Education shows that staffing vacancies at approved private special education programs have decreased by about 400 over the last two years, but that there are still 2,500 vacancies at programs across the state. 
Goduti said that while Adelbrook wasn’t facing staffing challenges, she was well aware of the shortage of special education teachers. She said her school does internship programs and they travel to high schools and universities to promote special education as a choice for young people. 
“We need to figure out how to get more incredibly talented young people to want to go into special education as a career. It’s a hugely rewarding career. So we’ve been thinking creatively about how we can incentivize and really encourage folks to work in this field,” she said. 
Goduti said Adelbrook appreciated the auditors’ work and that they were always trying to improve. But she said the report also didn’t show the dedication of their teachers or their students’ successes. 
“ We serve kids that really have had a lot of doors close on them in their lives. We try to meet them with compassion and commitment and rebuild the sense of trust and help them to think about what are their dreams and how do they get there,” she said. “All those beautiful parts of our service system, which we gladly showed the auditors when they came to visit, it just doesn’t come out in an auditor’s report that only identifies deficiencies but not successes or best practices that maybe could be shared or highlighted.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0312_SR_HighRoads_005-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — President Donald Trump granted a disaster declaration for Kansas Friday in the wake of destructive June storms and after bipartisan support from lawmakers concerned with recovery efforts.
Severe storms landed in southeast and south-central Kansas on June 3, causing tornadoes, straight-line winds and flooding that lasted until June 7 and damaged farms, homes and power lines. Roads in some areas were impassable.
Kansas was eligible  for more than $7.5 million in federal assistance, and it now can be shared among Barber, Butler, Chase, Coffey, Cowley, Franklin, Greenwood, Harper, Hodgeman, Kingman, Lyon, Morris, Osage, Stanton, Sumner and Wallace counties, according to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“These federal funds will go a long way in supporting the restoration work by those in counties impacted by the storms,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in a Friday news release.
The storms damaged bridges, utility infrastructure and roads in multiple Kansas counties, according to the Kansas Adjutant General’s Department, which is responsible for multiple state agencies, including the division of emergency management.
“The declaration allows state and local levels of government, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations that provide vital and essential services, such as rural electric cooperatives, to apply for public assistance funds for emergency and permanent work for the repair or replacement of infrastructure damaged by the disaster,” the department said in a news release.
On Tuesday, Kelly proclaimed another state of disaster emergency due to heavy rains and flooding in counties in central Kansas.
“Heavy rains and flooding impacted several counties yesterday and we will do what we can to support those counties,” Kelly said. “Do not drive into standing water, just 12 inches of rushing (water) can carry away most cars. Turn around, don’t drown.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/femasignmiranda_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderIt’s the final countdown for Democrat Debra Shigley and Republican Jason Dickerson in their mission to represent a suburban Atlanta state Senate district.
Early voting begins Saturday in parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties ahead of the Sept. 23 election, when residents will select a successor for former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican now serving as U.S. Treasurer.
Democrats are hoping to replace the MAGA stalwart with Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner.
Shigley was the top vote-getter in last month’s special election, but the Republican vote was split six ways. Flipping the seat that Beach regularly won by wide margins will not be an easy feat, but Democrats are expressing confidence that frustration with GOP control of the state and federal government will help push Shigley over the top.
They’re pulling out all the stops, including an assist from Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is scheduled to help with Shigley’s weekend get-out-the-vote effort.
Dickerson, a Cherokee County investment manager, has been hitting the trail as well and touting endorsements from top Georgia Republicans like U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick of Suwanee.
Republicans are betting that Dickerson will consolidate the votes earned by other Republicans in last month’s race and stop Democrats from flipping the seat.
Early voting will take place Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling places will be open on election day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced a Jonesboro business executive as her latest appointment to Arkansas’ State Board of Education on Friday.
David Peacock, president of Hytrol Conveyor Company, replaces former board chair Sarah Moore, whose term expired at the end of June. Peacock’s term runs until 2032.
In a press release announcing her second 2025 education board pick, Sanders praised the Marine Corps veteran as “an incredible asset” and leader, who is “passionate about workforce readiness, literacy programs, and education freedom.”
“With leaders like David helping implement the reforms we’ve brought about over the past two-and-a-half years, I know our school system will only continue to improve,” Sanders said in the release.
Peacock said in the same release that he was “honored and humbled” by the selection, and that he looked forward to working with Sanders and the other board members to help students “succeed and thrive.” Peacock donated $250 to Sanders in 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics.
“Education has opened countless doors in my own life, and it’s a privilege to now help create those same opportunities for children across Arkansas,” he said. “Partnering with parents and communities to prepare our students for the many paths ahead is both essential and inspiring.”
Peacock served in the Marines for over a decade, and worked for Rubbermaid, Textron, JLG Industries and Kalmar Industries before he joined the conveyor company in 2014. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from The Citadel and a master’s degree in management from Webster University, according to the release.
With Peacock’s appointment, Sanders has selected a majority of the current board membership. She appointed Ken Bragg and Leigh Keener in 2023, Gary Arnold in 2024, and Aaron Abbott last month. Sanders will have an opportunity to appoint another member before the 2026 general election, as the term of the board’s current chair, Adrienne Woods, expires next summer.
Sanders also thanked Moore, a former elementary school teacher who holds a doctorate in education policy, “for her years of support and for her help in implementing” the LEARNS Act of 2023.
Moore was appointed in 2018 by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and previously served as Hutchinson’s education policy advisor from 2015 to 2017.
“Because of her hard work and dedication, the future for Arkansas’ students is brighter than ever,” Sanders said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:06:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"As government funding deadline nears, CT Dems seek leverage",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/ct-government-funding-deadline/,How would CT Democrats exert what leverage they have in a Republican Congress — and what would they accept in a spending deal?,"Congressional Democrats, including Connecticut lawmakers directly involved in the appropriations process, are assessing the best way to influence government funding legislation with a quickly approaching deadline.
During the last government funding fight in March, enough Democrats ultimately backed a GOP spending bill that didn’t include their input, a move that kept the government open and averted a shutdown but riled up a base that wanted the party to put up a fight amid the cancellation of federal funding.
At the time, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, who had voted against the GOP spending measure, called on his party to “change our tactics.” But six months later, the Connecticut senator insisted Democrats will employ a different strategy over government funding.
“Ultimately what happened in the spring was … a handful of [Senate] Democrats voted for a bill that was written totally and completely by Republicans,” Murphy said in an interview. “That’s not going to happen this fall. Democrats in the Senate aren’t going to vote for a bill that isn’t negotiated between Republicans and Democrats.”
But the bigger question confronting Democrats is how exactly they go about exerting the rare leverage they have in a Congress completely controlled by Republicans — and what they’d be willing to accept in a spending deal to keep operations going. 
With the looming threat of a shutdown, lawmakers are facing a deadline of Sept. 30. And Connecticut’s appropriators — both Murphy and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, are playing active roles in the debate over funding for fiscal year 2026. Both are pushing for bipartisan negotiations but underscored that a lack of Democratic priorities and the continuation of the Trump administration withholding funds are nonstarters.
Congress is eyeing a short-term deal that will buy them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package. That stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, keeps government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time.
Government funding fights have become increasingly thorny issues for Congress. But this latest cycle is further complicated by outside demands from the White House and an ongoing push to withhold funds already approved by Congress.
Republicans advanced an initial rescissions package this summer that cut billions of dollars in public broadcasting funds and foreign assistance. Now, the Trump administration is seeking to take back an additional $5 billion through a process called “pocket rescissions” that would circumvent Congress. A federal judge recently ruled that such a move is illegal.
White House budget director Russ Vought has indicated he wants to keep Democrats out of the appropriations process and have it be “less bipartisan.” But realistically, any funding legislation needs support from Democrats in order to pass. Republicans only need a simple majority in the House, but in the Senate, they need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill.
Some Democratic appropriators like Murphy are wondering whether they can “trust” any funding agreements negotiated with the majority party because the administration could once again decide to circumvent Congress and its power of the purse.
“This president has either canceled or refused to spend over $400 billion, and that decision is both illegal and deeply harmful to our economy,” Murphy said. “We really risk writing a budget that’s not worth the paper it’s written on if the president decides he’s going to spend the money that he wants to spend and not spend the money in blue states or that are aligned with priorities that aren’t his.”
DeLauro, along with her fellow top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, released an updated tracker detailing how much the Trump administration has withheld in federal funding. The number has fluctuated as some funds have been released, but the most recent estimate is around $410 billion, including cuts in health, education and environmental grants.
How CT’s appropriators are navigating spending talks
While some White House officials are looking at more of a party-line strategy, appropriators are taking a more bipartisan approach.
DeLauro plays an even larger role as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. She’s been part of the committee for years, served as chairwoman when Democrats were in the majority in 2021 and has been the ranking member since Republicans took back the House.
She noted that the House and Senate have been on two different tracks and have spending bills with different topline numbers — the House is working with GOP-led legislation, while the Senate is pursuing bipartisan negotiations.
“We’ve made some progress here. I’ll continue to negotiate, but I will not support an agreement that doesn’t include Democratic priorities and doesn’t stop the stealing of funds through whatever procedural efforts the White House and [the Office of Management and Budget] wants,” DeLauro said in an interview.
“There’ll be tough negotiations, but I’ve been there before, and we ought to be able to come to a conclusion,” she added.
She indicated Thursday that talks between the Four Corners — the top Republicans and Democrats on the two appropriations committees — were heading in the right direction. DeLauro said they are “in sync” with a continuing resolution that would keep things for about a month or a little longer. Though that puts them at odds with the request from the White House for a months-long stopgap that runs through Jan. 31.
DeLauro was named to the conference committee that will include members from both parties as well as both chambers to negotiate and reconcile differences on three funding bills: Agriculture and Rural Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch. The plan would be to pass full-year funding for those three along with a stopgap bill to temporarily fund the rest of the government.
Meanwhile, Murphy is still working on a bipartisan bill as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. But he said Wednesday that they have yet to reach a compromise. His subcommittee pushed back the markup of the DHS bill that was scheduled for earlier this week.
Murphy attributed the holdup to the way the Department of Homeland Security is repurposing funding approved by Congress to go toward stricter immigration enforcement and Trump’s deportation and detention agenda. But he still hopes they can compromise.
What Democrats hope to get
Lawmakers have a few more weeks to sort out the details, but so far, Democrats are playing hardball, raising the prospects of a shutdown. But it’s also not immediately clear what their final conditions will be to win their support. 
“The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on health care, or they won’t get our votes, plain and simple,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference this week. Schumer took a lot of flak in March for helping to get the GOP spending bill across the finish line. At the time, he argued a partial shutdown would have been a worse option than voting with Republicans.
Health care has emerged as one of their main priorities in a spending agreement. And more Democrats appear to be rallying around an Affordable Care Act subsidy, known as the enhanced premium tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of the year.
If Congress doesn’t extend it in some capacity, insurance premiums are expected to increase, and the loss of financial help could lead to some Americans losing coverage altogether. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
“Our entire health care system will be undermined by the failure to renew these premium tax credits,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “Health insurance and these premium tax credits are absolutely essential to lowering the cost of health care.”
Blumenthal has co-sponsored federal legislation that would make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent.
Nationally, if the subsidies sunset at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that more than 4 million people would lose health care over the next decade, citing the increases in out-of-pocket costs because of more costly premiums. 
Amid the changes in the federal health policy landscape and the expiring tax credits, the Connecticut Insurance Department this week approved double-digit rate increases for state-regulated health plans in 2026.
Murphy said he’d like to see an agreement that goes beyond extending those subsidies and seeks to roll back some of the cuts to Medicaid that’ll be implemented in the coming years through President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“I see a health care disaster coming for Connecticut and the rest of the country later this year, and this budget has to abate that disaster,” Murphy said. “I’m not going to vote for a budget that isn’t real, and unless we put some provisions in this bill that make it harder for Trump to undermine the rule or law and ignore the spending in the bill, I don’t see how I can vote for it.”
Between some health care protections and commitments that the White House won’t redirect or cancel congressionally approved funds, Murphy thinks his vote is easy to get. “That’s a pretty minimalist set of demands, if you ask me.”
But those demands may not be met.
While the ACA subsidy extensions seemed to be on the table, Republican leadership recently indicated that it wouldn’t be a part of negotiations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he wants a “clean” bill.
But Democrats haven’t been the only ones pushing for the renewal of those subsidies, especially with the political reality that many Americans would lose coverage or face higher premiums at the start of the midterm election year in 2026. Some Republicans have also been supportive of extending the tax credits, and a group in the House recently backed legislation before spending talks ramped up.
Without getting into the specifics of what could be at the negotiating table, DeLauro said health care will be a “broad” piece of what Democrats are seeking. And both Murphy and DeLauro would like to see commitments that Trump won’t interfere with the new rounds of federal funding they are trying to pass.
“There’ll be a broad discussion about health care. Health care is a cost of living issue. I’m not specifying this one or that one,” DeLauro said. “We need a broad conversation about what should be included and that’s what the Democratic leadership is going to be doing.”
New strategy?
Democrats have been saying for months they want to fight harder — something that their supporters have been clamoring for since their defeat in the November elections.
Frustration surfaced among Democrats in the House and Senate over their funding strategy months ago.
Both Murphy and Blumenthal voted with many of their Senate colleagues against the funding bill. Nearly every House Democrat, including every member of Connecticut’s delegation, also voted against the bill in the spring.
Plus, the risk of a shutdown looms large amid negotiations and the uncertainty of finding consensus. And Democrats and Republicans are already giving a preview of the inevitable blame game that would play out if funding lapses after Sept. 30.
Republicans say the ball is in Democrats’ court to accept a deal to keep things open. Democrats, meanwhile, argue the GOP controls Congress and the White House and it’s on them to find consensus.
“The ultimate question of whether there’s going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to congressional Democrats, and that’s just the way it is,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.
There hasn’t been a government shutdown since the first Trump administration. It was a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019.
If there’s another one during Trump’s second term, Republicans would pay the price, Democrats say.
“I think we can come to a reasonable compromise here,” Murphy said, “And if the government shuts down, everybody in this country knows who runs the House, who runs the Senate and who runs the White House.”

However, […]","Secretary of State Diego Morales speaks at a Sept. 12, 2025 press conference at the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Indiana Secretary of State’s Office said Friday that a Vigo County man is being investigated for allegedly voting without being a U.S. citizen. According to Secretary of State Diego Morales, the man —who has a Mexican passport — registered with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in 2018 and voted in six separate elections.
However, no charges have been filed and the office couldn’t release a name. Morales praised a recent law that added additional citizenship verification for certain voters, which he said allows election officials to scrutinize voter rolls.
“This case in Vigo County is proof that hard work is paying off; it is proof that noncitizens have voted in Indiana; and it is proof that our legislation is necessary and effective,” Morales said.
Under House Enrolled Act 1264, voters with registrations tied to temporary identification credentials from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles must meet additional proof of citizenship requirements, which includes an appeals process. 
Following the law, which was enacted in July, the BMV sent names with temporary credentials to the state’s election division. In a comparison with the state’s registered voters, the election division identified 1,611 names in 91 counties that needed to provide additional information.
Those counties then had the responsibility to follow-up. Once notified by the county, registered voters had 30 days to verify their citizenship. Morales’ team said they hadn’t heard from counties about the other 1,610 names submitted for additional verification and couldn’t confirm if any others had been checked. “A few” names had their citizenship verified directly by the office.

Upon receiving his notice from Vigo County, the man apparently responded by providing his Mexican passport and verbally confirmed that he wasn’t a citizen, according to the office’s legislative policy director, Kegan Prentice.
Prentice said providing the Mexican passport was “obvious” proof of the man’s non-American citizenship, though it is possible to have dual citizenship.
“… usually, at minimum, if they’re going to respond to this notice they’re not going to respond with proof of citizenship from another country,” Prentice said.
Vigo County referred the case to local law enforcement, who turned it over to the Indiana State Police. 
Morales said his office has additionally notified the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI. 
“Some critics said that these measures were not necessary; that noncitizens were not voting in Indiana,” said Morales. “… we are even facing a potential lawsuit over these requirements. But we now have concrete evidence that this is happening in Indiana.”
 Additional context

With the 2024 law, voting rights advocates worried that a naturalized citizen might miss the county’s letter about providing additional proof of citizenship and lose their voter registration. In April, several voting rights groups sent a “notice of violation” alleging that the new law runs afoul of the National Voter Registration Act.
Prentice rebuffed that criticism.
“Just because the registration is canceled, does not mean that individual can’t vote. There are plenty of failsafe mechanisms in Indiana. Individuals can always cast provisional ballots,” Prentice said.
Morales, a naturalized citizen who was born in Guatemala, said he would be “more than happy” to share his naturalization documents if he’d been flagged for additional scrutiny.

“I don’t think that this is a barrier. I think that we’re talking about transparency and I would have no problem — and I know many other naturalized citizens who would not have that problem — to show their proof of citizenship,” Morales said.
Groups of individuals who may have driver’s licenses, but aren’t citizens, include immigrants granted temporary protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy or Ukrainian refugees. 
Morales pointed to a similar effort to check citizenship in Iowa that identified 2,186 individuals. Of those, 277 were found to be noncitizens and 35 voted in 2024 elections. Of those, six have been charged as of June.
“That is why I’m thinking that this is the first case,” Morales said.
Morales also said the state had complied with an expansive DOJ data collection effort, providing names, addresses, driver’s licenses and partial Social Security numbers of registered Hoosier voters to federal authorities.
“If providing the Justice Department information can help Indiana with ensuring our voter list is accurate and up-to-date, we will do so. We will take all the help we can get,” Morales said. “I am proud to work with President (Donald) Trump and his administration to strengthen election integrity.”
Jerry Bonnet, the office’s chief legal counsel, said the Attorney General’s Office advised them that they were “required to provide that information.”
Other states found otherwise and have declined to share their voter lists. On Friday, Stateline reported that the DOJ is sharing that information with the Department of Homeland Security to identify noncitizens.
Morales vowed to continue his work to tamp down on noncitizen voting, which is rare.
“My biggest accomplishment so far as secretary of state is requesting proof of citizenship, and I’m always going to be working with President Trump and his administration and our general assembly here to make sure that only U.S. citizens are able to vote in Indiana,” he said.
In 2024, Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters and just under 3 million, or 62%, voted in that year’s general election. The Hoosier state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For nearly three years, prospective business owners have eagerly waited for the date they could join Rhode Island’s budding retail cannabis market. That day is now here.
At the start of the Cannabis Control Commission’s monthly meeting Friday afternoon, chairperson Kimbelry Ahern announced regulators are now accepting online applications for two dozen new retail licenses through late December.
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Cannabis regulators open screening portal for social equity retail license applicants

The commission opened the initial screening process for social equity applicants on Aug. 29. Social equity applicants are defined as those who were adversely affected by the War on Drugs, including residents in census tracts of five Rhode Island municipalities identified as “disproportionately impacted” areas from past cannabis prohibition.
As of Friday, Rhode Island Cannabis Administrator Michelle Reddish said 89 prospective social equity applicants have already applied for screening. Certification is expected to be complete some time in November.
All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Regulators will accept submissions through 4 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 29. Ahern said Commission and Cannabis Office staff will provide technical assistance resources guidance for prospective applicants.
“Today is a significant day for the commission and Rhode Island,” Ahern said. “This milestone represents the culmination of years of work and collaboration.”
It’s certainly been a slow road for the state to establish its recreational cannabis market. Over a year passed before the three-member commission was impaneled, which then needed to hire staff to draft proposals and conduct a review of rules adopted in other states.
That left sales to the state’s seven pre-existing medical dispensaries, which have been allowed to sell recreational cannabis under hybrid licenses.
Those seven stores sold a combined $118 million worth of cannabis products last year, according to state data. Through the end of August 2025, existing hybrid retailers have made nearly $80 million in sales.
Regulations were finally approved by the commission in April, taking effect in May.
The inaugural rules require applicants to first be screened to ensure they meet qualifications before being placed in a lottery held in each of six designated geographic zones.
All prospective retailers are required to pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. But the application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants — whose qualifications for the speciality license  through the end of September.

Free.,Trump administration sued for using Ghana as ‘end-run’ around deportation protections,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-sued-using-ghana-end-run-around-deportation-protections,,"WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit. “Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.  Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin. The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture. They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S. Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.Third-country removalsA deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee. Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there. The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country. They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit. The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents. One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit. Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents. Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records. “The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

The free three-day event, held from Sept. 16-18 at the Environmental Learning Center in south Jackson, was organized by HOPE Enterprise Corporation and Yancey Consulting. It will include presentations and support from other major financial institutions like Capital One, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.
The idea for the festival, HOPE CEO Bill Bynum said, was developed following the 2024 election as a way to empower people in communities across the Deep South.
“Last November, it was clear that we were at a very critical point in the country and that there were going to be changes in the economic policies going forward,” Bynum told Mississippi Today. “But we’d also seen over the years that we know what it takes to ensure that people in places like in the Delta, in the Alabama Black Belt, in south Jackson, in Central City in New Orleans could navigate these economic shifts, these political shifts, these crises.
“So we reached out to our investors, to our board, to our team here at HOPE and our allies and said, ‘It’s time to create a new paradigm where everyday people in the South have the tools they need to prosper,” Bynum continued. “Delta Fest is not just a forum, it’s not just a conference. We see it as a strategy, a vision.”
An opening ceremony will take place on Sept. 16 and will be hosted by comedian Rita Brent and feature musical performances by Benjamin Cone with members of the Mississippi Mass Choir and the Jackson State Sonic Boom Pep Band. Later, there will be a fireside chat with music executive and Jackson State University professor Cortez Bryant. 
The next two days are dedicated to sessions broken into three tracks: Ownership, Entrepreneurship and Community Infrastructure. One will feature Jackson Mayor John Horhn along with the mayors of Birmingham, Montgomery and Little Rock. They will be joined by other local and national leaders, policymakers, creatives and entrepreneurs to share ideas, resources and information.
Bynum said he expects that by the end of the festival, there will be “some clear direction, some clear tools that people can put to use to start to advance a prosperous economy.”
“This isn’t just ideas and platitudes, this is really around, ‘What can people pick up right now to do and build within their entrepreneurship, ownership and community infrastructure?’” said Lisa Yancey, the founder and president of Yancey Consulting. “Anything that we want to materialize, anything that we want to manifest isn’t outside of us. It is already within us … We just need to activate it.”

DPH officials believe exposures may have occurred between Sept. 2 and 11 at Georgia State University, Sweetgreen Restaurant in Atlanta and at youth soccer practices and games.
This case represents the seventh case of measles in Georgia this year, while other states have been dealing with larger outbreaks.
Last year, Georgia had six cases of measles. Before that, except for 2019 when there were 18 cases, Georgia has had little to no confirmed cases of measles for the last 15 years.
Measles symptoms appear within one to two weeks of exposure and can include high fever, runny nose and watery eyes before a rash of tiny red spots breaks out, usually starting at the head and spreading to the rest of the body.
The virus can lead to severe complications, especially for groups including young children and pregnant women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five unvaccinated people who gets measles in the U.S. is hospitalized. About one child out of every thousand who gets measles will develop encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can lead to intellectual disabilities.
Between one and three out of every thousand children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurologic complications, the CDC finds.
Measles is preventable with the MMR vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, a routine vaccination recommended for all children. But health experts worry that growing vaccine skepticism could contribute to the spread of preventable diseases like measles.
In Georgia, 88.4% of incoming kindergarteners had gotten their MMR shots during the 2023-2024 school year, according to CDC data – that’s down from 94% 10 years prior and 99.6% in the 2009-2019 school year.

They gave advice to state Sen. Jason Bean, who was at the dais presiding over the Missouri Senate  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A newly-gerrymandered congressional map and limits on voters’ ability to amend the state constitution cleared the Missouri Senate Friday, capping two weeks of contentious debate that drew national attention.
The changes to the initiative petition process will appear on the statewide ballot next year. 
The new map, designed to give Republicans control of seven of Missouri’s eight seats in Congress, now heads to Gov. Mike Kehoe for his signature. It may ultimately end up on next year’s ballot as well, with a group called People NOT Politicians Missouri announcing Friday that it will file a referendum with the secretary of state’s office to “put this deeply flawed map before Missouri voters.”
The legislature reconvened last week at the urging of President Donald Trump, who has demanded Republican-led states rework congressional districts so the party holds on to its slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm election. 
The White House started pressuring Missouri Republicans to get in on the act in July, and this week phoned in to the state Senate GOP caucus meeting. The initiative petition changes were added to the agenda by Kehoe, with Republicans arguing the current system makes it too easy to change the Missouri Constitution. 
The Missouri House passed both measures Tuesday. The Senate gave them final approval Friday morning 21-11 after moving to shut down a Democratic filibuster following four hours of debate. Republican Sens. Lincoln Hough of Springfield and Mike Moon of Ash Grove joined nine Democrats in opposition to the new maps and the initiative petition changes.
Democrats say both proposals as a power grab by the Republican supermajority and a Trump-inspired assault on democracy. And they’ve denounced changes to the Senate’s rules this week designed to undermine any possible opposition. 
“This is a cynical maneuver designed to put a thumb on the scale of democracy, to ensure predetermined outcome regardless of the will of the people,” said state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat. “It is a betrayal of our duty to represent the people, and not a political party.”
 Congressional map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. 
The 5th District, which has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats argue it is unconstitutional to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge the new map.
Republicans say critics are misreading the constitution and are confident the new map will survive any legal challenge. 
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, said Friday that the map undermines decades of work to reunite a community divided at Troost Avenue, the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal. 
The GOP-backed map, Nurrenbern noted, splits Kansas City down Troost once again.
“Somebody in D.C. sought to resurrect the Mason Dixon Line of Kansas City,” she said. “Somebody in D.C. decided to split the 4th and the 5th congressional districts down Troost.”
Moon, one of only a handful of Republicans who have publicly opposed the new map, expressed concern Friday about legislators not being allowed to have any input in the process. 
“I ask myself what President Trump would do if he were in this body,” Moon said, “and someone told him, ‘this is all you’re going to get, and you vote yes, sit down and shut up.’”
For those seeking to repeal the map through the referendum process, they must collect 100,000 signatures in 90 days to put the map on the November 2026 ballot. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
“This fight is not over,” Elsa Rainey, a spokeswoman for People NOT Politicians Missouri, said in an emailed statement. “Missouri voters — not politicians — will have the final say.”
If they collect enough signatures, the legislature would have to move the referendum election to another date. That’s because local election officials say congressional districts must be finalized by May 26 for ballots to be ready in time for the August primary. 
The last time the referendum process was successfully deployed was in 2018, when labor unions successfully repealed a right-to-work law. The Missouri AFL-CIO has signaled it is likely to assist in a referendum over the maps.
 Initiative Petition

Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot.
In recent years, Missourians have used the initiative petition process to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana use, as well expand Medicaid eligibility.
Republicans have fumed at the success of progressive ballot initiatives for years, arguing they are bankrolled by out-of-state special interests.
When the bill cleared the Missouri House, Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis said amending the state constitution has become too easy. Any changes, he said, should have “broad consensus across the state.”
The legislation approved Friday would require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by Missouri voters to attain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts in order to pass.
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The new requirements would only apply to citizen-led initiative petitions, not amendments placed on the ballot by the legislature.
“If you’re a politician in Jefferson City, you become more powerful after this passes,” sais state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat.
The question will go on the 2026 ballot and require a simple majority to approve.
Sam Licklider, a lobbyist for the Missouri Association of Realtors, told lawmakers this week that his organization will oppose the proposal on the ballot.
In 2010, the realtors raised $4.4 million to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit sales taxes on real estate transfers. That was followed in 2016 by a $5.6 million campaign to prevent lawmakers from extending the sales tax to services.
“We are well positioned,” Licklider said, “to ensure our arguments reach the public.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_bean1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Two federal agencies had to move 35 people from the Minnehaha County Jail in the run-up to a state-funded saturation patrol late last month in Sioux Falls.
Minnehaha County officials asked federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service to transport the inmates, whom the county is paid to house, to other regional facilities to make space for a surge in local inmates.
“These troopers are very good at what they do,” said Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, who had advance notice about the operation. “If 15 or 20 troopers show up, they’re going to make arrests.”
State corrects record: 78 people arrested during ‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ saturation patrol

The saturation patrol ran on three days leading into Labor Day weekend as part of “Operation Prairie Thunder.” The branded campaign is a two-part initiative from Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, meant to address crime in Sioux Falls — where some crimes have hit five-year lows — and help federal immigration agents detain people suspected of being in the U.S. without authorization.
The Rhoden administration has said the operations won’t impact the Highway Patrol’s budget, but the movement of inmates points to other costs associated with the campaign.
ICE agents moving inmates aren’t on the street enforcing immigration law, said Milstead. The county jail, meanwhile, lost the revenue it had earned by housing federal inmates, and the federal agencies incurred the expense of transporting them to other facilities.
The first of what are meant to be monthly saturation patrols over the next six months put 15 additional Sioux Falls-area state troopers on the city’s streets. 
On top of tickets for drunken driving and speeding, the troopers arrested 78 people on drug charges. Twenty-seven of them were booked at the Minnehaha County Jail and released on their own recognizance, but 51 stayed through the weekend to await a bond hearing with a judge.
Milstead said he supports the enforcement efforts, but that supporting it meant making room at the jail to brace for the impact.
“As another operation approaches, we’ll need to do the same thing,” he said.
Courts, public defenders also impacted
The court system also felt an impact. Two judges hear bond arguments and set release conditions for inmates in two separate courtrooms the afternoon after a typical weekend. The courthouse was closed the Friday before Labor Day and on the holiday, however. 
Between the extra days and the extra arrests, the courthouse needed to pull another judge into service in a third courtroom to manage the overflow.
It’s not the first time that’s happened, though, according to Second Judicial Circuit Court Administrator Karl Thoennes. The Tuesday after the holiday was “busy, heavy, but not unusual necessarily” after a four-day weekend in the state’s largest metro area.
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith said her office saw a “significant uptick” as a result of the operation. 
“Our concern is that these are typically non-violent, nuisance-type offenses and outstanding warrants,” Smith wrote. “Dedicating substantial attention to these cases diverts limited resources away from our ability to prioritize the most serious cases — those involving victims awaiting resolution and matters that directly impact public safety.”
Federal inmate movement
The movement of federal inmates was meant to insure there would be space for local inmates, who take priority over inmates from other jurisdictions. 
Sheriff Milstead said his jail asked ICE to move 16 of its detainees to other facilities, and for the U.S. Marshals to transfer 19. The federal agents had to drive some as far as Sisseton.
“They’re moving some of them 150, 200 miles away,” Milstead said.
‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ will assist with deportations and boost Sioux Falls law enforcement

Some of the transferred inmates will likely need to return to Sioux Falls, at least temporarily. That’s because the federal government has prisons, but it doesn’t have jails. 
People incarcerated as they await trial on federal charges typically stay in local jails, and the federal government pays a fee — $114 per day, per inmate in Minnehaha County — to house them. Jails also collect fees for housing ICE detainees before they’re transferred for appearances in regional immigration courtrooms.
The jail in Sioux Falls didn’t stop taking federal inmates after the transfer. Eight people were arrested on immigration violations during the saturation patrol and were booked at the jail, filling half the beds ICE detainees had left before the operation began.
ICE did not immediately respond to questions from South Dakota Searchlight about the situation.
Barry Lane, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Marshals Service, said it’s not uncommon for federal inmates to be moved out of local jails to make space when things get busy. Transporting inmates, he said, is “one of the most expensive things we do.” 
Lane, who works in the Washington, D.C., area, said he wasn’t aware of any particular difficulties for marshals in South Dakota. 
“Whatever’s going on near you, it may or may not be unusual,” Lane said.
Locals would like to see permanent commitment
Milstead expects the “roller coaster” of jail movement to continue with Operation Prairie Thunder, but he’d like to see a more permanent response from the governor’s office.
He and Sioux Falls Police Chief Jon Thum have had conversations to that effect with Rhoden’s office since the first saturation patrol. Their hope is to embed a state trooper permanently in one of the area’s joint task forces. There are three: one for violent offenses, another for the service of felony warrants and another that targets drug trafficking.
Those task forces, he said, help explain why the city’s been able to hold the crime rate largely steady as the population has grown, and to see some offenses drop to five-year lows.

Thum said he appreciates the state helping out by patrolling the streets for the same reason he sees the task forces as important. His patrol officers frequently attend to calls for service and are less able to target traffic enforcement, like troopers do, or dive into long-term investigations, as the task forces do. 
“The day-to-day operations of the city tie up a lot of our resources,” Thum said. 
But Thum said the idea of welcoming a task force trooper, with specialized training in drug interdiction, may be more hopeful than pragmatic in the near term. 
Hiring officers has grown difficult statewide, the chief said. Thum’s department is authorized to have 302 officers. He has 294. The Highway Patrol, he said, “is dealing with the same thing we’re dealing with.”
“We’re perpetually playing catch up at this point,” Thum said. “Once agencies get to be a certain size, you’re just constantly in hiring mode.”
Steve Long, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said the Highway Patrol has a 12% vacancy rate at the moment, but there are trooper recruits heading soon to the state’s law enforcement academy. 
Long didn’t say how many troopers the state’s authorized to hire, but legislative documents offered in January put the figure at 201. At that time, there were 21 vacancies.
Josie Harms, spokeswoman for Rhoden’s office, said the administration is amenable to the idea of adding a trooper to a Sioux Falls task force. 
Harms confirmed that the governor’s office has been in discussions with Sioux Falls officials about it, and wrote that “it is certainly a possibility, though nothing has been finalized.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Office of Inspector General filed a formal ethics complaint Friday against former Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green — accusing her of ghost employment and misuse of state property. 
The investigation began months before her abrupt resignation last Friday.
The filing, which was signed by Inspector General Jared Prentice, accuses Green of violating multiple provisions of the state’s ethics code. 
It builds on a remediation agreement first reported this week by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, which prohibited Green from using state resources for political purposes and cautioned her against inappropriate conduct toward employees in her office.
The next step is a public meeting before the state ethics commission, where the inspector general will present evidence and Green will have an opportunity to respond. It’s up to the commissioners to decide whether the allegations constitute violations of Indiana’s ethics code and what sanctions should follow.
Green also could enter into a settlement agreement.
She did not immediately respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment Friday afternoon.
The inspector general also has a duty to refer any evidence of potential criminal activity to prosecutors, who would decide independently whether to pursue charges.
Ghost employment is a felony under Indiana law.
Allegations in the complaint
The complaint alleges she improperly involved state employees in her political campaign, used state property for personal and political purposes, required staff to perform personal errands on state time and retaliated against an employee who cooperated with investigators.
According to the complaint, Green directed two state employees to generate campaign content for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook page and instructed another staffer to proofread posts.
Investigators said those actions not only violated the state’s ban on political activity during official duties, but also amounted to ghost employment because the work was performed on state time.
Story continues below.
REDACTED Complaint - 2025-03-0077_Redacted
 
The inspector general further alleged that Green held a meeting with a political director from the National Republican Congressional Committee during working hours and used a state conference room for that meeting. 
The complaint states that Green also required two employees to retrieve her assigned state vehicle from Crown Point, Indiana — a personal task performed on state time that the OIG said also violated the ghost employment rule.
Separately, investigators pointed to Green’s use of her official title on her private “Battle-Proven Leadership” website, where she sells training seminars and a book.
By attaching her state position to those business ventures, the complaint argues, Green violated the state’s prohibition against misuse of state property. The inspector general also alleged she used her state vehicle, and instructed an employee to do the same, for personal errands.
The complaint further accuses Green of retaliation against an employee who cooperated with the OIG’s investigation. 
According to the filing, Green threatened one of her employees “with either demotion or termination” after learning the employee had provided information to the OIG. The complaint further asserts that Green “made derogatory comments” and called the employee “demeaning names” after the employee sat for an interview and responded to subsequent requests for information. 
State law prohibits retaliation against employees who participate in inspector general investigations.
Five different employees are named within the complaint. The Capital Chronicle has redacted the names from the document.
What comes next
The filing comes only days after the Indiana Capital Chronicle published a previously confidential remediation agreement Green signed with state officials in July. 
That document laid out restrictions for her continued employment, including an explicit ban on using state vehicles for political purposes, a directive not to ask employees to staff political events and a warning not to comment on employees’ appearances. 
The remediation agreement was intended to correct problems and allow Green to remain in office, while the inspector general continued its investigation.
Remediation document reveals ethics concerns before Indiana cabinet secretary resignation

Green ultimately resigned on Sept. 5 after serving less than nine months as Indiana’s first secretary of public safety.
The complaint was released one day after the Indiana State Ethics Commission held a closed-door meeting in Indianapolis. 
Commissioners met for less than 20 minutes in an executive session to consider a probable cause affidavit and “an individual’s alleged misconduct.” Green’s case was not listed on the public agenda, however, and commissioners declined to comment afterward. 
By law, complaints remain confidential until probable cause is established.
The process requires the commission to determine whether ethics violations occurred and, if so, what sanctions are appropriate. Penalties can include fines and even barring a person from future state employment, per state statute. 
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration. 
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Closing the North Carolina AFL-CIO convention on Friday, state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs thanked union organizers for their support and pledged to fight for their rights.
“I want you to know that I will not back down from any fight to protect your rights and freedoms,” Riggs said. “I am committed to a North Carolina where workers are protected, freedoms are exercised, and families can thrive.”
On the conference’s first day Wednesday, Gov. Josh Stein made a similar promise to help create a North Carolina that supports working families. The second day of the gathering largely focused on the federal crackdown on government employees under the Trump administration and how labor leaders can take a stand.
The annual convention also saw a changing of the guard in the NC AFL-CIO, with MaryBe McMillan stepping down as union president after eight years in the role. Riggs swore in her successor, Braxton Winston II, a former Charlotte City Council member who was the 2024 Democratic nominee in the state labor commissioner race.
McMillan commended Riggs for remaining steadfast and fighting for the voting rights of North Carolinians amid the monthslong election challenge by her opponent, Judge Jefferson Griffin.
“She never gave up,” McMillan said. “She fought fiercely for voting rights and for justice, for all of us, for our democracy, and to make sure that all of us had a voice in that democracy.”

Riggs said she was grateful for McMillan’s 20 years of organizing in the state’s largest labor federation, adding that there remains much work to do to achieve fair conditions for workers.
“We are in a state where wages are too low and workers do not have adequate protections. We’re in a state where unions don’t have the ability to fully organize or advocate for our workers,” Riggs said. “But in this moment here, looking at what’s happened in the last year, I want to celebrate the progress that you have made for our state and our people. North Carolina is better because of the people in this room.”
She commended the growing number of unions in the state as well as skills trainings, paid internships, and organizing campaigns created by labor leaders in North Carolina, where unions have historically faced structural challenges. A right-to-work state, North Carolina is estimated to have the lowest union participation rate in the U.S., at 2.4%.
But the state’s unions have been important political forces, Riggs said. The NC AFL-CIO endorsed and mobilized to elect both Stein and Riggs, the most prominent elected leaders at this year’s convention. Riggs said she was inspired by the persistence embodied by labor activists in North Carolina as she fought to uphold her own win in the state courts.
“I want to thank you for your support, and I want to let you know that your example inspired an entire nation, because folks really needed to see what a fight looks like,” Riggs said. “And if they’d been following labor, they would have known labor’s been fighting all along. But in the moments after the November election, people needed to see a fighting spirit and they saw it here in North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9123981-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Several hundred Boeing workers cheered Friday afternoon at the St. Louis Music Park in Maryland Heights after learning union members voted overwhelmingly to reject a new contract offered by the company. 
“It was jubilant for a minute,” said Boeing assembly mechanic Christy Williams, “and now we’re heading back to the strike line.”
About 3,200 Boeing workers who assemble advanced aircraft and weapons systems at the company’s facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. have been on strike since Aug. 4.
Union members of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 voted Friday to reject Boeing’s modified five-year contract offer, choosing to remain on strike.
“Our members in St. Louis have once again shown that they will not settle for Boeing’s half-measures,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant in a prepared statement issued Friday. “Boeing must start listening to its employees and come back to the table with a meaningful offer that respects the sacrifices and skill of these workers.”
According to the union statement, Boeing’s modified offer didn’t include a sufficient signing bonus relative to what other Boeing workers have received or a raise in 401(k) benefits.  
Williams said the new offer wasn’t much different than the previous rejected offers and called it “insulting.”
“We need to be compensated,” Williams said. “They don’t think we’re intelligent enough to understand contractual agreements, but we’re good enough to build the best fighter jet in the world. It’s crazy to me.”
She said it didn’t address one of the most important issues of compensating longtime workers. It mostly benefits newer workers, she said, like Williams and her son who joined the company a few years ago.
“This contract works for me and my son,” she said, “but it doesn’t work for the people at the top of the scale. And if the people at top of scale don’t continue to go up a little bit, especially based on economics and economy and cost of living, then it’s eventually going to cut all of us off who are at lower scale.”
In a statement after the vote, Boeing said it was “disappointed” employees rejected what its touts as offering 45% average wage growth. 
“We’ve made clear the overall economic framework of our offer will not change, but we have consistently adjusted the offer based on employee and union feedback to better address their concerns,” the company said. “In the meantime, no further talks are scheduled. We will continue to execute our contingency plan, including hiring permanent replacement workers, as we maintain support for our customers.”
Williams said members aren’t too worried about the company’s threat to hire permanent replacements because there’s no one there to train them.
According to the union statement, the workers assemble and maintain things like the F-15 fighter jet, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies, adding that their work “plays a vital role in safeguarding national security and supporting U.S. and allied defense operations.”
“The message could not be clearer—our members expect Boeing to do better,” said IAM Midwest Territory General Vice President Sam Cicinelli. “They will not be brushed aside with small adjustments. Boeing needs to stop dragging its feet and negotiate an agreement that honors the contributions of its workforce.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2964-2-1024x812.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Democratic lawmakers kicked off their statewide tour Thursday in Huntington, fielding questions from local residents concerned about paying their bills, their local schools and health insurance. 
A state employee raised a question about the financially-troubled Public Employees Insurance Agency, which wasn’t addressed during the most recent legislative session. “My fundamental question is, is my wife going to lose her health insurance?” he asked.
It was the first stop on West Virginia House Democrats “Kitchen Table Tour” that will take them around the increasingly red state this fall to talk with constituents ahead of the 2026 legislative session. The GOP supermajority in the Legislature ignored pressing issues, Democrats say, like the need for clean drinking water, child care options and skyrocketing utility costs. 
“We would like to focus on issues that West Virginians need us to focus on. There are a lot of things that are not getting done,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, who also serves as chair of the state Democratic Party. 
About 50 people attended the tour’s first stop at Huntington’s Kitchen. 
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, and Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, attended the event, along with Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, who is joining House Democrats for part of the tour. Other Democratic lawmakers will join at future stops.  
“West Virginia, unlike any other place probably in the union, we’re probably all more alike when it comes to these kitchen table issues,” Lewis said. “Everybody worried about their high-ass utility bill. Everybody worried about whether I can get a good job, whether your grandchildren aren’t going to be able to afford college … we’re fighting for you, and you have the opportunity to fight for yourself.”
The party is also hoping to recruit volunteers and candidates ahead of next year’s election. There are 11 Democratic members in the state Legislature, which is overwhelmingly GOP and holds a supermajority in both chambers. After years as a blue state, Republican voter registration is growing in the Trump-friendly state, and Democratic registrations now account for just 28% of West Virginia registered voters.
In the 2024 election, 50 House of Delegate and Senate races — almost all with Republican candidates — were uncontested. 
“We have done a lot with a little. We just need more,” Hornbuckle said. “We have been able to effectively slow down some things, and every once in a while stop that legislation, but we do desperately need more numbers.”

Education a big concern in Huntington 
WOWK news anchor Amanda Barren moderated the event, and it kicked off with a retired teacher immediately asking about the impact of the state’s school voucher program, The Hope Scholarship, on public education. The nearly $100 million program, established in 2021, gives families roughly $5,200 per student in taxpayer money to use for private schools, homeschooling and more. 
“Some people are just not going to turn that down, and they don’t understand the consequences of that,” Hornbuckle said. 
Cabell County Schools, which contains Huntington, has said students using the Hope Scholarship contributed to a $7.1 million funding decrease this year. Population decline was also a factor. 
Hornbuckle said he plans to introduce legislation next year that would require families using the Hope Scholarship to pay their public school if their child is going to participate in athletics or arts programs. 
“Since you pulled that money out, you’re not paying for the services right now,” he said. 
Pushkin emphasized there are limited guardrails on the program, and millions of dollars from the of Hope Scholarships were used at out-of-state schools and to purchase iPads, dance studio fees and more. 
House Democrats proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration this legislative session. 
With more families choosing homeschooling, a woman in the audience said she worried about children who were being homeschooled without oversight. “We don’t know if these kids are being put in a bad situation,” she said. 
Garcia responded that the Legislature still needs to work on adding guardrails to the state’s limited homeschool regulations, noting the 2018 death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning who was being homeschooled after teachers reported potential child abuse. Three adults are in prison for her death.
In 2024, a Boone County girl died from apparent starvation while being homeschooled.
No laws have been changed to tighten homeschool laws in cases of suspected child abuse despite attempts from House Democrats.
“It’s the simplest way to have a narrow exception, and we haven’t been able to pass that. That is crazy,” Garcia said. “That is one of the things that we’re fighting right now — to have more accountability for those kids, especially those who are in that vulnerable state.”
Other attendees raised questions about affordable housing, and one woman emotionally shared the challenge making ends meet while paying a mortgage. She worried about others who can’t find a safe and affordable place to live with children despite working.
“I know how close I am to poverty that I am, and I’m a nurse … I don’t know how [families] make it,” she said. “If you’re down, you cannot get up.”
There were also concerns about the state’s limited public transportation and massive shortage of child care spots. 
Democratic lawmakers took notes on people’s concerns, saying they’d like to learn more and explore potential future measures — especially bipartisan legislation — to address problems.
“Stay in communication, call us, email us … so that way we can strategize when we need to strategize,” Lewis said. “Ultimately, don’t be discouraged. Don’t be downtrodden. The power is with us.”
The dates for the rest of the tour are:

Morgantown on Sept. 30
Charleston on Oct. 7
Fairmont on Oct. 14
Wheeling on Oct. 16

Matt Meyer has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening support for the state’s volunteer firefighters and emergency responders, addressing declining ranks and rising emergency calls that threaten emergency response capacity.  This is critical to Delaware because we are unique. Delaware is the only U.S. state that relies on volunteer firefighters even in its capital city, Dover. Only Wilmington has a fully paid fire department. Without enough volunteers, response times could lengthen and communities could face serious safety risks.
Key Bills


House Bill 171 updates the Delaware Volunteerism Act, allowing high school students to earn one elective credit and fulfill community service requirements by volunteering with local fire departments. Schools must notify students of the option during course selection.


Senate Bill 28 provides a $7,000 funeral expense benefit for deceased members of volunteer fire companies, ladies’ auxiliaries, and volunteer ambulance or rescue companies. The benefit takes effect Oct. 1, 2025, and applies even if other state burial benefits are available.


Senate Bill 86 expands the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund, now permitting donations from individuals, charitable groups, and counties.


House Bill 124 increases the maximum fees the State Fire Marshal’s Office can charge to reflect rising service costs.


“Volunteer firefighters save lives every day,” Meyer said in a statement. “These bills are an investment in public safety, in teaching the next generation, and in the dedicated Delawareans who answer the call when we need them most.”
A Mounting Crisis
“Delaware’s volunteer fire stations are facing a serious recruitment and retention crisis and it’s has been building for more than a decade”, said Gordon Edwards III, Fire Chief of the Brandywine Hundred Fire Company No. 1 in North Wilmington, and a third-generation firefighter.    The challenge for Firefighters is changing:


Shrinking Volunteer Numbers: Enrollment at the Delaware State Fire School dropped from 408 in 2009 to just 189 in 2019, a decline of more than 50 percent.


Rising Emergency Calls: Over the past 30 years, emergency calls have tripled statewide, putting more pressure on fewer volunteers.


Changing Lifestyles: Younger generations juggle school, work, and social demands, leaving less time for unpaid service. Many newcomers assume fire services are fully paid, and traditional family legacies of firefighting are fading.


Economic Pressures: The rising cost of living makes it harder for people to commit time to volunteer roles that offer no financial compensation.


“Volunteering at your local fire station is more than fighting fires… it is the first step to helping protect the people in your community,” remarked Gordan. “We are looking for a wide variety of volunteers, not just firefighters. We have tasks for almost anyone, including helping to coordinate emergency responses, organizing community events and fundraisers, teaching fire safety at schools and community centers, and maintenance roles that will keep the equipment and vehicles ready for use.”















Editor’s Fact Box: How to Help Delaware’s Volunteer Firefighters
Volunteer Opportunities• Fire & Rescue Roles: Most Delaware fire companies train new volunteers for firefighting, EMS, or rescue operations.• Support Roles: Many stations also need administrative help, fundraising assistance, and event volunteers.
Where to Start• Visit the Delaware State Fire School website (statefireschool.delaware.gov) for training details and application links.• Contact your local fire company—most have online sign-up forms and monthly orientation nights.
Other Ways to Give• Make a tax-deductible donation to your local fire company or the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund.• Share their recruitment posts on social media to help spread the word.
Why It MattersDelaware relies on volunteer firefighters across nearly every community. Your time, skills, or financial support can help keep response times low and neighborhoods safe.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/R.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Charles Ray Crawford, 59, is set to be executed Oct. 15 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, after multiple requests by the attorney general’s office. 
Eight justices joined the majority opinion to set the execution, concluding that Crawford has exhausted all state and federal legal remedies. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice T. Kenneth Griffis Jr. wrote the Friday opinion. Justice David Sullivan did not participate. 
Last fall, Crawford’s attorneys asked the court not to set an execution date because he hadn’t exhausted appeal efforts in federal court to challenge a rape conviction that is not tied to his death sentence. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up Crawford’s case. 
A similar delay occurred a decade ago, when the AG’s office asked the court to reset Crawford’s execution date, but that was denied because efforts to appeal his unrelated rape conviction were still pending. 
After each unsuccessful filing, the attorney general’s office asked the Mississippi Supreme Court to set Crawford’s execution date. 
On Friday, the court also denied Crawford’s third petition for post-conviction relief and a request for oral argument. It accepted the state’s motion to dismiss the petition. Seven justices concurred and Justice Leslie King concurred in result only. Again, Justice Sullivan did not participate. 
Crawford was convicted and sentenced to death in Lafayette County for the 1993 rape and murder of North Mississippi Community College student Kristy Ray.  
Days before he was set to go to trial on separate aggravated assault and rape charges, he kidnapped Ray from her parents’ Tippah County home, leaving ransom notes. Crawford took Ray to an abandoned barn where he stabbed her, and his DNA was found on her, indicating he sexually assaulted her, according to court records. 
Crawford told police he had blackouts and only remembered parts of the crime, but not killing Ray. Later he admitted “he must of killed her” and led police to Ray’s body, according to court records. 
At his 1994 trial he presented an insanity defense, including that he suffered from psychogenic amnesia – periods of time lapse without memory. Medical experts who provided rebuttal testimony said Crawford didn’t have psychogenic amnesia and didn’t show evidence of bipolar illness. 
The last person executed in Mississippi was Richard Jordan in June, previously the state’s oldest and longest serving person on death row.

The stories and memories of the place endure.,"This was a Friday night in 1978. Malcolm White, who planned to settle in New Orleans, was visiting Jackson. His Booneville buddy, the late Michael Rubenstein, then a popular Jackson TV sportscaster, suggested they dine at The Mayflower Cafe. And dine they did.
“The place was packed and there was a line waiting outside, and it seemed everyone knew everyone, and of course everyone knew Rube,” White remembers. “The fish was fantastic, the vibe even better. Everybody seemed to be smiling and laughing between bites. I looked a couple tables over and there sat Miss Eudora (Welty), herself, and of course she was having as much fun as everyone else. It just felt like home. It was definitely my kind of place. I had a similar experience at the old Cerami’s at the Reservoir the night before. But that night at The Mayflower I thought to myself, ‘Hmmmm, Jackson, this is a place I could live.’”
Forty-seven years later, White, who became Jackson’s arts and entertainment engine, has never left.

Rick Cleveland
I moved to Jackson a year later, taking a job at The Clarion Ledger with no plans to make Jackson a permanent home. I had similar experiences at The Mayflower. Back then, The Mayflower stayed open until hungry people quit coming in, often well after midnight. We would put the finishing touches to the sports section around midnight and head to the ’Flower for redfish, oysters or soft-shell crab and something cold to drink. Lots of times, we already had eaten the blue plate lunch there, too. Mr. Mike (Kountouris), the longtime owner and an unforgettable character, took care of us. Friday nights were like homecoming. I am not telling you The Mayflower kept me in Jackson all these years, but I am telling you it has been an integral part of my life. It has been for so many. And Friday nights remain like homecoming.
What brings this all to mind this week was The New York Times listing of America’s Top 50 restaurants of 2025. The Mayflower Cafe made the list, along with such nationally renowned restaurants as Emeril’s in New Orleans, Sunny’s Steak House in Miami, and several of the newest, hippest restaurants in food meccas such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
What sets The Mayflower apart on this week’s list: It opened its doors at the corner of Roach and Capitol 90 years ago. The next oldest restaurant of the Times’ Top 50 is Emeril’s, which opened in 1990. Clearly, The Mayflower endures. Indeed, Malcolm’s father and my dad were Mayflower regulars as far back as the early 1950s. Mississippi governors, political leaders, movers and shakers were regulars even before that. 
But it wasn’t so long ago we regulars feared The Mayflower’s days were numbered. Jerry Kountouris, Mr. Mike’s son who took over for him, was ready to retire and nobody in the Kountouris family wanted to continue the restaurant business. Jerry, who had somehow guided The Mayflower through the pandemic that closed so many restaurants across America, put the business up for sale. For the longest time there were no takers. On more than one occasion, Jerry confided he was ready to close the place.
Enter former Jackson Mayor Kane Ditto and business partner Mart Lamar, who bought the building and convinced Hunter Evans and Cody McCain, owners of the popular and award-winning Elvie’s in Belhaven (which made the same New York Times list in 2022), to run the restaurant. The “new” Mayflower, which kept so much of what made the old Mayflower so special, opened for business in August of 2024. It took all of a year for it to be named one of America’s top 50 restaurants.

Said Ditto, “I just thought it would be devastating for downtown Jackson, especially the west side, if The Mayflower closed. It would have been. I am just so happy we were able to keep it going, and I am happy for this recognition from The New York Times. It is richly deserved.”
It had to be a difficult balancing act for Evans, a James Beard Best Chef finalist, and McCain to decide what to keep of the old place and what to change. Perhaps the best move was to retain many of the people: wait staff, cooks, bussers and security. The menu has  remained much the same, from the delectable onion rings to Redfish Jane. So have the sauces. The prices are higher, yes, but surely you have been to the grocery store lately.
Says Evans, “The hardest part was I felt like I had to explain to the old guard that we were not trying to come in here and make it about us and change everything. Our main goal was to preserve the history and story of The Mayflower. We thought the best way to do that was to renovate the dining room with some necessary changes. We didn’t just show up with new ideas and say, ‘Forget the old Mayflower.’ I called old regulars, I asked them about the menu and what they ate, I went to the Department of History and Archives. We care a lot about The Mayflower, everyone who has made this a part of their lives and the significance of this restaurant to our community.” 
Was there added pressure because of the place’s rich history?

“There was a little pressure, for sure, but we also understood what it would take to usher The Mayflower into the next 100 years as well as thrive in our community,” Evans answered. “That is why this recognition is so rewarding. We were able to help share this story that started so long ago. We are a small part in the life of this restaurant but we were able to share the story of this institution to the world.”
There are welcome menu additions such as the feta-brined fried chicken and Trout Amelia. There’s now an oyster bar and a happy hour. Oh, and yes, you need not leave the restaurant to use the restrooms, which are shiny and new and clean. Maybe it was part of the charm of the old Mayflower that, when nature called, you went outside, around the side of the building and up a narrow, dreary stairway to perhaps the most spartan toilets imaginable. I will always remember what my wife said one time, returning from the ladies’ room: “If I ever decide to commit suicide, I know just the place.”
So many memories and stories: 

Of so many Mayflower nights with the late author and pal Willie Morris, who charmed everyone in the place and who almost always was the last customer to leave before they locked the doors behind him. When paying his tab, Willie once also wrote a check for $10,000 to my then 6-year-old son, and in the memo line he scribbled: “FOR BOOKS!” Willie usually ordered spaghetti, took it away in a to-go box and shared it with his cat, Spit McGee, sometime before dawn. To this day he remains the only person I ever knew to order spaghetti at The Mayflower.
Of sitting in a booth with my family when the then-Governor and his wife stopped by to chat. The governor went on and on, as politicians do, as we put our dinner on pause. Finally, he left. Said my 3-year-old daughter: “Just who does he think he is?” Out of the mouth of babes…
Of many lengthy lunches with the late Gov. William Winter who loved The Mayflower almost as much as he loved Mississippi. Every lunch was a history lesson. That’s where he told me about the Southeastern Conference’s first office being just down Roach Street on the 13th floor of the Standard Life Building. As a result of that lunch, a historic marker now marks the spot one block from the front door of The Mayflower.
And this from Sandra Stevens Burns on Facebook: “My late husband, Warren Burns, was missing, in an Alzheimer’s haze. He was found standing in front of his beloved Mayflower, having walked there from Woodland Hills. When asked how he found it, he grinned and said, ‘I could smell the rolls.’”

For years, I had a long-running bet with Mr. Mike, who always grumbled about the sad state of the old King Edward Hotel, a crumbling home for pigeons and vagrants, just down Capitol Street from The Mayflower. Mr. Mike bet me he would die before the King Edward was either torn down or refurbished. As I often told him, it was a bet he couldn’t win because if he won I couldn’t pay him. He won. Mr. Mike died in 2005. The King Edward reopened as a Hilton Garden Inn in 2009. Mr. Mike was right. He usually was.
His beloved Mayflower Cafe will celebrate its 100th birthday in 2035. I am placing no bets but surely hope to be there. And I hope the soft-shells are in season.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/12120246/Mayflower-DOYLE-39.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo: Lisa Sorg)The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission voted 10-5 Thursday to adopt a new definition of “wetlands.”
This change would mean the state “wetlands” definition aligns with the federal definition, which shifted in 2023 due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.
This decision meant the EPA’s authority to regulate wetlands became limited to those with a “continuous surface connection” to permanent navigable waters.
North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has been applying the revised “wetlands” definition since a 2023 law took effect in June of that year.
The law modified the text’s definition to say, “wetlands classified as waters of the State are restricted to waters of the United States.” The modification follows the federal decision to recognize wetlands only as those that are connected to navigable waters.
Sue Homewood from the Division of Water Resources led the presentation on the “wetlands” definition.
“While we did a regulatory impact analysis, the baseline was the session law that is already in place. The Division has been implementing this session law since it was passed,” Homewood said.
As a result, the conclusion from the regulatory impact analysis was there is no change in adopting this rule from the session law.
Opponents to the rule amendment voiced concerns over the loss of wetland protection in North Carolina, Homewood told the commission. There were also worries about how the rule would impact flood resiliency and wildlife habitats.
Julie Youngman, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said many other states were deciding to adopt stronger wetland protections to fill the gap that was being left by the Sackett decision.
“It’s concerning that the General Assembly in North Carolina chose to do the opposite,” she said. “Rather than fill the gap left by Sackett, it created a bigger gap by declaring wetlands that were previously protected under North Carolina law.”
Environmentalists would like to see legislators consider legislation related to reimplementing preservation and conservation for isolated wetlands.
Wetlands can act like a sponge in times of heavy rain, absorbing stormwater that would otherwise rush downstream to flood communities.
Fewer protections for wetlands could impact the water filtration service that they naturally provide, meaning more pollutants could enter wildlife habitats and drinking sources. NC Newsline has previously reported that in North Carolina 2.5 million acres of isolated wetlands are vulnerable.
“We should focus on what’s important for North Carolina: that we’re spending a lot of investments in mitigation and flood resiliency, that these wetlands could help provide for that,” Homewood said.
One commissioner asked if there was an analysis on the impact of the resources that would no longer be covered following the change.
Homewood said the division has not conducted an analysis on the federal definition.
“It’s a moving target,” Homewood said.
EMC’s adoption next heads to the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings.

Catherine Cortez Masto speaking with a Forest Service employee after the Davis Fire in Washoe County in 2024. (Cortez Masto Senate office photo)When Linda Wadleigh was a forestry major at Utah State University she came upon her first summer job as a firefighter, a role that led to a 30-year career in wildland fire management with the U.S. Forest Service.
After years in the field, she and a handful of other women firefighters decided to create a boot camp to recruit and prepare other women to become firefighters through hands-on training and classroom learning opportunities.
“I didn’t see many other women, and I just wanted them to have the same chance that I did, to see what a great career this is,” Wadleigh said.
The Women in Wildfire Boot Camp program was established in 2011 and continued for more than a decade before it was terminated in February because of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
As part of Trump’s sweeping plan to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government, his administration has issued dozens of orders cutting support from government initiatives to promote more diversity.
At a July 10 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Forest Service Acting Chief Tom Schultz was asked to explain why the boot camp program was eliminated. He responded, “there are still ample opportunities for all firefighters to be trained without singling out solely women.”
About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Forest Service boot camp was launched to bring new firefighters, especially women, into a field that has historically struggled with worker retention.
The boot camp provides a structured path to becoming a wildland firefighter, but graduates still need to apply and once hired all new recruits receive the same fire training and must meet the same physical standards. 
After the program’s success in Arizona and New Mexico it expanded into 14 national forests across several western states. It was also adopted by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. At the program’s height, it trained and recruited over 200 people a year.
“We’ve recruited hundreds of applicants, that’s a great number to work with. We don’t want to lose that when we have trouble filling all our jobs,” said Wadleigh, who hired firefighters in her position as a district ranger at the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona before retiring last year.
Those recruits went on to fight wildfires in surrounding states, including Nevada, as U.S. wildfires have grown more severe in recent years.
Linda Chappell, another firefighter who helped run boot camp’s, said she knew the program had legs by the third year when it started regularly receiving more applicants than available slots.
“Women don’t know they can have this job, or women are hesitant to jump in for an entire fire season. After getting them in for a week of training they knew if they loved it or didn’t,” Chappell said, who retired in 2021 as an intermountain regional fuels program manager.
Both women are working with several members of Congress to urge the Trump administration to reinstate the program, saying its elimination will exacerbate the shortage of federal firefighters.
The Forest Service has lost more than 1,400 fire-certified federal workers since February as part of the Trump administration’s work to reduce the size of government. The agency has also recently asked firefighters to work more hours amid the staffing cuts.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and six other senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior Friday requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp program and its immediate reinstatement. 
“Thousands of firings at land management agencies across the country have already left land managers understaffed for upcoming fire seasons. We are concerned the elimination of this program will exacerbate this issue,”  reads the letter.
The National Intraagency Fire Center reports the U.S. has experienced more than 48,000 wildfires that have burned through more than four million acres across dozens of states this year.
“Eliminating a successful outreach program such as the [Women in Wildfire Boot Camp] unnecessarily limits recruitment to a smaller pool of potential trainees when there is already a shortage of skilled and willing potential workers,” the letter continues.
Chappell, the firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she believes the program was caught up in a sweeping DEI ban without reason.
“We think it may be just an unintended consequence. We’re not convinced that’s what they intended when the executive order was signed. So let’s go ask, is that really what was intended?” Chappell said. 
However, announcements about the boot camp that are still online warn “any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded.”
The letter requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp was also signed by U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR.), and Angus King (I-Maine).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GkqhUxZW0AAdq69-1-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

The man who claims his “time has been lost forever and cannot be recaptured.”
These are a few experiences cited by plaintiffs in a March 28 class action lawsuit against the architect and vendor of the state of Rhode Island’s online public benefits and health insurance marketplace portal, RIBridges. The system was hacked by cybercriminals in July 2024, exposing the personal information of an estimated 644,401 Rhode Islanders. The data breach went undetected and unpublicized until mid-December. The cybercriminal group Brain Cipher took credit for the breach and leaked the data online shortly before the new year.
Now the plaintiffs are one step closer to possible relief under a tentative agreement with defendant Deloitte.
Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island show the parties entered into mediation in June. Following an Aug. 19 mediation session, lawyers for both sides told the court on Aug. 25 that they’d reached an agreement “in principle” and would file a preliminary-approval motion within 45 days. Details, however, are slim as to what that settlement might look like. 
Peter Wasylyk, who serves as the plaintiffs’ local liaison on the multistate legal team representing the aggrieved, said in a phone call Thursday afternoon that “it’s only internally settled.”
“So at this point, unfortunately, there’s no information to give other than what was filed with the court,” Wasylyk said. “Once the final settlement is drafted, we’re going to file it with the court. I’m sure we’ll have a lot more to say once we get the final settlement.”
On Sept. 5, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose extended a stay on approval so that both parties can work out the final settlement on paper. The parties have until around Oct. 9 to file their draft agreement for court approval.
The tentative settlement intends to resolve the case Pannozzi v. Deloitte Consulting LLP, which merged a set of six interrelated lawsuits filed in response to the RIBridges data breach into one case.
RIBridges firewall worked. But forensic report says hundreds of alarms went unnoticed.

A small number of people who did not apply for benefits were also affected, as the federal government allows states one connection to national databases used to determine benefit eligibility, a pathway RIBridges fulfills in the Ocean State.
People affected by the breach — whose stolen data may have included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and health and banking information — were notified earlier this year and provided free credit monitoring. 
If the court approves the settlement, it’s likely a public claims site would go live so eligible people could apply for any possible compensation. Following that, a final court “fairness hearing” typically approves the settlement terms and payouts. 
Deloitte has already reimbursed the state $5 million for credit monitoring and other costs associated with the incident. Neither Deloitte nor the Rhode Island Department of Administration — which runs the RIBridges system through its technology office — responded to requests for comment.
A separate civil investigation by the office of Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is still ongoing, spokesperson Tim Rondeau said in an email Thursday.
Meanwhile, the state has in the final steps of securing a vendor, The Northland Highland Holding Company LLC, to “modernize” the RIBridges system, according to a procurement determination form posted online in July. The RIBridges architecture dates back to the late 2010s and, last year, the state started seeking a new vendor to build upon, but not replace, Deloitte’s existing system. The nearly $3.8 million contract would run from Jan. 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027, with four annual renewals possible after the existing contract period.

Deloitte points finger at Brain Cipher
The March 28 filing from the plaintiffs and their attorneys allege that Deloitte’s “lax data security policies” helped to create the conditions for the breach, and that “Plaintiffs and Class Members were injured and lost money or property, which would not have occurred but for the unfair and deceptive acts, practices, and omissions” it alleges by Deloitte.
“Deloitte was at all times fully aware of its obligation to protect the personal and financial data of consumers, including Plaintiffs and members of the Class,” the 71-page suit reads. “Deloitte was also aware of the significant repercussions if it failed to do so.”
In a 52-page memo filed on May 27 in support of Deloitte’s motion to dismiss the case, the defense argued that the multibillion-dollar consultancy actually had no duties to the plaintiffs or any consumers, but to the state alone.
The memo signed by one of Deloitte’s attorneys, Jeffrey S. Brenner of Providence firm Nixon Peabody LLP, argues that the suit does not “allege any facts establishing a direct relationship between Deloitte and Plaintiffs — either through contract, commerce, or otherwise.”   
“Indeed, Plaintiffs do not even allege that they were aware at any point prior to the RIBridges Incident that Deloitte had a role in the Rhode Island State-managed RIBridges system, much less that they had any direct relationship with Deloitte at any point whatsoever,” the memo reads. 
Brenner concluded that Brain Cipher was the true source of the plaintiffs’ woes, and that the cyber gang’s actions were “specifically designed to subvert and evade Deloitte’s operation of the RIBridges system.”
“Thus, even if Plaintiffs were able to establish that Deloitte breached a duty of care, Brain Cipher’s criminal cyber-attack severs the causal chain and renders any alleged negligence on the part of Deloitte too ‘remote’ to give rise to liability,” the attorneys wrote. 
Because Brain Cipher was the ultimate source of injury, the attorneys argued, Deloitte could not be held accountable for the impact alleged by the plaintiffs. The defense was not too impressed by the extent of that impact either, writing that the complaint offered “no specific facts tying their alleged injuries to the RIBridges Incident.” 
In the case of one plaintiff who testified in court documents that he had lost irretrievable time dealing with the breach’s after-effects, the defense wrote that the plaintiff “fails to include any specific allegations of how his lost time would have been spent — and expressly alleges that it may have been used for ‘recreation.’”
“Moreover,” the memo adds, “the theory that they were damaged as a result of the RIBridges Incident is facially inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ own admission that thousands of data breaches occur every year that could just as likely be the cause of the alleged injuries.”

Free.,Appeals ruling threatens routine care access for Medicaid enrollees at Planned Parenthood,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-ruling-threatens-routine-care-access-medicaid-enrollees-planned-parenthood,,"WASHINGTON — Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the country began telling Medicaid patients Friday that their routine health care appointments will no longer be covered as a federal court order takes effect. The change, which could remain in place for months, if not longer, will likely impact the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood clinics for health care not related to abortion. “This decision is devastating to patients here in the state and across this country. And it is compounding what is an already broken and overstretched health care system,” said Shireen Ghorbani, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. “We know that cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated.”Dominique Lee, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, said there is no plan for other health care providers to absorb the Medicaid enrollees. “There's no one waiting in the wings to take care of our patients,” Lee said. “Planned Parenthood is the safety net.”Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.“We are working, you know, feverishly with our colleagues and teams to mitigate that number,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. “We have to remember 50% of Planned Parenthood patients use Medicaid for their health care insurance. And so that is a very meaningful impact to the health centers that also rely on reimbursement in the same way every other single health care provider relies on reimbursement for the services provided.” GOP law targets Planned ParenthoodFederal law for decades has barred funding from going toward abortion services with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress included a provision in their “big, beautiful” law that prevents Medicaid funding from going to certain health care organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in reimbursements from the program during a recent fiscal year. The language, which originally applied for 10 years but was reduced to one year in the final version of the bill, appeared to specifically target Planned Parenthood. It prevents the organization from receiving any Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing.Planned Parenthood quickly filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in Massachusetts in July, shortly after President Donald Trump signed the legislation.  A district court judge issued a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction that month, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing that one aspect of the law and allowing Medicaid patients to continue going to Planned Parenthood for routine health care services.On Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s ruling, clearing the way for the Trump administration to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for Medicaid patients while the case continues. Peyton Humphreville, senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America and one of the lawyers handling the lawsuit, said on a call with reporters Friday the organization is evaluating all of its options but doesn’t expect additional rulings until later this year at the earliest. “The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals has entered a briefing schedule on the preliminary injunction appeal that will be fully briefed by mid-November,” Humphreville said. “From there, the court will schedule oral argument and will at some point after the oral argument rule on the preliminary injunction appeal.”",,,,2025-09-12 13:56:56.277236

“The next phase will include a comprehensive mission with the Tennessee National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Memphis Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies, and we are working closely with the Trump Administration to determine the most effective role for each of these agencies to best serve Memphians,” Lee said in a statement released Friday afternoon.
Lee added he plans to speak with President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon to “work out details of the mission.”
Trump told Fox News that he plans to send federal troops into Memphis, after weeks of speculation and calls from state Republican officials for him to do so.

Trump said the Shelby County city was a “deeply troubled” and that the city’s Democratic mayor and Republican governor “were happy” for him to send in national guard troops like he did in Washington D.C.
The announcement comes days after Memphis Mayor Paul Young confirmed in a statement to MLK50, a Memphis nonprofit news outlet, that his office, Gov. Bill Lee’s and the Trump administration were considering sending troops to Tennessee’s most populous city. 
Young did not respond to a request for comment by the Lookout, but told MLK50 he was “committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress.”
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in a statement to the Lookout that Trump’s decision to send troops was “disappointing and anti-Democratic.”
“The president sending troops to Tennessee will interfere and have a chilling effect on Tennesseans’ ability to exercise critical freedoms, such as the freedom to protest and the liberty to travel,” Harris said. “We will do everything in our power to prevent this incursion.”
Two weeks ago, Gov. Bill Lee told reporters Memphis crime had dropped by 15% in the last year and that he had no plans to deploy the Tennessee National Guard to the city, only to reverse course a week later, saying that anything was possible. 










This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low.


– Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis


A federal appeals court ruled that Trump’s decision to take over the National Guard and send troops into Los Angeles without the California governor’s permission was illegal. His administration is appealing the ruling. 
Trump also said he planned to deploy troops to Chicago but later backtracked. In Washington D.C., the president has more direct control of the presence of federal troops because the federal government reserves significant authority over governance of the city, which was established as a federal enclave separate from any of the states.
Tennessee’s state law says the governor can deploy the National Guard in an “invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, attack, or combination to oppose the enforcement of the law by force and violence.” But the deployment can not exceed the extent of the emergency.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee House speaker wants “strike force” to hit Memphis gangs

“This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low,” said Senate Minority Leader Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat. “That’s not leadership — that’s overreach.
The Lookout previously reported that Tennessee Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton favored sending federal and state troops to Memphis as a “strike force” to cut down on gang activity.
Rep. John Gillepsie, a Memphis Republican, said on social media he was “grateful” for the decision and that “arrests must be backed by tough prosecution and accountability in the courts.”
The last time the Tennessee National Guard was deployed to Memphis was in 1978, when a strike by city firefighters resulted in more than 100 fires throughout the city in a matter of days. Then-Mayor Wyeth Chandler declared a civil emergency, calling for a military presence and curfews for residents.

In January, New Mexico environment officials cited the base for a spill of wastewater containing firefighting foam with PFAS which soaked into the aquifer after a retaining pond leaked. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Alex Mercer)In mid-July, Neil Dolly left Albuquerque near dawn and headed to Clovis. Under the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, he and his co-workers with the New Mexico Environment Department have the authority to conduct surprise inspections of hazardous waste sites, take samples and shoot photos. 
Parked at a gas station near Cannon Air Force Base, Dolly called the base to confirm names and email addresses. About 30 minutes later, he emailed officials to say he was arriving. 
Once inside, base officials and attorneys told Dolly and his assistant they wouldn’t be allowed to collect soil and water samples to test for PFAS. According to Dolly, they cited ongoing litigation between the state and the Pentagon.
No one paying attention to New Mexico’s PFAS saga should be surprised that the military kept Dolly from doing his job. But we should all stay alert to how the U.S. government thwarts the ability — indeed, the right — of states to protect their lands, waters and people. 
Patented in the 1940s, PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances have been used since then in cookware, clothing, food wrappers, furniture and firefighting foams. The same qualities that make them useful — water and sunlight don’t destroy their molecules of joined carbon and fluorine atoms — also make them hard to clean up. Instead of breaking down over time, they move up the food chain, persisting in soils and waters and accumulating in the bodies of animals and humans. Some people refer to this toxic family as “forever chemicals.”
In 2018, the Air Force notified New Mexico officials that tests at Cannon — and Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo — detected perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Firefighting foams the military started using in the 1970s had contaminated groundwater with PFOA and PFOS, just two of the thousands of compounds in the PFAS family.  
When New Mexico called for cleanup, the U.S. Department of Defense sued, challenging the state’s authority. Currently, the state is part of a multi-district federal lawsuit seeking past and future clean-up costs and all natural resource damages at Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate. And in June, the state filed another lawsuit, ordering the Pentagon to clean up the plume at Cannon under a new law that clarifies the state’s ability to regulate hazardous PFAS, even if the federal government has neglected to set standards for the chemicals. 
By now, the contaminated plume is roughly six miles long, and New Mexicans have spent about $12 million on litigation. We’ve spent millions more testing well water and residents’ blood and connecting rural Curry County residents to a public water system because they can’t safely drink their well water.
“I spend a lot of time battling the PFAS monster that is just omnipresent every day with some new filing or some new denial of access or whatever it is,” NMED Secretary James Kenney told me in an interview. “There is no single more recalcitrant polluter, that is more litigious, than the Department of Defense.” 
Kenney says he’s frustrated that the Pentagon keeps trampling the rights of states like New Mexico that are grappling with PFAS contamination. “Where is this notion of cooperative federalism, that states rights are supreme when implementing federal law?” he asks. “I feel like the Department of Defense is giving the middle finger salute to Congress, and they’re OK with it.”
Meanwhile, the toxic chemicals have traveled beyond Cannon into the Ogallala Aquifer, and into the blood of people working on and living near the base. A few years ago, Art Schaap, whose dairy farm overlooks Cannon, euthanized 3,500 cows because their blood — and milk — was poisoned. 
More recently, the state released test results for 628 people who worked on or lived near Cannon, all but two of whom had at least one type of PFAS in their blood, and more than 90% of whom tested positive for multiple types of the toxic chemicals. 
PFAS’ threat to human health is well known. 
Beginning in the 1960s, manufacturers like 3M and DuPont knew from testing workers and nearby water supplies that different PFAS chemicals caused reproductive and development problems; birth defects; liver and kidney disease; and immune system problems. Additional studies have linked exposure to high cholesterol, low infant birth weights, and certain cancers, along with thyroid and hormone disruption.
As a longtime environment reporter, I have witnessed generations of state officials try to protect public health and rein in legacy pollution from federal installations. Despite the massive amount of money American taxpayers invest in the Pentagon — more than a trillion dollars this year alone — the federal government continues to punt on cleanup and put people, and our precious waters, at risk. 
At Kirtland Air Force Base, for example, 24 million gallons of jet fuel leaked into the aquifer — and still hasn’t been cleaned up. Los Alamos National Laboratory has long polluted tributaries of the Rio Grande, and few people want to consider what lies in the sediment at the bottom of Cochiti Lake. At White Sands Test Facility, the U.S. Army and NASA have contaminated groundwater with multiple pollutants. Confirmed PFAS contamination also has been established at Fort Wingate Depot, the Santa Fe Army Aviation Support Facility, the Army National Guard’s Roswell Field Maintenance Shop and White Sands Missile Range. 
New Mexico will become increasingly arid, and our water challenges will only get tougher. We can all see the parched forests and fields, shallow reservoirs and drying riverbeds. We should also be clear-eyed about the legacy of federal pollution, and what all that contaminated water means for the state’s future. That is water lost to farms, families and the future. And the recently renamed U.S. Department of War isn’t likely to prioritize cleanup anytime soon.
As the federal government openly challenges — or just ignores — the authority of states to protect their own lands, waters and people, New Mexicans can’t be kept in the dark about what we face from legacy or emerging pollutants. And New Mexicans on opposite sides of the political aisle should at least align with one another to protect the state’s waters. No matter what else is happening in the country, our water future here in New Mexico depends on transparency and unity.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pfasphoto.jpg,,,2025-09-12 13:56:56.277236

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A study by Iowa State University researchers shows the viability of using bio-oils to plug abandoned oil wells, an application that could drive economic growth for Iowans with farm and forest waste.
ISU mechanical engineering professor Mark Mba-Wright led a “techno-economic assessment” of technology that uses oil created from plant waste to fill orphan oil wells, or abandoned wells that need to be filled in, and sequester carbon dioxide.
Mba-Wright, who has studied bio-oils and its applications for more than a decade, said he was surprised to learn about this use of the materials when the carbon removal company Charm Industrial reached out about conducting the study. The fossil fuel and biofuel industries aren’t usually mentioned in connection with one another, he said.
“We’ve collaborated before, but this was certainly a novel application that we hadn’t considered before,” Mba-Wright said.

Bio-oils are created through a process called pyrolysis, Mba-Wright said, where plant debris is burned quickly at very high temperatures, producing both oil and biochar, a solid byproduct. Bio-oils are most commonly blended with crude oil to make cleaner gasoline and diesel. But recently, Mba-Wright said researchers have started looking to include bio-oils in chemical cement mixtures.
Charm Industrial has already started using bio-oils to fill wells, Mba-Wright said, but reached out to the ISU professor to analyze the prospects of creating mobile units the would gather and process biomass, then transport the oil to a central hub before it is injected into a well. The mobile pyrolysis units would be around the size of a combine and sit behind farm equipment to collect leftovers from harvest.
“They have units in operation and contracts in place, but they wanted to understand what is the long-term potential of making these on-site, small-scale pyrolysis units,” Mba-Wright said. “And so we have process models and financial models that can evaluate some of the configurations that we’re interested in.”
A proposed plan included in the study would involve at least 200 mobile units, according to the report, each with a processing capacity of 10 tons a day. At that capacity and with the units using debris from corn harvests, also known as corn stover, the study stated 5.3 tons of bio-oil and 2.5 tons of biochar would be created per day.
These units would cost between $1-$2 million to build, Mba-Wright said, and the study stated bio-oil would need to reach a minimum base selling price of at least $175 per ton. Capital costs would decrease over time as more units are made, according to the study, and the plan stacks up in terms of cost and productivity against other methods of carbon sequestration, like direct air capture.
The study stated there were more than 123,000 documented orphaned oil and gas wells in the U.S., but there could be between 310,000 and 800,000 undocumented wells that have been abandoned.
“Iowa State’s experts showed that bio-oil sequestration using corn stover can deliver a high-value, durable carbon removal product that outcompetes other technologies, while providing new markets for crop residues and delivering new economic value to the rural economy,” said Charm Industrial co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt in an ISU news release. “As the carbon-removal sector grows, Charm is grateful to work with farm and forest communities to grow this opportunity.”
Mba-Wright said the research team and company are having “ongoing conversations” about further research into pyrolysis and bio-oil through the ISU Bioeconomy Institute, a university center focused on using biomass and other renewable resources for economic and social development.
In addition to trapping carbon that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and plugging oil wells — which also leak emissions and can pose safety hazards — Mba-Wright said this use of biowaste could bring revenue and opportunities for new practices to Iowa farmers.
Corn stover is generally left to decay in the field, but Mba-Wright said farmers could earn money by letting the debris get picked up and turned into bio-oil. The biochar byproduct created through pyrolysis could go back to the farmer to be mixed in their soil. Mba-Wright said this could lower fertilizer costs and increase land values, but he said the team did not focus on these avenues in their recent work.
“It certainly adds value to a resource that’s underutilized in most fields,” Mba-Wright said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Mainers will be able to access COVID vaccines without a prescription, according to new guidance issued by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention under Gov. Janet Mills’ direction.
This fall, the Food and Drug Administration only approved the shots for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID, including seniors at least 65 years old or those who have health conditions. 
That means COVID vaccines aren’t broadly available to anyone ages 6 months and older anymore, which has been enforced in other states. 
Some national pharmacies, such as CVS, previously said they would only administer COVID-19 vaccines to people in Maine with prescriptions from their doctors, according to the Portland Press Herald. 
But the new order from Mills “serves as a prescription for all Maine people,” allowing them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacies, clinics, and health care offices across the state without a prescription from their health care provider, according to an announcement from herMills’ office Friday afternoon. 
“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Mills said in a statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”
The Maine Bureau of Insurance will also ensure that health insurance companies provide full coverage for COVID-19 vaccines without any cost sharing or prior authorization. MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, also covers COVID-19 vaccinations.
The availability of vaccines still remains under question despite the order. When Caitlin Gilmet, director for Maine Families for Vaccines and communications director for American Families for Vaccines, made an appointment last month for her family, including school-age children, to get the COVID vaccine this month, they received a notification that they needed to wait until the state was able to ensure that we’re able to get these vaccines.
“I’m super enthusiastic, both as a parent and a pro-vaccine advocate, to know that the governor’s office and Maine CDC acted so quickly to defend access to covid vaccines, especially with respiratory virus season starting and kids heading back to school,” she said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials have argued that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don’t necessarily need annual boosters anymore. But according to guidance from several national medical and public health organizations, including the Maine CDC,  “vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe COVID-19.”

I’m pretty big on Jesus. I’m also pretty uncomfortable with the message on that T-shirt. I’ve seen it before. It has been a focus by a group of pastors in Rapid City for several years.
When I got home from mass, I Googled “This city belongs …” and my computer quickly filled in the “to Jesus” and led me to a page (thiscitybelongstojesus.com) listing past and upcoming rallies here in Rapid City committed to dedicating the city to Jesus.
There is also a “This City Belongs to Jesus” Facebook page, with an introduction that reads: “This page is dedicated to the church of Rapid City coming together under the name of Jesus.”

Now, I hate to state the obvious, but Rapid City is, as its name suggests, a city, not a church. It shouldn’t be seen as a church. It shouldn’t be managed like a church. It is a community of people with different beliefs — including those on religion — and a framework of businesses and services and government to support and hopefully benefit all of us.
As a city, not a church.
Christianity is certainly the dominant religion here in Rapid City, as it is throughout South Dakota. But we Christians don’t represent everyone. And we shouldn’t try to impose our religious views on everyone, or anyone.
Nor should a mayor who happens to also have worked as a Christian minister act as a minister first and a mayor second. I’m not saying our current mayor does that. I bring him up only because before he was mayor, Jason Salamun was executive pastor at Fountain Springs Church. Sometimes he still sounds like a pastor, which is OK, up to a point.
It’s fine for government officials to be informed by their religious beliefs. It’s not fine at all when they try to impose them on others.
I love the idea of Christ being central to our lives. I certainly try to make him central to mine. But not everybody does. Not everybody believes what I believe, or what Salamun believes.
That’s why it’s so important to keep some space between religion and government. And it’s why I worry when religious leaders start talking about “the church of Rapid City” and the city belonging to Jesus.
When I saw the woman’s T-shirt the other day, I had to wonder: “OK, but what about Jews? What about Muslims? What about Hindus? What about Buddhists? What about Wiccans? (Yes, there are Wiccans here). What about agnostics and atheists?”
And, especially, given where we live, what about Indigenous people? Of course, many are Christian. But many others practice their own Native American spirituality, worshipping a creator who has nothing to do with Jesus. Imagine how they might feel when they see people wearing the “This City Belongs to Jesus” T-shirt.
Rapid City belongs to all of us residents, of course. It belongs to the rule of law, the state Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
Christians or not, we are all citizens of the same city, with the same rights and challenges and the same hopes and dreams for ourselves and our families. And we can all call this city our own.
This is a city issue that is also a state issue and a national issue. The promoters of Christian nationalism seek a dangerous convergence of government and religion. Christian religion, of course.
But this is a nation where our many freedoms are intended to include protection for those with different religious beliefs — or none at all — from a potentially oppressive religious majority.
We have seen what happens in other countries where religion and government become one. We should never want that here.
So when it comes to message T-shirts, I’d much prefer one that reads: “My heart belongs to Jesus, but my city belongs to everyone.”
That one I’d wear.

Proposition, or “prop,” betting is legal in Connecticut, but it is tightly regulated, especially when college sports are involved. 
Prop bets let people wager on specific in-game events, such as which team scores first, rather than simply who wins.
Connecticut authorized sports wagering in 2021. The Department of Consumer Protection allows prop betting on professional sports and most college games, but there are restrictions for in-state college teams such as UConn or Yale. Bettors cannot place prop wagers on individual Connecticut college athletes and cannot bet on single games involving in-state colleges. The only exception is for approved intercollegiate tournaments with at least four teams, and even then bets must cover the overall tournament outcome, not individual games.
Connecticut law also bans novelty prop bets, including wagers on the Super Bowl coin toss, halftime show, or similar entertainment outcomes, regardless of the event’s location.

Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.A progressive coalition of 20 Maine organizations opposed the nomination of a federal judge from Maine to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, citing his opposition of reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, and history of defending large corporations.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination of Portland-based lawyer Joshua Dunlap to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which covers Maine. Republican Sen. Susan Collins supported the nomination, saying Dunlap’s “professionalism and experience … make him an excellent choice for the First Circuit.” That court is the only one of the 13 federal appeals courts with no current judges appointed by Republican presidents.
On Friday, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England joined Equality Maine, Maine Women’s Lobby and Our Power Maine in urging Collins to vote against Dunlap, citing his anti-reproductive rights and anti-LGBTQ+ stances, including public opposition to marriage equality and support for fetal personhood. They criticized his record of consistently siding with large corporations over the interests of Maine residents and his affiliation with the Alliance Defending Freedom, designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Dunlap is currently a partner in the Portland law firm Pierce Atwood, and co-chairs its Appellate & Amici team. Two decades ago, Dunlap interned for the Alliance Defending Freedom, and when asked about it in a judiciary committee hearing in July, called ADF “a highly successful law firm.”
“Mainers need judges who reflect their views, especially in this moment when we are seeing the key role that the judiciary, courts and individual judges play in upholding democratic principles and constitutional rights in our fragile democracy,” said Lily James, advocacy coordinator for Maine Women’s Lobby.
“We are gravely concerned that, if confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Dunlap will become yet another judge who uses his position to take the side of banks, insurance companies and other corporations, instead of reflecting the values of Mainers and protecting the rights of individuals.”
National advocacy group Accountable.us also flagged Dunlap’s nomination, saying “Dunlap’s nomination is part of President Trump’s campaign to capture the courts with judges hand picked for their loyalty to Trump, instead of their commitment to the Constitution.”
“Joshua Dunlap has an alarming record of advancing anti-choice laws that would take fundamental freedoms away from Americans,” said President Caroline Ciccone. “His extreme ideological advocacy to gut reproductive freedom is out of step with the vast majority of Americans and calls into question his ability to rule impartially on the bench.”
Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment.
Opposition to reproductive rights
When reproductive health care providers are already fighting in federal courts to be able to continue providing care to millions of patients and LGBTQ+ rights under attack, “it is more essential than ever that the court serve as a neutral arbiter and that they maintain the ability to make decisions without bias or prejudice,” said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.
“The fact is, the statements that Mr. Dunlap has made over the years are deeply at odds with the values of Maine people and the rights they hold dear, and we have grave concern for his ability to be impartial on matters literal, matters of life and death, on which he has taken such extreme and public positions,” she said.
Accountable.us pointed to testimonies and articles by Dunlap, including a 2015 testimony in favor of a bill proposing a parental consent requirement for minors seeking abortions in 2015, where he said that doctors were financially incentivized to encourage young people to terminate their pregnancies, and stated that parental consent requirements were about protecting minors from abuse rather than providing an additional roadblock to abortion. 
In 2017, he signed onto a testimony supporting a Maine fetal personhood bill saying it was  “purely and simply” about ensuring justice in instances of wrongful death of a fetus. Opponents of the bill said that Maine law already provided avenues for legal action in such cases, and said that the bill could lead to abortion restrictions down the line. Neither bill ultimately passed.
Opposing marriage equality  
Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, said Dunlap’s actions and words “indicate that he would rule against non discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people, and roll back marriage equality.”
In an op ed in 2012, Dunlap publicly opposed marriage equality in Maine, complaining about supporters of marriage equality stealing opposing signs. 
“[Marriage equality] supporters vigorously assert that redefining marriage will not affect our rights,” he said in a letter to the editor.
“Yet … supporters have engaged in a concerted campaign to trample free speech by stealing signs. Their criminal behavior tells you everything you need to know about their commitment to freedom.”
He has been dismissive of same sex marriage supporters constitutional arguments, and suggested that he believes LGBTQ+ rights are inherently at odds with religious liberty, Drew said. As a lawyer and legal commentator, Dunlap has repeatedly fought for expansive religious exemptions that would allow people and institutions to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, claiming that religious motivation should be a valid legal defense.
“Dunlap has made clear that he prioritizes ideology over equality and justice,” Drew said. 
“His appointment would put LGBTQ+ people rights at risk, not only in the First Circuit, but across the country, undermining the court’s ability to safeguard the rights of marginalized people and women.”
Supporting big corporations 
Seth Berry, executive director of Our Power, cited examples where Dunlap supported Central Maine Power in overturning a voter-approved measure banning foreign governments and companies with 5% or more foreign government ownership from donating to state referendum races. The law was one of a handful around the country attempting to limit foreign influence on U.S. elections, but CMP’s parent company filed lawsuits to block its application. 
He also defended pharmaceutical companies in opioid cases, represented oil companies accused of climate deception, and sided with banks in foreclosure disputes. Berry argued that Dunlap’s confirmation would serve corporate interests at the expense of Mainers, urging senators not to support his nomination.
“If confirmed, Joshua Dunlap will be a blank check for corporate oligarchy,” he said. 
“U.S. senators who support him will sign the check, but the bills will be paid by Maine people.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)The U.S. Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed.
The data sharing comes after Justice Department attorneys this summer demanded that election officials in nearly two dozen states turn over their voter lists, alarming some Democratic state secretaries of state and election experts. They have voiced fears about how the Trump administration planned to use the data. Even some Republican secretaries of state have declined to provide their full voter lists.
Homeland Security in an unsigned statement to Stateline called information sharing essential to “scrub aliens from voter rolls” and said the federal government was “finally doing what it should have all along — sharing information to solve problems.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

“This collaboration with the DOJ will lawfully and critically enable DHS to prevent illegal aliens from corrupting our republic’s democratic process and further ensure the integrity of our elections nationwide. Elections exist for the American people to choose their leaders, not illegal aliens,” the statement reads.
The Justice Department said in its own statement that state voter roll data provided in response to requests from the department’s Civil Rights Division is “being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Noncitizen voting is extremely rare. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
The data sharing marks a next step in President Donald Trump’s efforts to exert more federal influence over state-administered elections. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year that sought to require individuals to provide proof-of-citizenship documents to register to vote, a rule quickly blocked in federal court. He has also threatened to sign another executive order attempting to restrict mail ballots.
At least 10 states have either provided publicly available data or given the department directions on how to request public data. It’s unclear whether any state has turned over voter data with all information the Trump administration is seeking.
While the administration didn’t describe how Homeland Security will use the voter rolls to search for noncitizens, the agency operates a powerful program, Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, that can identify the immigration or citizenship status of an individual.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if officials upload the data.
In the past, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm U.S. citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information.
As the Justice Department has sought state voter rolls this summer, letters from the department’s attorneys to state officials in many instances have demanded full lists of registered voters that include sensitive personal information such as driver license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. At least 22 states were asked for some data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which is tracking the requests.
Some states have turned over publicly available voter files or offered directions on how to request them. Others have flat-out refused the requests.
“The Department of Justice hasn’t shown any good reason for its fishing expedition for sensitive voter information on every American,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said in a news release Monday announcing that her office had rejected the Justice Department’s second request for her state’s voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said that he has no confidence that Homeland Security would act carefully with any data received.
Levitt, speaking with Stateline on Wednesday before the data sharing was confirmed, voiced concern that the Justice Department was “serving as a stalking horse” for other entities within the government.
“The fact that they’re having to sneak through the back door rather than knocking on the front door tells you that there’s improper procedures going on,” Levitt said.

More than 13,000 students have enrolled in their first year at a state university this fall, taking their first steps into a new chapter in their lives in Ames, Cedar Falls or Iowa City from across the state, country and world. The universities have boasted record-breaking numbers and continued positive trends in their new and total enrollment, from new or transfer students to undergraduates, graduate or professional students.

University of Iowa
Brent Gage, UI associate vice president for enrollment management, said in a news release the university received more than 31,000 first-year student applications ahead of the fall 2025 semester, a record-breaking number.
Of the 5,561 first-year students enrolled at the UI this fall — the university’s second-largest incoming class in its history — 2,879 are state residents and 1,260 come from rural areas. The university reported in the release new students are moving to Iowa City from 93 Iowa counties, 47 U.S. states and territories and 37 countries.
Around one-fifth of the population identified themselves as first-generation students, according to the release, and the class’s average grade-point average came in at 3.86.
Total enrollment at the UI for this fall is 31,563, including 23,407 undergraduates, 6,269 graduate students and 1,887 professional students. Nearly 3,140 medical residents and postdoctoral students call the UI home as well.
“Interest in attending the University of Iowa has never been greater, and this group of students represents talented students from Iowa, across the nation, and around the world,” Gage said in the release. “We are excited to welcome one of the largest first-year classes that we have ever had as they join the Hawkeye community this fall.”
Iowa State University
ISU total enrollment numbers have grown for the third straight year, according to a news release from the university, supported by the incoming class and high second-year retention. The university’s incoming class hit 6,160 this fall, its fifth year in a row of growing first-year cohorts and the largest class ISU has seen since 2016.
More than half of the incoming class are Iowans, according to the release, and all 99 Iowa counties and all 50 U.S. states are represented among new students, as well as 110 countries.
Just over 20% of new students are first-generation, 22% identified as Pell-eligible and 80% are receiving some form of financial aid through scholarships or grants. Nearly three-quarters of 26,346 undergraduate students are receiving financial aid.
The class of 2029 enrolled at ISU with an average ACT score of 25 and grade-point average of 3.76. More than half of the 1,351 transfer students attending ISU this fall came from state community colleges, the release stated.
Of the 31,105 students enrolled at ISU, 4,116 are graduate students and 643 are studying professional veterinary medicine.
“We are proud of the continued growth in enrollment,” said Katharine Johnson Suski, interim associate vice president for enrollment management and executive director of admissions and new student programs, in the release. “That growth reflects our commitment to serving the state with more students from Iowa high schools and community colleges choosing Iowa State.”
University of Northern Iowa
UNI’s sesquicentennial class totals 1,549 students, according to a news release, the third year in a row the university topped 1,500 with its incoming cohorts. Despite increases in new undergraduate and graduate students, bringing their totals to 7,800 and 1,404, respectively, its total enrollment of 9,204 fell short of last year’s total of 9,283.
More than 90% of incoming students are from Iowa, the release stated, representing all 99 counties. The new class also includes students from 42 U.S. states and 53 countries.
“We couldn’t be more excited to welcome our 150th class of UNI students to campus,” said UNI President Mark Nook in the release. “We are particularly encouraged that the numbers of our incoming freshmen, transfers and new graduate students have all increased compared to last year.”
Nearly 75% of new transfer students are coming to UNI from a community college through the UNI@IACC program, a partnership between the Cedar Falls university and Iowa community colleges to ease transfers between the institutions. According to the release, enrollment in the program has grown from 252 students after its launch in 2022 to 539 in 2025. Since its inception, the release stated 348 students have graduated from the program.
UNI also saw increased interest from states bordering Iowa this year, a result the release attributes to the college’s neighboring state tuition rate program, which offers in-state tuition to students applying from Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota and Missouri.

Because program was conceived in response to a big stink about elk numbers and damage, Game and Fish commissioner is 'shocked' by the absence of claims. 
The post No one is using a controversial compensation program for grass lost to overpopulated Wyoming elk appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s been virtually no interest in a new state program to provide financial relief to stockgrowers whose rangelands are grazed by overpopulated elk herds, according to Wyoming wildlife officials. 
The payment program’s slow uptake took some members of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission by surprise at a Tuesday meeting in Lander. 
“I guess I’m shocked,” Ken Roberts said.
The Game and Fish commissioner from Kemmerer noted the “urgency” portrayed by “a lot of folks” who were “adamant that this had to be done.” Most of the pressure for the compensation came from landowners who’ve struggled to run cattle amid overpopulated elk herds in central and eastern Wyoming.

Game and Fish’s deputy chief of wildlife, Craig Smith, led the conversation and was quick to note that zero claims were filed in the first year of the new policy. Some landowners had inquired about how it works, he said.
Adjustments to Game and Fish’s compensation for “extraordinary damage to rangelands” trace back to summer 2023, when there was a tense Wyoming legislative meeting about elk damage. The following legislative session, the Agriculture Committee brought an unsuccessful but controversial bill that would have mandated compensation rates for grass on dry rangeland lost to elk inside overpopulated big game herd units. Then in fall 2024, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission voluntarily updated its compensation regulations in an effort to placate ranchers and keep lawmakers at bay.  
The compensation plan is specific to non-cultivated livestock rangeland, and there are several requirements: 

Landowners can receive “extraordinary damage to grass” funds when a big game herd is overpopulated by 20% or more for three or more consecutive years and the species is consuming 15% or more of the estimated forage on private ground. (Payments are still possible when herds are not overpopulated if more than 30% of the forage is being consumed.)
Landowners must also allow a “sufficient number of hunters” on the property. That means the necessary number of hunters to offset the “recruitment,” or the number of animals born into the population that survived one year. 

When the new rules were being vetted with the public, they proved widely unpopular with sportspeople — 46 of the 48 public comments on the draft regulation that stated a position opposed the new payment program. The unpopularity stemmed partly from worries that the damage claims could exacerbate an emerging Game and Fish budget crunch. 
“It was supposed to be a substantial amount,” Roberts told WyoFile. 
Although perplexing, the lack of interest is also a relief, he said: “I’m glad to hear it.”

Wyoming Stock Growers Association lobbyist Jim Magagna, who was a major proponent of the legislation and Game and Fish policy change, shared the view.
“I’m certainly glad it didn’t result in a flood of demands for compensation that would overwhelm the available funds,” he said. 
Magagna partly attributed the absence of claims to unfamiliarity with the new funding stream. 
“Landowners are not yet fully aware of that opportunity,” Magagna told WyoFile. “As an organization, we try to keep people aware of things, but we certainly didn’t put anything out encouraging people to apply for damages— it’s an individual decision.”
Wyoming Game and Fish, he added, has also come through in helping frustrated ranchers address overpopulated elk herds via other efforts. 
“The Game and Fish have been responsive with granting licenses to landowners, and they’re even bringing in professional hunters to remove elk,” Magagna said. “If the wildlife populations can be appropriately managed and the claims go away, that’s better for everyone.”

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal judges in Rhode Island and Washington have blocked the Trump administration from excluding people without legal immigration status from a group of federal programs, including Head Start early childhood education.
On Wednesday, a federal judge in Rhode Island halted a broad array of rules based on the new immigration restrictions from taking effect. Wisconsin was one of 21 states and the District of Columbia to join that lawsuit.  
Reuters reported that a White House statement said the administration expected a higher court to reverse the decision.
On Thursday, a federal judge in the state of Washington ordered the Trump administration to pause a requirement that Head Start early childhood education programs exclude families without legal immigration status. That ruling came in a case brought by Head Start groups in four states, including Wisconsin.
Head Start programs were included in a broader federal directive that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued July 10 listing federally funded “public benefits” that must exclude immigrants without legal status under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.
Certain programs, such as Medicaid, have been required to verify lawful immigration status for participants. But since 1998, the federal government has considered a range of programs exempt that are generally open to all in a community, according to Reuters.
The July HHS order revoked the 1998 policy and closed the door to immigrants lacking legal status for Head Start along with a collection of programs providing mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and other assistance.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy issued a preliminary injunction that halted orders from HHS as well as the departments of Education, Labor and Justice based on the policy shift.
“The Government’s new policy, across the board, seems to be this: ‘Show me your papers,'” McElroy wrote in her order.
McElroy wrote that the administration acted “in a rushed way, without seeking comment from the public or interested parties,” likely violating the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez issued a temporary restraining order directing HHS not to apply the immigration restriction to Head Start programs.
Head Start programs have never been required to determine the immigration status of families in the program since it started nearly 60 years ago, according to Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
The Wisconsin association joined the lawsuit against the HHS order filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of Head Start programs in the states of Washington, Illinois and Pennsylvania as well as advocacy groups in California and Oregon.
“This ruling affirms what we know to be both right within the law and right for communities,” Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner on Friday. “Keeping eligible Head Start Families in the program is the best outcome for Wisconsin. Kids are safer and it keeps Wisconsin working.”
Martinez wrote in a 26-page opinion focused on the Head Start portion in the HHS order that harms the plaintiffs warned of “are not merely speculative.” Martinez was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed in 2004.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs told the court that a Wisconsin Head Start program reported at least four families withdrew after the federal directive was issued. Several Pennsylvania programs reported withdrawals, one reported that it expects to have to close and another said it will have to close one of its rooms due to a drop in enrollment.
The plaintiffs’ arguments “detail confusion on how to comply with the Directive, how to verify immigration status, who status is based on, whether non-profits are exempt, difficulties in recruiting and families obtaining proper documentation, and the families’ overall fear that reporting immigration status will result in a choice between family safety and a child’s education,” Martinez wrote.
The directive has unclear guidance and has had a “chilling effect” on programs as well as on families who have relied on Head Start, resulting “in the immediate harm of childhood education loss” and “leading to long-term harms in development,” he wrote. “It also results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families.”

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Parole Board will hold clemency hearings later this month for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, whose execution is scheduled for Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. 
The board announced this week that the five-member panel will conduct a clemency interview hearing at the prison on Friday, Sept. 19 at 10 a.m. Central Time.
A public clemency hearing will follow on Monday, Sept. 22, at the Indiana Government Center South Auditorium in Indianapolis. Testimony in support of clemency will be allowed from 9 to 11 a.m., followed by testimony in opposition from 1 to 3 p.m.
Ward, 44, was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. His case has played out through state and federal courts for more than two decades. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.
Execution moves forward as questions linger around Indiana’s lethal injection drugs

In late August, the Indiana Supreme Court finalized his October execution date after denying his latest appeal.
The clemency process is one of the final steps available for prisoners to avoid a death sentence. 
The Parole Board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor. 
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether. 
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Benjamin Ritchie, and Gov. Mike Braun allowed his execution to proceed.
Ward’s legal counsel is continuing to raise questions about Indiana’s lethal injection procedures and has repeatedly pressed for records detailing the state’s supply of pentobarbital — the drug used in executions — especially about its quality and whether it has expired.
The inmate’s defense team said they also plan to pursue additional legal challenges in state and federal courts in the weeks leading up to the execution.
Braun said earlier this month that Indiana’s Department of Correction does not yet have the necessary execution drugs in hand.
When asked about the state’s drug supply, the governor reiterated that Indiana is taking steps to ensure doses do not expire before use.

MONTPELIER — The U.S. Department of Justice this week asked Vermont to hand over sensitive personal information on all of the state’s registered voters, Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas said Friday.
The secretary also said she intends to reject the justice department’s request. That’s in line with public statements she made last month, after her office received a separate but related inquiry from the feds about the possibility of information-sharing.
Copeland Hanzas’ office received a letter from the department’s civil division on Monday asking it to furnish the voter data, she said.
The secretary said her office is working with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office to draft a formal reply, which she expects to send soon.

A federal judge in July ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the nation’s largest abortion provider fights Trump’s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.
Medicaid is a government health care program that serves millions of low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly half of Planned Parenthood’s patients rely on Medicaid.
A provision in Trump’s tax bill instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah filed a lawsuit in July against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“While the Trump administration wants to rip away reproductive freedom, we’re here to say loud and clear: we will not back down,” Dominique Lee, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said in a statement. “This is not over.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to an online request for comment.
Planned Parenthood said Thursday’s ruling means that more than 1.1 million patients can’t use their Medicaid insurance at its health centers. That also puts as many as 200 of those health centers at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood said in a statement.

Chris Winters, commissioner of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, plans to step down. 
Instead, he is set to become deputy commissioner of the Department of Labor on Sept. 22, Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday in a press release. 
Scott also appointed Rick Hildebrant to lead the Department of Health. Hildebrant works as the chief medical information officer and medical director of hospital medicine at Rutland Regional Medical Center. His appointment takes effect Oct. 13. 
Hildebrant replaces Mark Levine, the face of Vermont’s Covid-19 response, who retired in March. 
“Even as public health leadership faces challenges nationally, Vermont has consistently demonstrated that collaboration, science, and community can chart a different course,” Hildebrant said in the release. 
Winters, who previously served as deputy secretary of state, took over DCF in 2023 after an unsuccessful bid to become secretary of state. Sandi Hoffman, deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, is slated to take over for Winters in an interim capacity at the department, which, among other responsibilities, oversees economic benefits, some social services and child welfare. 
In the release, Scott thanked Winters for his “steady leadership.” 
DCF’s top position is widely considered one of the most difficult in state government, and Winters has faced challenges during his tenure. 
The department oversees Vermont’s motel voucher program, which puts unhoused residents in motel rooms across the state. The program is a lightning rod for lawmakers and Scott, and as it’s downsized, Winters’ department has taken flak for the waves of motel evictions that pushed people to live outside. 
In January, the ACLU of Vermont sued DCF for allegedly tracking the pregnancies of Vermonters deemed “high-risk” and seeking custody of an unborn child. That litigation remains ongoing. 
At the Department of Labor, Winters will work under Kendal Smith, who previously served as deputy commissioner and interim commissioner, and whom Scott appointed in an official capacity Friday.

Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education […],"Kansas deaf education task force member Kylie Stewart, center, said the state needed to address the teacher shortage in deaf education. She said the School for the Deaf student deficits in reading and math assessments needed to be a priority of the Kansas State Board of Education and the Kansas Legislature. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — Lack of a Kansas-based bachelor’s degree program to prepare specialists in teaching of deaf or hard of hearing students complicates the challenge of hiring fully qualified staff at the Kansas School for the Deaf.
Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education issues also say uncompetitive salaries at the state’s school for 150 elementary and secondary students in Olathe made it challenging to attract educators once they’ve completed bachelor’s or master’s degrees in other states.
One member of the task force, which met at the School for the Deaf on Thursday to work on reform recommendations, said it was time the state Board of Education amended unrealistic licensing standards that made it too arduous for people drawn to the field of deaf education to secure mandated graduate-level credentials.
“The real-world impact of that is KSD can’t find teachers,” said Zach Wentz, a task force member representing School for the Deaf parents. “As a result they don’t do performance reviews the way that they’re supposed to and, so actually, you have teachers who shouldn’t be here because they’re not being held accountable. You’re motivating the school to make that decision because they know they can’t replace them if they get rid of them.”
Members of the task force likewise suggested Kansas begin subsidizing tuition and fees for students enrolled in deaf education programs.
In addition, task force members said, the state could pay stipends to out-of-state student teachers who would complete that undergraduate obligation at School for the Deaf and possibly remain in Kansas to take these hard-to-fill special education jobs.
Only 165 of the state’s 36,000 licensed classroom teachers hold a license for deaf education, according to the Kansas Department of Education.
“If that’s your kid sitting in that classroom, you’re thinking, can the state not figure out a way to simplify this a little bit but still ensure that teachers have their skills? That almost seems like a no-win situation right now with the teacher shortage,” said Kylie Stewart, a task force member and a college special education instructor.
She said changes need to be made to improve reading and math assessment scores for students enrolled there.
Luanne Barron, superintendent of the School for the Deaf, said 57% of the current staff at the school had dual licenses to teach in the education field and to instruct deaf students. The remainder of the school’s staff lacked a portion of that licensing package, she said, but were allowed to provide instruction on a temporary basis.
“One thing that I think that Kansas really needs to invest the time and energy into is … identifying a university who will take the lead and house a deaf ed program,” Barron said.
She said the University of Kansas’ decision to phase out its deaf education degree in 2019 after a long period of declining enrollment took away a cadre of students who could complete student teaching requirements at School for the Deaf.
“The last few years,” she said, “we haven’t had anybody come as a student teacher.”
Shane Carter, director of teacher licensing in the Kansas State Department of Education, told the task force that establishing a bachelor’s degree in deaf education at a Kansas college or university was a “very sound” strategy.
He pushed back on the idea Kansas education licensure standards were driving the shortage of deaf education professionals in the state.
To help fill the more immediate teacher gap, the School for the Deaf superintendent said, Kansas should consider authorizing the awarding of certificates in deaf education after completion of a certain number of specialized courses. Or, she said, the state could allow individuals to take a comprehensive exam to demonstrate proficiency in the instruction of deaf students.
“The problem is convincing universities to set up some sort of certificate program, while also convincing the (state) Board of Education to accept it. You have to do both,” Barron said.
Lisa Karney, the task force chair who holds master’s degrees in special education and deaf education, said it would be a mistake to make changes that compromised academic rigor of teacher preparation requirements.
In part, she said, her hesitancy to embrace sweeping licensing changes reflected the immersive educational demands placed on teachers at the School for the Deaf.
“It’s crucial that you keep the rigor,” Karney said. “There’s the whole spectrum that has to be looked at and offered and taught.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wentz-Stewart-Carter-deaf-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 11:58:28.437606

(Phil McKenna/Inside Climate News)CAMERON — Ray Mallett started fishing near the mouth of the Calcasieu River more than half a century ago as part of the “mosquito fleet,” a ragtag group of kids that plied the surrounding rivers and bayous in small motorboats in search of crabs.
A Gulf Coast fisherman like his father before him, Mallett harvested shrimp for decades from an estuary in Southwest Louisiana that was once the seafood capital of America.
Now, he can hardly catch enough shrimp to pay for fuel.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

“Each year we’re getting less and less,” Mallett said, standing at the helm of his boat, Cajun Memories. The name is a nod to his roots, and as one of the last remaining shrimp boats in Cameron’s port, a once-thriving fishery.
Harvests from the Calcasieu River, where shrimp migrate each year to spawn, have declined for decades as chemical plants and refineries located farther upstream have polluted the Calcasieu, making it one of the country’s most endangered rivers.
Catches dropped even further in recent years and Mallett, along with an increasingly vocal group of fishermen, has theories about why.
It’s “because of the … darn plant,” said Mallett, a slight but sinewy 63-year-old with a grey goatee and the image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns tattooed on his forearm.
The plant he’s referring to is Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass, a sprawling 432-acre liquefied natural gas terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River. The export terminal has loaded hundreds of ocean-going vessels with LNG fuel since operations began in 2022, helping to make the U.S. the world’s largest exporter of LNG. But the facility also brought noise and pollution; according to local fishermen, the industrial activity drives off shrimp.
“The shrimp don’t want to cross that barrier for some reason,” Mallett said.
“If there’s not many that come in to spawn, to have babies that go back out, you’re gonna get less and less each year,” Mallett added. “And that’s exactly what happened.”

Jeffrey Plumlee, a researcher at Louisiana State University and a fisheries extension specialist for Louisiana Sea Grant, said much remains unknown about the impact of the construction and operation of the terminals.
“The impact of LNG, specifically, these plants, has not been measured,” Plumlee said. “We don’t really have any great answers.”
Phillip Dyson grew up fishing alongside Mallett. He quit school at 13 to become a shrimper and has fished the inland waters of the Calcasieu River for the past 50 years. Before the plant was built, his boat brought in $125,000 to $175,000 per year. In 2023, Dyson said he made less than half that. Last year, he barely made enough to survive.
“Every year it drops and drops,” said Dyson, 63, standing next to one of his family’s shrimp boats, Papa’s Shadow, which is overdue for repainting and maintenance that Dyson says he can no longer afford. “If it wasn’t for Social Security, I’d go bankrupt.”

An average of 1.5 million pounds of shrimp were harvested from the Calcasieu Basin each year between 2015 and 2024, according to Peyton Cagle, the marine fisheries operations program manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. The figure dropped to just 750,000 pounds in 2024, or half of the 10-year average, he said.
However, Cagle said the changes in the harvest cannot be attributed to a single cause.
“Lower dockside prices, increased expenses, market competition from imported shrimp, and a reduction in the fleet are some of the reasons for the decline in landings,” Cagle said in a written statement.
While shrimp harvests were down 50% in the Calcasieu Basin in 2024, they also declined by an average of nearly 30% across all of coastal Louisiana last year, Cagle added.

Venture Global is now building Calcasieu Pass 2, a second LNG terminal adjacent to its existing facility, which will have double the export capacity. The plant is part of a massive expansion of new LNG terminals along the Gulf Coast, which will more than double America’s already world-leading export capacity.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects and has approved more than 99 percent of all project applications in recent decades, authorized construction for Calcasieu Pass 2 in June 2024.
However, the decision wasn’t unanimous.
The project’s adverse environmental and local economic impacts “are so great that I am compelled to find that approving the project is inconsistent with the public interest,” Allison Clements, a former FERC commissioner, wrote in her dissent just days before her four-year term at the agency ended.
“The Order improperly discounts impacts to commercial fishing businesses, which will likely be significant,” Clements added.
Dredging near the terminal is a primary concern noted in FERC’s Environmental Impact Statement for the project.
Approximately 6.4 million cubic yards of material — enough to fill 1,957 Olympic-sized swimming pools — will be excavated to create deep water berths for LNG vessels to dock and turn around at the terminal, according to the commission’s assessment.

Dredging would kick up sediment in the water, which may affect the health of shrimp, fish and other marine species by clogging their gills and reducing dissolved oxygen levels, according to the report.
Environmental advocates and state regulators have expressed concern about dredging, particularly during the migration periods for fish and shrimp, which coincide with the spring and fall commercial shrimp harvesting seasons.
In a March 2023 letter to the commission, Randell Myers, an assistant secretary with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked if Venture Global would consider limiting dredging activity to times of year that would not interfere with migration periods for shrimp and other species, as well as commercial fishing.
In its final assessment, FERC noted that the company didn’t anticipate any pauses on dredging during seasonal migration periods. The commission stated that doing so would leave the dredged area exposed to “tidal, wind, and wave action” over a longer period, potentially several months, which could exacerbate sedimentation issues.
Michael Tritico, a former coastal zone manager for southwest Louisiana tasked with protecting and developing the region’s natural resources and an environmental advocate, said not pausing during key migration periods is “the cheap way out.”
“It’s inconvenient and costs more to have the work crew leave and come back later,” Tritico said. “It’s an economic thing, and it’s not a logical scientific argument.”
Venture Global did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Plumlee said shrimp are often referred to as a “year crop” in that they live for approximately one year and their population is replenished annually. Each female shrimp releases up to a million eggs. If even a small portion of the estuary’s shrimp population can migrate in and out of the river mouth, the population will likely remain stable over time, he said.
As long as the resources juvenile shrimp need to develop, including good marsh habitat, tidal water flows and food, remain, “then I foresee them recovering quickly.”
Environmental advocates said the increased ship traffic from additional LNG terminals, not counting any disruptions from the facilities themselves, will have lasting impacts from which the shrimp may never recover.
Venture Global has plans for Calcasieu Pass 3, a third LNG export terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River with potential export capacity nearly equal to that of its first two terminals combined. In addition, Commonwealth LNG, an export terminal on the opposite bank of the Calcasieu River from Venture Global’s facilities, received final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy on Aug. 29 and may soon begin construction. Each of these facilities will draw massive oceangoing vessels to the rivermouth.
“They want to [add] six, seven, eight more ships every day,” said James Hiatt, founder of For a Better Bayou, a local environmental and community advocacy organization. “What you’ll have is just an insane amount of ship traffic in a place that is feeling effects of the traffic we already have. At what point is enough enough?”

In February 2023, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory committee to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, sent a letter to state and federal agencies responsible for permitting Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG export terminal, warning about the potential impact of this and other proposed LNG terminals.
“This is a radical transformation of the Louisiana coast,” the letter, signed by Acy Cooper, then chairman of the task force and a commercial shrimper, stated. “If successful, this construction and expansion will destroy the shrimping community in Cameron Parish and have serious consequences throughout the State.”
The letter ended with a warning. If the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries waits to assess the damage from gas export facilities until after they are constructed, it “will be far too late.”
Cagle, of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, said the agency conducts biweekly or monthly monitoring of shrimp abundance and size and has not seen “any alarming reductions” since construction of Calcasieu Pass and Calcasieu Pass 2 began.










What you’ll have is just an insane amount of ship traffic in a place that is feeling effects of the traffic we already have. At what point is enough enough?

If the department notices any impacts after Calcasieu Pass 2 is constructed, they would initiate an impact analysis at that time, Cagle said.
Since writing the letter, the task force, as well as the Louisiana Shrimp Association, an industry group also headed by Cooper, have focused more on the issue of low-cost shrimp imported to the U.S. from aquaculture farms in Asia.
Imports began in large numbers in the 1990s and have continued to climb, reaching 93 percent of all shrimp consumed in the U.S. in 2024, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, causing a steep and decades-long decline in the price of U.S.-caught shrimp, according to a federal fisheries report published in August.
The Shrimp Association praised a 50% tariff the Trump administration placed on imports from India, the largest importer of shrimp to the U.S, on Aug. 27. However, the group didn’t comment when President Trump issued an executive order in January lifting a Biden administration pause on U.S. Department of Energy permits for new LNG export terminals, including Calcasieu Pass 2.
LNG terminals require federal approval from FERC and the DOE. A DOE permit for Venture Global’s new facility was issued in March, which, along with FERC approval in May, allowed for construction to begin.
Cooper said the LNG issue hasn’t been on the association’s agenda for a while.
State regulators halted dredging in the Calcasieu River near the proposed CP2 terminal on August 8 after fishermen reported sediment from the project spilled beyond its intended containment area in a nearby wildlife refuge. The dredging was conducted by the Cameron Parish Port, Harbor and Terminal District in conjunction with Venture Global, which funded the project and maintained the pipe used to transport the sediment to the refuge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Patrick Courreges, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, said further dredging would be suspended until state and federal regulators approved a process for collecting and returning the lost dredge material.
For a Better Bayou, and Earthjustice said the spill was impacting crab, oyster and shrimp fisheries and was a potential violation of the Clean Water Act. The organizations submitted a letter to the state department of energy and natural resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last month seeking immediate enforcement action, including civil penalties.
The environmental assessment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects, also noted that prolonged exposure to elevated noise from dredging, pile driving and other construction activity can interfere with an animal’s behavior, such as “migrating, feeding, resting, or reproducing.”
State and federal permits for the project set limits on noise pollution from the facility’s construction and operation as measured at nearby onshore locations. However, there are no noise limits for the marine environment. Habitat Recovery Project, a local conservation organization that works with local fishermen and women, received a grant from the American Geophysical Union last October to measure noise pollution in the water and its impact on marine life.
The monitoring work will be aided and expanded to assess other potential stressors to fisheries in the Lower Calcasieu River through a grant from the Community Resilience Center at The Water Institute, a research organization based in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Alyssa Portaro, executive director of Habitat Recovery Project, said she hopes the projects will provide the scientific data necessary to establish guardrails on LNG developments, such as seasonal restrictions on dredging or time-of-day restrictions on tanker movements, which would reduce the facilities’ impact on shrimp and other marine life.
“That would be a win for me,” Portraro said.
Others are less optimistic.
“This is not an industry that can peacefully coexist,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. “They’ve just gotten started.”
Environmental advocates continue to push back. Commercial fishermen, impacted landowners, and environmental groups are continuing their lawsuit against FERC over its approval of the Calcasieu Pass 2 terminal.
Meanwhile, Earthjustice is challenging the project’s dredging permits issued by the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The Sierra Club and other environmental organizations recently filed suit against the state’s Department of Environmental Quality over the project’s air permits. At the same time, Habitat Recovery Project, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and the Environmental Law Clinic at Tulane University submitted a notice of intent to sue Venture Global for violations of the Clean Air Act at its existing Calcasieu Pass facility.
The Bucket Brigade, an environmental group based in New Orleans, previously noted more than 2,000 instances where emissions from the facility exceeded allowable limits during the facility’s first year of operation. The environmental groups haven’t yet filed their lawsuit; however, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has since sent Venture Global a notice of potential penalties for its emissions.
For Ray Mallett and the other fishermen, any relief from additional LNG development on the Calcasieu River can’t come soon enough. When the inshore shrimp season opened on August 11, Mallett loaded his boat, Cajun Memories, with several days’ worth of supplies and headed east toward Vermilion Bay, a 12-and-a-half-hour journey, in search of shrimp.
“I couldn’t make any money here,” Mallet said. “I had to go elsewhere.”

You can read more about the section here.

I’m a retired pediatrician and current medical educator. I’ve dedicated my life to caring for patients, training the next generation of physicians and advocating for healthcare access.
I also happen to live with a disability and use a wheelchair. For me, Medicaid is much more than a policy issue—it’s personal.
Despite the passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the most significant reductions in Medicaid funding will not take effect for at least two years, giving Congress an opportunity to correct its own mistake. Congress should mitigate the impacts of this legislation to help ensure patient access to care.
Beyond providing care for half of America’s children, Medicaid covers older adults, those in between jobs and people living with disabilities. Many of the people I’ve worked with – although not technically “disabled” – are still unable to work full time due to undiagnosed health conditions, limited access to employment and other barriers. Medicaid is often the only safeguard standing between them and disaster.
I often reflect on my early experience as a pediatrician during the rollout of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in the late 1990s. Until then, I had assumed most children had coverage, but when my clinic began accepting CHIP, I saw just how many families had been previously left behind.
That moment showed me just how essential healthcare advocacy is in my profession, which is why I strive to instill a passion for advocacy in the next generation of doctors.
Medicaid plays an outsized role in states like Mississippi where 60% of its recipients live in a rural area. In these underserved areas, Medicaid keeps clinics open and doctors caring for patients. Cutting the program now, when Americans and our healthcare systems are already struggling, would be heartbreaking.
Pediatric practices like mine will struggle to provide access, diagnoses and treatments might come later and at increased cost, and families will lose access to preventive care that keeps children out of the hospital.
My decades of work in Mississippi, particularly with children facing chronic conditions, have shown me how essential Medicaid remains.
Now, I’m deeply disappointed that the national conversation has shifted from expanding Medicaid access to protecting its survival.
After years working with civic and medical leaders to broaden Medicaid coverage, I now find myself forced to defend the program’s very existence.
Beyond providing for children, Mississippi nursing homes depend on Medicaid more than almost any other state, with nearly three in four residents enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would result in fewer staff and reduced services while placing a larger strain on facilities. Furthermore, even though seniors and people with disabilities make up just 35% of enrollees, they account for 66% of total Medicaid spending, illustrating the program’s role in supporting these vulnerable groups.
Although the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has been signed into law, implementation of Medicaid cuts still hangs in the balance. For example, of the nearly $1 trillion that is currently expected to be cut, the most impactful provisions won’t take place until 2027 or 2028, such as caps on provider taxes and state-directed payments, which help keep rural clinics open and operating.
Congress has ample time to reverse course and put patients first. Before the full severity of these cuts are implemented, lawmakers should roll back harmful cuts and changes to Medicaid to safeguard all Americans, as well as the hospitals and health systems that children, families and seniors depend on.

Law enforcement arrested Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident. He was booked into the Utah County Jail.
“We got him,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said.
Kirk, a widely known and often polarizing conservative activist known for debating students on college campuses, was shot and killed during a Turning Point USA public speaking event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, unleashing a search that involved more than 20 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI also offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the shooter.

According to Cox, a family member turned Robinson in. The suspect’s family member contacted the Washington County Sheriff’s Office saying Robinson had confessed or implied he had shot Kirk.
The information was relayed to investigators at the FBI and Utah Valley University, who reviewed additional surveillance footage from the university and identified Robinson arriving on campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at about 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

The family member who sent the tip said Robinson had become more political in recent years and that prior to Wednesday, he had mentioned Kirk’s visit to Utah Valley University.
“Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate. The family member also confirmed Robinson had a gray Dodge Challenger,” Cox said.
Messages shared with law enforcement by Robinson’s roommate included Discord messages from Robinson “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.”
The messages also referred to engraving bullets.
Cox said inscriptions on the shell casings included messages like “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao” and “if you read this, you are gay LMAO.”
Charging documents may be filed early next week, Cox said.

“This is a very sad day for, again, for our country, a terrible day for the state of Utah, but I’m grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation’s history,” Cox said.
FBI Director Kash Patel, who traveled to Utah during the investigation, thanked the governor and the local law enforcement agencies for resolving the case. 
Forensic evidence has been analyzed in different FBI labs across the country, and state and local authorities will continue to process evidence, Patel said.
“In less than 36 hours, 33 to be precise, thanks to the full weight of the federal government and leading out with the partners here in the state of Utah and Gov. Cox, the suspect was apprehended in a historic time period,” Patel said.
Earlier on Friday morning, President Donald Trump said a suspect was in custody.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” he said on Fox News.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Three Florida Cabinet members would support revocation by the U.S. Department of State of visas held by legal immigrants who celebrate the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.
Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia and Attorney General James Uthmeier argue admission into the United States is a “privilege” that shouldn’t be extended to immigrants who praise Kirk’s murder, Ingoglia and an Uthmeier aide told The Florida Phoenix. This comes one day after the State Department warned immigrants against mocking or praising 31-year-old Kirk’s death.
“Immigrants get visas, among other reasons, because the U.S. has First Amendment freedoms they don’t have in their own countries. If they’re caught celebrating the assassination of someone expressing free speech, they obviously haven’t learned the lesson,” Ingoglia, who sponsored stringent anti-illegal immigration legislation as a state senator, said in a text message.
“Send them home.”
Uthmeier’s communications director, Jeremy Redfern, said the attorney general’s office would “absolutely” support revoking these individuals’ visas and denying future entry to migrants who praised Kirk’s murder.
“Getting a visa to come into the U.S. is a privilege, not a right,” Redfern said. After this story was published, Agriculture commissioner Wilton Simpson added that he makes “three members” of the Florida cabinet to support visa revocation.
The Department of State directed staff Thursday to “undertake appropriate action” for immigrants who “glorify” Kirk’s death. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau added that these individuals “are not welcome visitors to our country.”
A State Department spokesperson told the Phoenix via email that the Trump administration doesn’t think visas should be granted to “persons whose presence in our country does not align” with national security interests.
It wouldn’t be the first time the Trump administration has authorized visa cancellation, revocation, or withholding from current or prospective U.S. immigrants. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the use of artificial intelligence to identify foreign-born pro-Palestine protesters and revoke their student visas.
The move was aligned with President Donald Trump’s January executive order targeting visa holders who “threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology.” It also aligns with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for the federal government to deport foreign-born students who he said were setting up university encampments to protest Israel.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story. State Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent who formerly served as the Senate’s Minority Leader, told the Phoenix that although an immigration attorney would be more clear on the legalities of mass visa revocation, national security and public safety is cause for removal.
“Anyone here on a visa, celebrating the assassination of an American citizen, should be swiftly revoked and removed,” Pizzo said.
Honors planned
Kirk, co-founder of the conservative Turning Point USA, was shot and killed in Orem, Utah, Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. While highly controversial, Kirk was a massively influential figure on the right who gained popularity by traveling to college campuses to debate students on left-leaning issues.
He’d forged close relationships with President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who canceled his scheduled 9/11 memorial appearance in New York to instead visit Kirk’s wife and two children. Trump has announced that Kirk will posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, has urged Congress to build a statue of Kirk in the Capitol halls.

A State Department spokesperson told the Phoenix via email that the Trump administration doesn’t think visas should be granted to “persons whose presence in our country does not align” with national security interests.
It wouldn’t be the first time the Trump administration has authorized visa cancellation, revocation, or withholding from current or prospective U.S. immigrants. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the use of artificial intelligence to identify foreign-born pro-Palestine protesters and revoke their student visas.
The move was aligned with President Donald Trump’s January executive order targeting visa holders who “threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology.” It also aligns with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for the federal government to deport foreign-born students who he said were setting up university encampments to protest Israel.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story.
Honors planned
Kirk, co-founder of the conservative Turning Point USA, was shot and killed in Orem, Utah, Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. While highly controversial, Kirk was a massively influential figure on the right who gained popularity by traveling to college campuses to debate students on left-leaning issues.
He’d forged close relationships with President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who canceled his scheduled 9/11 memorial appearance in New York to instead visit Kirk’s wife and two children. Trump has announced that Kirk will posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, has urged Congress to build a statue of Kirk in the Capitol halls.

In a news release from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office, the funding from the agency’s Revitalization and Placemaking program would go toward creating housing and commercial space in Detroit and Dowagiac, as well as the creation of a new boutique hotel in Calumet.
A vacant building in Manistique would also be transformed into residential and commercial space using grant funding from the Michigan Community Revitalization Program.
“With these new projects in Detroit, Dowagiac, Calumet, and Manistique, we are growing Michigan’s economy and focusing on the people, places, and projects that make Michigan the best place to live, work, and play,” Whitmer said in a statement. “[These programs] create vibrant places that attract and retain talent, add new housing options, enable business creation and attraction, and provide resources for our Michigan communities.”
In Detroit, a $186,842 grant will be used to redevelop a vacant two story building in the city’s Grand River corridor into two commercial spaces with affordable housing on the second floor. 
In Dowagiac, the Wounded Minnow Building, the largest historic building in the city’s downtown corridor, will be redone to provide 10 apartments, while reconfiguring the commercial space occupied by the Wounded Minnow Saloon. The project is supported by $1.4 million in grant funding. 
Two long vacant buildings in Calumet would be redeveloped into a 17 bed boutique hotel and upscale restaurant, supported by $1.5 million in grant funding. 
In Manistique, a former funeral home would be transformed into five apartments and three commercial storage spaces, intended to help address the city’s housing shortage. The state is providing $995,000 in grant funding for the revitalization project.

COVID cases in Connecticut remained relatively stable from March through early July, before rising in late July and August. Hospitalizations from COVID, which remained low throughout the summer months, also rose in August.
“Anecdotally, I’ve been hearing about more cases, and the data also always lags behind what’s actually happening,” said Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Department of Public Health.
While half as many cases were reported in August 2025 as August 2024, case numbers are, in part, a function of how many people choose to get tested. 
“Not every COVID case is being reported to us. So if somebody goes to an urgent care, or maybe just does a self test, we won’t get that data,” Juthani said.
On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont released a statement encouraging all adults, and children older than 6 months, to get a COVID-19 booster shot.
Wastewater surveillance, which tests for COVID-19 concentration in wastewater, saw an increase in late July and at the end of August, otherwise remaining low through the early summer.
“I don’t really know if [COVID cases are] coming down, or if this is going to be part and parcel of the beginning of an early fall into winter increase,” said Juthani. “I think that remains to be seen.”

(Getty Images)Nevada should stop giving tax breaks to tech companies that build data centers in the state. 
Nevada should instead charge hefty fees and impose robust community benefit conditions on tech companies that build data centers in the state.
Nevada should demand that the cost of electricity needed to run data centers will be paid exclusively by the tech companies on whose behalf the centers are operated. 
Nevada should prohibit the companies and utilities from passing those electricity costs to other customers, especially residential ones.
Retroactively taking away tax breaks the state already granted would land Nevada in legal battles it would presumably lose. 
But Nevada can halt giveaways to, and start demanding more from, companies seeking to build new data centers. All that would take is some tweaks to the state’s demeaning and self-deprecating “economic development” statutes.
Nevada should at least do that.
Corporations are always refining their mastery of categorizing, defining, and generally masquerading reported costs and revenues in ways that benefit them and stick it to everybody else. 
So Nevada would have to fight tooth and nail to protect electricity consumers from getting saddled with skyrocketing power bills as a result of data center electricity demand. 
Nevada should at least try.
Jobs, jobs, and snow jobs
Last year, when Google announced it was spending $400 million to build a second big data center in Nevada, bringing its total data center investments in recent years to north of $2 billion in the state, Gov. Joe Lombardo gushed “This investment further cements our state’s reputation as a new tech capital of the West.”
“Tech capital” sounds like something involving a rather large workforce of highly trained employees whose handsome incomes ripple throughout their communities in soothing waves of broadly shared prosperity.
But apart from the construction phase, the data center industry has, as one operator told the Wall Street Journal, “rightly earned a dismal reputation of creating the lowest number of jobs per square foot” of perhaps any indoor commercial enterprise.
Detailed data center, well, data on employment can be hard to come by. One tracking firm tallies 60 data centers (large and small) in Nevada, and according to an Axios analysis of Census data, last year there were about 3,000 data center workers in the state.
Those 3,000 jobs are the equivalent of less than two-tenths of 1% of the Nevada workforce.
That’s in line with the scale of the data center workforce nationally. Early this year the Census Bureau published a brief on national data center employment estimating the facilities employed a half-million workers in 2023,  about three-tenths of 1% of the nation’s workforce at the time.
The global corporate, financial, and governmental rush to plant gazillion square-foot server farms on seemingly every sizable parcel of currently unoccupied dry land on the planet is (again, except for the short-term construction phase) not much of a job-creator.
Stop groveling
The largest single contributor to U.S. gross domestic product is consumer spending.
Or it was.
Through the first six months of this year, tech company investment to build and equip data centers contributed more to U.S. gross domestic product than consumer spending.
So what are we —  which is to say society, humanity, the world, Nevada, etc. —  getting for all that investment, apart from higher power bills, deepfakes, the elimination of jobs, and the dismantling of career ladders?
“AI is contributing to an incredibly wide range of potential longer-term economic outcomes,” reads a brief published by the Council on Foreign Relations early this month. “The proposed aftermath of broad AI adoption ranges from productivity booms that leave large swaths of the population out of work, to incremental innovation and role augmentation, to the stuff of dark sci-fi movies.”
But wait there’s more. The CFR report notes that Nvidia and the handful of tech giants who buy its chips to stuff into their data centers accounted for more than 80% of the S&P 500’s growth over the first half of 2025. 
So that’s another thing we get for all that tech company investment: a bull market, and perhaps an irrationally exuberant one.
The CFR paper refrains from using the phrase “AI bubble” in reference to a potentially very overvalued stock market. By contrast, The Atlantic, one of oodles of publications that are not shying away from the b-word, notes that if there’s a bubble and it pops, “the silver lining would be that fears of sudden AI-driven job displacement are overblown.”
While everyone waits to see what the brave new world has in store for the people in it, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, along with less godly entities, plan to continue collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on more data centers.
Nevada’s data center presence could quadruple (and it probably will unless the boom goes bust first) and it still wouldn’t be a “tech capital.” Or even a data center capital. Compared to California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Virginia, New York and several other mostly coastal states, Nevada is a U.S. data center bit player. AI is going to play out how AI is going to play out, no matter what Nevada thinks or says or does.
But Nevada could at least show some self respect and not grovel before tech companies along the way.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2211086231-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-09-12 10:58:05.606155

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)President Donald Trump on Thursday approved federal disaster relief funds to aid communities damaged by June 20-21 storms that included multiple tornadoes, large hail and straight-line winds.
The presidential disaster declaration opens up federal aid for 19 counties for public infrastructure and recovery efforts. The declaration does not include a dollar amount. 
When Gov. Kelly Armstrong made the request on July 21, a preliminary damage assessment exceeded $11.4 million. The total federal aid could end up being higher based on the applications of those seeking to recoup damages, according to the governor’s office.
“This much-needed disaster aid will help our state’s communities and utilities recover from one of the most powerful summer storms in recent history,” Armstrong said in a statement late Thursday. 
Counties eligible for assistance under the presidential declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells counties.
The approval comes 52 days after Armstrong submitted the request. Earlier this week, state officials commented during an Emergency Commission meeting that the state typically receives a response to disaster aid requests within 30 days.  
A separate request for federal disaster relief submitted last week for August storms is still under review. That request covers Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. The storm that included damaging winds, large hail and multiple tornadoes caused an estimated $6 million in damage, mostly to electrical infrastructure.
The state also started a program to help farmers pay for temporary grain storage and repair and replace damaged farm facilities or equipment. For more information on the Grain Storage and Facility Rebuilder Program, visit the program website.

	“We made jokes about it at the time like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be interesting if all the seismologists in the country were killed in the catastrophic landslide?” said Mike West, Alaska’s state seismologist and director of the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
In September, just five months later, at the aptly named Surprise Inlet, the slope failed, and a succession of five landslides dumped debris into the water, triggering a localized tsunami exactly where the seismologists had paused during their field trip.

	And a month ago, at a scenic fjord elsewhere in Alaska, a mountainside collapsed into a fjord called Tracy Arm about 80 miles southeast of Juneau. The Aug. 10 event generated a tsunami that ran at least 1,500 feet up the wall on the other side of the fjord. It was the biggest Alaska landslide since 2015, when the collapse of a mountainside in a remote part of Wrangell St. Elias National Park caused one of the biggest slides in North American history and generated a 630-foot-high tsunami at a site called Taan Fjord.
Such landslide-triggered tsunamis can be deadly. In 2017, four people were killed by one in Greenland.
In the recent Alaska tsunamis, the most serious loss was a kayak and other gear that was swept out to sea at Tracy Arm. The affected campers, on an island about 4 miles away from the landslide, reported a 100-foot wave that morning but were otherwise unharmed.

	Alaska’s luck may not last, warn scientists with the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
The center has gathered several Alaska experts into a program called the Tsunamigenic SLope Instabilities Partnership, or Arctic T-SLIP, to help address the risks of tsunami-generated landslides amid Alaska’s melting glaciers and thawing permafrost,
“Hazards from landslides and landslide-generated tsunamis are increasing. Among all the natural hazards in Alaska, this hazard is the least quantified and integrated into local, state, and federal hazard management practices,” the Arctic T-SLIP website says.
Alaska’s daunting challenges
Other glaciated regions of the world, like Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, have rigorous landslide monitoring programs. They face their own threats. In Western Norway, for example, an array of instruments initially set up 20 years ago has been monitoring an unstable slope at a site called Åknes that, if it fails catastrophically, could produce a tsunami that would wipe out nearby communities.

	But in Alaska, where there are thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of glaciers that are unmonitored and have not even been named, and vast distances and remoteness pose daunting challenges. Scientists, agencies and communities have thus winnowed down their monitoring to the highest priority sites.
That leads to Prince William Sound.
The sound is the site of several communities. It is home to busy commercial and sport fisheries, and traversed by vessels ranging from kayaks and other small recreational watercrafts, to huge cargo ships and oil tankers. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of people who arrive by boat, train or vehicle each year.
On the northeast side, the main focus of landslide-monitoring is Barry Arm, a fjord about 30 miles from the closest coastal town of Whittier, where Barry Glacier has been receding.
Landslide-affected slopes around Barry Arm fjord are shown in this annotated 2020 map that uses a photograph taken by Gabriel Wolken, a state geological scientist. The prospect of a sudden collapse and large tsunami prompted scientists to issue an unusual warning. (Map provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)
The mountain slope there has been moving gradually for decades, since at least the 1930s, historic photographs show. In recent years, with drastic loss of Barry Glacier’s slope-supporting ice, the movement increased significantly, and there are already periodic slides. By 2020, there were episodes of movement reaching 2 meters in a 30-day period, and Barry Glacier’s retreat had exposed 600 million cubic yards of terrain, according to NASA, an amount six times the size of the 2015 Taan Fjord landslide.

	Those changes led to a dire warning from scientists that year: A catastrophic collapse of the slope could create a tsunami big enough to send a potentially fatal wave to the town of Whittier, 30 miles to the south and west. The scientists were so alarmed that they penned an open letter about the risks.
“This tsunami could impact areas frequented by tourists, fishing vessels and hunters (potentially hundreds of people at one time,” they wrote. “We believe that it is possible that this landslide-generated tsunami will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years.”

	The tsunami didn’t happen in 2020, but the risk remains. Whittier is home to about 275 people, most of whom live in a single high-rise condo building. But the small permanent population belies the town’s significance. It has a deepwater port that buzzes with activity, especially in the summer. Aside from its vessel traffic, it serves Alaska Railroad trains and a variety of vehicles that arrive through a one-of-a-kind single-land tunnel. Other vehicles depart from the Whittier harbor on Alaska Marine Highway ferries connecting the road system to the rest of the sound. 
The discoveries at Barry Arm mobilized what is now a state-of-the-art, federally funded monitoring program that has made the site one of the most instrumented mountain slopes in Alaska.

	Prior to that, West said, there were just “random university researchers or a good-hearted person at the state survey.”
Partners in the multiagency program include the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its National Weather Service, the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys and UAF and its Alaska Earthquake Center, among others.
Dennis Staley, a USGS scientist and Alaska landslide project leader, ticked off the equipment there.

The sensors can detect landslides as well as earthquakes, allowing the Alaska Earthquake Center to monitor both types of movements. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The “backbone” is a set of tidal gauges installed by the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center, Staley said.
Other equipment includes Alaska Earthquake Center seismic stations, which now serve the dual purposes of detecting earthquakes and detecting landslides. There is a ground-based radar system on the opposite side of the fjord to measure downslope movement. There are weather-tracking devices. There are infrasound devices that capture the sounds of rockfalls and other events. There are remote cameras to capture images over time. And new this year, Staley said, is an array of seismic devices at the top of the landslide area.

	Some of the Barry Arm instrumentation can gather information from wider areas, Staley said. Last year’s Surprise Inlet slides, for example, were captured by equipment set up at adjacent Barry Arm.
To maintain the system, scientists travel to the site at least monthly from May to October for tasks like battery replacement and a few times each winter, Staley said.
But Alaska conditions take a toll. The first seismometer installed in 2020 directly on Barry Arm’s landslide area was wiped out by a snow avalanche the following spring, he said.
Adjusting to risks
After the first year of on-site monitoring, scientists downgraded their predicted worst-case scenario of a complete slope collapse to from 30-foot wave at Whittier to a 7-foot wave hitting about half an hour after the landslide.

	That would still be dangerous, with a possible runup of over 500 meters on the opposite fjord wall and wave heights of over 200 meters in northern part of Barry Arm and over 5 meters in southern Barry Arm. Harriman Fjord, which is connected to Barry Arm, would be hit by a tsunami within 10 to 15 minutes of a big slide, scientists estimate.
Scientists have been providing periodic updates since the Barry Arm project started.
“Our job as federal scientists, government scientists, is to do our best to better understand what the actual hazard is, using the best available science, and then to make sure that we’re communicating about that hazard to the public,” Staley said.
In Whittier, people have adjusted their activities according to the risks they perceive.
A tour company that has trademarked its popular “26 Glacier Cruise” – even using an advertising jingle to do so — has reconfigured its itinerary to bypass the hazard area..

	Phillips Cruises & Tours still brings sightseers to 26 glaciers, but the trip offers a different mix than in past years, said Cody Hanna, the company’s vice president of marine operations. It is not sailing into Barry Arm anymore and, for now, the tour boats are also skipping Surprise Inlet and Surprise Glacier, though the latter has been a big draw for sightseers. Instead, the Phillips boats are taking a little more time on their tours and sailing a little farther out into the sound to a site called College Fjord, where there are multiple other glaciers, including the thinning but advancing Harvard Glacier.
“You can’t predict it, but it’s just grown enough to where it’s just not worth it anymore, so we’re back to Harvard Glacier and College Fjord,” Hanna said of the landslide risk.
Peter Denmark, owner of a kayak tour company, said he has also changed his operations because of landslide risks at Barry Arm. “We are not running any commercial tours up in that area, essentially due to liability concerns,” said Denmark, who also serves on Whittier’s city council and holds the position of vice mayor.
Barry Arm and the other landslide-prone sites around Prince William Sound and elsewhere keep him alert to the dangers, he added. “It is, personally, another hazard just from living in Alaska,” he said.

	Brenda Tolner, who has operated a waterfront shop in Whittier for more than 30 years, is less concerned.
If Barry Arm hasn’t caused a localized tsunami in the past, it probably will not do so now, she figures. “I don’t see it as any big threat,” she said.
She does not worry much about the slides in the nearby mountains because they have been happening for decades, she said. “You’ll hear the crash when they come down,” she said.
Tsunami awareness
In seismically active Alaska, people associate tsunamis with earthquakes. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, which was the second most powerful in the historical record killed 139 people, including 11 in Whittier. Most deaths were from the tsunamis that slammed against coastlines.
The 1964 earthquake has a profound legacy in Alaska. That includes preparations for future earthquake-generated tsunamis; several communities are designated by the NWS as “TsunamiReady,” with detailed safety systems to prepare for earthquake-generated tsunamis.

	There is also a history in Alaska of dangerous landslide-induced tsunamis. In Lituya Bay, an ellipse-shaped fjord cut into the Gulf of Alaska coast, a landslide shaken loose by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 1958 triggered a megatsunami. It sent water 1,720 feet up a mountain slope and killed five people. Thirty-six years later, in 1994, a freak underwater slide in the Southeast Alaska town of Skagway caused a localized tsunami that killed a construction worker at a dock.
The slides and tsunami risk being studied in Prince William Sound are different.
They are caused not by earthquakes but long-term weakening of slopes that are no longer supported by glacier ice. A contributing factor sometimes is the thaw of high-altitude permafrost that binds slabs of rock together. Both changes are linked to long-term climate warming.
As glaciers at the bases of mountains rapidly retreat, they are de-buttressing, said Jillian Nicolazzo,  the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey’s landslide program coordinator.

	“So that the ice that had been holding all that rock in place is not there,” she said. “It’s too steep, so it has to find an equilibrium.”
The thawing high-altitude permafrost that contributes to slope weakness known as rock permafrost. Though lingering snow patches offer hints, it is hard to determine exactly how much of it exists on mountains or where it is located, Nicolazzo said. What is known is that it is sensitive to warming and implicated in landslides elsewhere.
“When that ice does start to melt, the space that it occupied becomes a void, and rock and soil fill that void,” she said.
Rain can be another trigger. Surprise Inlet’s landslides last year got their final push from heavy rainfall that loosened the already unstable slope, research shows.

	For residents, there is a pressing question: Can people be warned to evacuate from a landslide tsunami just as they are with earthquake-generated tsunamis, which can take hours to hit shores?
“Potentially, yes. The difficulty is you have to know that the landslide occurred and where it occurred, to start with,” Nicolazzo said. “We might be talking minutes, but it takes the scientists that long to triangulate where it came from,” Nicolazzo said.
Seismic signals are used to pinpoint locations. Scientists at the Alaska Earthquake Center can spot the differences between landslide seismic signals and earthquake signals. Earthquake signals are more varied in their frequencies and more sudden; landslide signals tend to be in low frequencies and are more gradual.

The signal confirmed that the tsunami was caused by a large landslide. The signal came just minutes before the tsunami was observed. (Image provided by the Alaska Earthquake Center)
 

	The center’s seismic network proved vital in the Tracy Arm event, Nicolazzo said.
“They saw it pretty quickly and they were able to triangulate,” she said. “But the timing does make it difficult. The landslide happens, and then water starts moving.”
Good news, bad news
The downgrading of the severity of a Barry Arm collapse is a piece of good news that has come from the new monitoring. The bad news – as demonstrated by the Surprise Inlet landslides — is that there are numerous other Prince William Sound sites at risk.
A 2024 USGS study used satellite data to identify 43 sites in the sound where landslides occurred between 2016 and 2022. Fourteen were previously known. Eleven of the identified sites have potential for generating tsunamis.

	Rising to the top of that list is Maynard Mountain, said Gabriel Wolken, a geologist who heads the Division of Geophysical and Geological Surveys’ Climate and Cryosphere Hazards Program.
Maynard Mountain, through which the single-land Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel runs, looms directly over Whittier and a new cruise dock that started operations this year. Shrinking Learnard Glacier clings near the top, while rocks frequently tumble off its lower flanks.
Government agencies lack the resources to do a Barry Arm-like instrumentation and monitoring program, Wolken said. But what agency scientists can do is watch the mountain, whether from land or remotely through satellite imagery captured from space.

	“We did that at Barry Arm. We’ve learned a lot from that exercise,” Wolken said.
To better understand Maynard’s contours and landslide potential, the division was planning a survey of the mountain this fall using lidar, a technology that measures distance using light beams. This year’s planned lidar survey follows one performed at Maynard in 2022.
The probability of a tsunami-generating landslide at Maynard is considered to be very low, but the results if one were to happen would be “cataclysmic,” said Bretwood Higman, a Seldovia-based geologist who is part of the Woodwell Climate Research Center team.
“If a landslide failed catastrophically, you’ve got two minutes. There’s nothing you can do in two minutes, basically,” Higman said.

Lessons learned at Barry Arm are also being applied on the other side of the Whittier tunnel, where retreating Portage Glacier is exposing an unstable slope that is already the site of frequent rockslides.
As with Maynard Mountain, lidar surveys are planned at Portage, Wolken said. There are also plans for ice-penetrating radar surveys to better understand the glacier’s thickness and the characteristics of the bedrock below, he said.

Now the glacier has retreated so much that it is around the right corner, requiring a boat ride or mountain hike to see it in summer. A bit of Burns Glacier, which has also retreated dramatically, is visible from the visitor center. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Higman, who spends a lot of time scouting the Portage Glacier area, said two slide areas by the melting glacier are combining to reshape the slope. “The very bottom of the slope is just falling apart and crumbling onto the glacier,” he said.
There is no permanent community at Portage Glacier, but the area is a popular destination for tourists and recreational users. For tourists, Portage Glacier’s retreat is part of the attraction. At the Forest Service’s Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, big windows that once provided close-up views of glacier ice now overlook open water. People wanting to see the namesake glacier must now hike up a mountain pass or boat across the lake or, in winter when the lake is frozen, ski or skate across it.
New device could provide communities with advanced warning 
Higman, who has experimented with a series of measuring devices at different Southcentral Alaska mountain sites, has come up with what he believes could be a valuable tool for community-based landslide safety.
It is a simple, glass-encased device using the type of radar signals that are employed on fishing boats. The devices send radio signals, “like a walkie-talkie,” through the internet to nearby databases. The goal is to detect changes in the slope. Since small movements precede big slides, the devices could give advance warning opportunities.

The devices use a simple radar system to measure slope movements that might precede landslides, and they are able to send signals by internet that can be recorded in a database. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The devices promise to be more practical than other equipment Higman and his partners have positioned on various slopes, he said. They do not need to be embedded into holes dug into bedrock, as is necessary with some movement-measuring equipment. They are relatively cheap and easy to retrieve and replace, if needed. They could be managed by members of the public in affected communities. And they might avoid the problems with equipment he has installed at Columbia Glacier, a Prince William Sound landmark, where mountain goats have gnawed on or possibly eaten expensive communications and GPS devices.
Higman said he has nearly a dozen of the devices, and he has deployed them in a few places, mostly at Portage and at a Matanuska River Valley site called Glacier View, where a slide threatens a small subdivision.
It’s only a start, he said.
“I’m aiming for 100 sites. That’s what we need,” he said.

Beyond the sound
On the long list of landslide-prone glaciated areas is the coastal town of Seward, a popular tourist and recreation destination just outside of Prince William Sound on the Kenai Peninsula.
The town of 2,800 has recent experience with landslide-generated tsunamis.

	Last year, a section of mountain face fell into a marine site called Pedersen Lagoon, triggering a local tsunami that reached a height of about 56 feet. The Aug. 7, 2024, event did not injure anyone, but it damaged a private lodge’s wooden boardwalks and affected a Kenai Fjords National Park camping area. Previously, a 2022 landslide in Seward caused a small tsunami that was detected by equipment aboard the UAF-operated research vessel Sikuliaq.
Wolken, who loves to visit the picturesque coastal town with his family, laughed when asked if the precarious conditions of the slopes there dampens his enjoyment.
Family trips now to Seward are punctuated with safety lectures delivered to his two young daughters, and his watchfulness is constant, he said.
“I’m always looking at the slopes. I know the destruction that’s possible from gravity,” he said. “I don’t zone out. I’m always scanning.”

Just how many hazardous sites are out there? Bretwood “Hig” Higman, a geologist based in the Kenai Peninsula town of Seldovia, has done a basic inventory.
From 2012 to early this year, there have been more than 1,000 slow-moving slides of different varieties, with triggers that include receding glaciers, thawing permafrost, extreme weather or combinations of those factors, according to his calculations.
 

A Ketchikan landslide covers the Tongass Highway at a spot called Wolfe Point on March 20, 2025. The slide closed that part of the highway for days after, but there were no injuries that resulted from it. (Photo provided by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities)
 

	In a state where people contend with earthquakes, floods, wildfires and erupting volcanoes, it may be difficult to add another type of natural disaster to the public’s list of worries, Higman said. But elevating landslide awareness and preparedness is necessary as events increase, he said.
“It is vastly more risky than most things we deal with,” said Higman, a partner in an Alaska landslide science program created by the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Shallow, sudden slides triggered by rain
The lesson has been learned in Southeast Alaska, where catastrophic slope failures triggered by extreme rains have proved deadly. Since 2015, 12 people have been killed by landslides in Sitka, Haines, Wrangell and Ketchikan. Victims included an entire family of five killed by a sudden slide in Wrangell in late 2023.
In Southeast Alaska, steep mountains that were created through tectonic processes rise from the water’s edge, and rain is frequent. It is naturally susceptible to landslides.

	“One of the primary processes that sculps the landscape in southeast Alaska is landslides and glaciers and rivers,” said Dennis Staley, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist and Alaska landslide program leader. “When you combine rapid uplift with steep slopes with junky rock and lots of rainfall, you have all of the key ingredients for landslides.”
Southeast Alaska landslides are classified as shallow slides because they involve the soil, trees and other materials atop the bedrock rather than the rock itself. Those slides are numerous; the USGS recorded 162 news-reported slides in Southeast Alaska from 1990 to 2024. They are longstanding threats. A 1936 landslide in Juneau, for example, killed 15 people.
Now climate change is compounding the threat by creating more extreme rainfall events, driven by atmospheric rivers, as well as bringing more winter rain that, in other years, would be snowfall.
That means efforts to monitor landslide risks extend not just to topography studies but also the details about precipitation. Whether it is rain or snow – or rain-on-snow – has implications for slope stability, and the multiagency team studying landslide risks in Southeast Alaska has developed a prototype monitoring station to record precise qualities of the precipitation, as well as wind and temperature.

	Beyond federal and state agencies’ work and that of university organizations like the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, there is focused work by tribal governments and community organizations.
The Sitka Sound Science Center, previously known for its fisheries and ocean science work, now has one of the most well-developed landslide programs. The center’s landslide program was launched in 2015, after a slide there killed three. The center now maintains a local landslide hazards dashboard, and it participates in and coordinates a variety of research projects and educational programs.
One is the Kutí project, a partnership with the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska and other tribal partners. Named for the Lingit word meaning “weather,” the program is funded by a National Science Foundation grant awarded in 2022. The purpose is development of a more regional Southeast Alaska monitoring, warning and educational system.
The Sitka center’s work has been hampered by Trump administration budget cuts and policies. A landslide conference that the center was set to host last spring was canceled because Trump administration policies prevented federal partners from attending.
Permafrost thaw and frozen lobes

	Farther north, slopes are shifting and creeping as permafrost thaws, creating hazards for infrastructure. The best-known case may be in Interior Alaska at Denali National Park and Preserve, where one of the more than 140 detected landslides along the park’s sole road interfered with travel.
That slide, at a site called Pretty Rocks at the midpoint of the 92-mile road, had been ongoing for years, creating maintenance headaches for park staffers trying to keep the road open. In 2021, it finally made the road impassable there.
A project is underway to create a bridge over the slide area, but it is proving more complicated than originally envisioned. Early on, it was estimated to cost a bit under $100 million and expected to be completed by the 2025 tourist season. Since then, the completion date has been pushed back, with full road access expected to resume in 2027. The cost is now estimated at $150 million, a figure that does not include potential work at other landslide sites along the park’s road.
More than infrastructure at risk from Interior landslides. Last summer, when a guided rafting expedition encountered a landslide on the Nenana River just outside the park, a woman in the party was killed.
 

A frozen debris lobe in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is seen in 2020. This lobe of frozen material was stable and nearly completely vegetated until about 2005, when it began to thaw and move downslope. (Photo provided by the National Park Service)
 

	Yet farther north, masses of frozen material are working their way down to the corridor that holds the trans-Alaska pipeline. University of Alaska Fairbanks and state scientists have identified more than 200 of them in the Brooks Range. As of last year, said UAF’s Margaret Darrow, there were 99 identified along the Dalton Highway, the road that parallels the trans-Alaska pipeline and the sole land route to the Prudhoe Bay oil complex.
The conglomeration of moving ice, water, crumbling rock and vegetation have their own descriptive name: “frozen debris lobes.” Darrow, the principal investigator on various UAF projects, began studying them in 2011, when she drove up the Dalton Highway for a two-family camping trip with a colleague.
The lobes, which move more quickly than thawing permafrost but are not causing sudden collapse, proved enough of a threat to the highway that the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities rerouted a section in 2018, part of a $25 million project that addressed thaw problems along the highway.
The reconfiguration proved necessary. The leftover section of highway was left in place as a test site, and the frozen debris lobe continued to flow. By late 2023, it had shoved the leftover highway section about a foot to the side, according to research led by Darrow.

	In the Arctic, in Alaska and elsewhere, permafrost thaw caused by warming temperatures has triggered widespread landslides known as retrogressive thaw slumps.
Among the affected sites is the Noatak Valley in mountainous Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, considered a hotpot for such slides. In that remote region, the safety of people and property is not much of an issue, but water quality can be. Numerous retrogressive thaw slumps have dumped tens of thousands of cubic meters of sediment into a single creek, according to the National Park Service.
Keeping abreast of the hazards from all types of unstable slopes in Alaska requires coordination by agencies at all levels of government, universities and other entities, said Jillian Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the state’s landslide hazards program.
“At the moment, we can’t do it all,” said Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the landslide program at the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. “Everyone pitches in a little bit, because it is just too much for any one agency.”

Addressing federal uncertainty
The state program gets funding from the USGS, and a big boost for U.S. landslide monitoring has been provided by the National Landslide Preparedness Act signed into law in 2021. Through that act, Congress in 2021 appropriated $4 million specifically to landslide hazards in Prince William Sound.
But the law, which authorized federal funding for landslide programs, expired in 2024.
Legislation is pending in Congress to reauthorize it, with sponsors from Alaska and Washington, states with deadly slides in recent years. One bill is sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington. Another is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington.
Without reauthorization, prospects for future funding are clouded.
The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year would cut funding for USGS natural hazards work – which includes landslide hazards – by about a quarter, from $203 million to $157 million, according to a Congressional Research Service report.
As with the canceled Sitka conference, Trump administration policy interrupted landslide work last spring in Prince William Sound. Massive federal layoff and spending freezes prevented some planned maintenance work at the Barry Arm landslide site.
If federal support for Alaska landslide monitoring becomes spotty, there is a potential backstop: citizen science.

	The Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys earlier this year launched an online app through which members of the public can report the landslide risks they encounter. Those could be actual slides, small rockfalls, cracks or anything unusual, and the division encourages people to submit photographs.
The hope is that important information will be gathered “if people are out hunting and fishing and recreating, especially if they see a lot of landslides that we don’t,” Nicolazzo said.
Without help from the public, scientists like her have to rely a lot on things like satellite imagery, she said. “I mostly sit at a computer and look at Google Earth. The images can be years old,” she said.
So far, the Alaska Landslide Reporter app has not been promoted or used much. But Nidolazzo is hopeful about its eventual utility.
Public awareness is, for now, the prime solution to the landslide problem in a place as big, mountainous, wild and fast-changing as Alaska, Nicolazzo said.
“I think educating people about the risk is the best we can do at this point. Because the area is so large and people are everywhere,” she said.

Years ago, I chose a defining fork in the road and applied to graduate school. As I anxiously awaited acceptance in the  University of Missouri-Columbia’s  School of Journalism, it was my good fortune to snag a summer job at the State Historical Society of Iowa in Iowa City.
As a northwestern Iowa native, living and working in clear view of the beautiful Old Capitol landmark broadened my sense of state history. Just think, in 1857 our fledging Legislature had the foresight to prioritize the creation of the State Historical Society of Iowa! As someone who loved both history and genealogy, the library at 402 Iowa Ave. was a treasure trove.
Today I live much closer to the State Historical Society of Iowa built in 1987 in Des Moines, and I was dismayed to learn in June of staffing cuts at both locations and the abrupt decision to shutter the Iowa City branch by 2026.
I should have seen it coming. Remember in 2023 when Gov. Kim Reynolds rammed through a reorganization of state government, reducing 37 cabinet level-agencies to 16? The State Historical Society of Iowa lost its autonomy, and was placed beneath the Department of Administrative Services, which received one-half of its requested funding this year. The Research Library requires only a miniscule portion of the budget, yet it was deemed a financial drain and “duplicative.”
Plans are underway to move 40% of the research library’s collection to Des Moines this month, but due to space constraints, a new home is being sought for the remainder.
The “Annals of Iowa,” an academic journal edited and published by the state for 163 years, also now is looking for a new home. Although it basically was self-supporting, the decision was justified as a staffing issue.
A Change.org Petition to Save Iowa History 2025 has garnered 7,008+ signatures to date.
Required whitewashing?
This history-making-headlines moment in Iowa is a bellwether for the current upheaval of our national history. In observance of our country’s 250th anniversary this year, the Trump administration wants the Smithsonian to “celebrate American exceptionalism” by “removing divisive or partisan narratives and restoring confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”
The Smithsonian Institute’s Board of Regents is being required to conduct an internal, comprehensive review of its exhibits and materials and “implement content corrections where necessary.”
The initiative takes aim at eight of the Smithsonian’s 21 museums. Additional museums will be included in a second phase.
Most troublesome is the Trump directive to remove “improper ideology.” Who will be the arbiter of “proper” ideology? Does this mean our history will be whitewashed?
In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated National Endowment for the Humanities grants to thousands of groups across the country including humanities councils, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, educators, and media outlets.
Fortunately, a federal judge has ruled that this abrupt elimination of grants previously approved by Congress was “unlawful” and that a lawsuit by humanities groups can move forward.
However, humanities councils still are operating without their congressionally appropriated funds, and many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs.
In April, the beloved National History Day competition for high school students was jeopardized by these DOGE cuts. A social media funding campaign allowed the national competition in May to go forward. But the future of National History Day remains uncertain. Its 2026 theme is very timely: “Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.”
Gaining a foothold in classrooms
Yet against this backdrop of iconic historical resources under siege, a new history exhibit, The Founders Museum, opened inside the Eisenhower Executive Building next door to the White House. It’s a partnership between the White House Task Force 250, the U.S. Dept. of Education, and PragerU.
Ever heard of PragerU? Me, neither. It’s not a university, any more than the University of Okoboji is. It’s a conservative nonprofit founded by conservative radio host Dennis Prager and an associate in 2009, and funded by very wealthy donors. Its business model is 5-minute edutainment videos covering an array of topics. It also has its own PragerU YouTube Channel.
You may recall the “America First” test adopted by Oklahoma to screen New York and California teacher applicants on their wokeness quotient? PragerU created the test.
The Founders Museum features 56 portraits of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, along with 40 AI-generated, animated short videos of these historical individuals telling stories — produced by PragerU. The intent is for these individuals, places, and events to come to life, making history engaging to Americans. No doubt it’s a worthy goal.
However, did President John Adams ever say, “Facts don’t care about your feelings?” Probably not, but his AI character does. Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative commentator, has used it often, and it’s even become a meme.
Most of us aren’t experts in multiple fields, and therefore we don’t know all the facts. The facts we’re using as our filters and how we source them are critical components.
PragerU maintains that the Signers’ narratives are based on letters, speeches, and original writing. However, the issue goes beyond whether the animated stories are based on historical archives; PragerU’s carefully curated narratives raise the issue of which individuals integral to our history are being left out: People of color? Working class Americans? Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant to the U.S., didn’t sign the Declaration of Independence because he was with the Continental Army in New York at the time.
Another section, titled Ladies of the Revolution, raises my hackles; why not call it: Women of the Revolution? All ladies are women, but does this imply not all women are ladies? Mercy Otis Warren, a woman well ahead of her time, stridently criticized leaders at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention through her writings. She spoke truth to power. But her words seem watered down in her AI story.

Another section will feature 20 “Major Events,” but it appears incomplete.
The Founders Museum isn’t only available to tourists in Washington D.C. There are plans to take it on the road with mobile museum trucks during this Sesquicentennial year. Schools and state capitols will be encouraged to incorporate The Founders Museum in some way. (Oklahoma and Florida already have approved PragerU’s separate history initiative in their classrooms.)
History: What is it good for?
Why do we need history? Why do the archival resources that form the foundation of history matter?
Plainspoken former President Harry S. Truman once said, “The only thing new in the world is the history you don’t know.”
In fact, history offers lessons with uncanny applications to current events. For instance:
(1) At a Sept. 4 with Health and Human Services Secretary RFK, Jr. ,Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, presented a chart showing the positive impact of vaccine use in reducing and eliminating infectious diseases in the past century. She pointed out, “You’re basically trying to refute over 100 years of history on vaccines.”
(2) Why was the Insurrection Act passed in 1807 and why are we hearing about it today? How about the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878? The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy military or federalize the National Guard against Americans in certain cases of emergency or rebellion. The primary exception to it is the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the military from civilian law enforcement.
(3) Why did fluoridization of drinking water became widespread in the U.S. by 1960? It’s been hailed as one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century for its success in preventing tooth decay in children and tooth loss in adults, especially those in low-income families with limited access to dental care. Why is RFK, Jr. targeting it, with Utah and Florida following his lead to ban it, and other states proposing legislation?
(4) Why is the Civil Rights struggle such an integral part of our history? Florida’s revised K-12 curriculum teaches that some Black people benefited from slavery because it helped them develop useful skills. Could this partially illustrate why considerations of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion still are relevant after 250 years of U.S. history?
(5) Why should the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Labor Statistics remain independent? As Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, pointed out at confirmation hearing of Stephen Miran, this isn’t a theoretical argument. “We’ve actually seen this happen before when other countries with authoritarians take control of the central bank, working people suffer from higher inflation,” she said.
When Richard Nixon tried to paint a rosier picture of inflation and unemployment data, he wanted to purge Jewish members of the BLS because of unfounded bias. “There’s a Jewish cabal, you know, running through this…. ” he said. “But there’s the BLS staff. Now how the hell do you ever expect us to get anything from that staff, the raw data, let alone what the poor guys have to say [inaudible] that isn’t gonna be loaded against us? You understand?”
Is history history – will it become a victim of identity politics? History is not only the stuff between the covers of dry, dusty books. And history certainly isn’t the faux history bought and paid for by ideologues living in the lap of luxury. History is a living and breathing entity that humanizes us, binds us together as a nation, and impacts our daily lives. That’s something to celebrate in our 250th year!
If our leaders respect our history, and we the people scrutinize it, we can save ourselves from our worst human instincts. History doesn’t belong to one group of Americans, or one political party, or presidential administration. It belongs to us all. Indeed, history has its eyes on us.










Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive.

Sinclair Inc., the parent company for Rhode Island’s WJAR, is taking over the infrastructure and operations for one of its rival market stations, ABC6 (WLNE), Jessica Bellucci, company spokesperson confirmed to Rhode Island Current on Friday morning.
The local market share agreement between Sinclair and ABC6’s parent company, Standard Media Group, lets Sinclair take over the equipment, operations and infrastructure for the second broadcast station, without changing the license ownership. The transaction closed Friday morning, Bellucci said.
“Sinclair is committed to producing distinctive content that delivers value and strengthens the connection to the local communities we serve,” Bellucci said in an email. “WJAR and WLNE represent the best of local broadcasting in the region, and we look forward to building on that legacy to continue to serve viewers across Southern New England.”
Bellucci declined to answer additional questions. 
However, beloved local  TV meteorologist Kelly Bates posted on social media Thursday that she and other ABC6 workers had lost their jobs due to the new agreement.
“It happened again,” Bates said in a Facebook video. “Our station was just bought by the station that I worked for previously and that parent company has decided I am a redundancy and needed to go.”
Bates spent most of her two-decade career at WJAR. She left the station in September 2021 amid a contract dispute, sparking outrage from Bates’ supporters, according to news reports. She returned to airwaves less than one year later, scooped up ABC6.
Standard Media Group  did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday. The company still listed ABC6 as one of its local stations on its website. 
The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training has not received any notices for layoffs at ABC6, Samuel Aboh, an agency spokesperson, confirmed Friday. Under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, companies are required to let state and local officials know in advance about mass layoffs or facility closures.
A non-license agreement lets the two stations bypass longstanding federal regulatory restrictions which seek to prevent monopolies in local broadcast markets. However, a single company owning two local stations, including licenses, might not be out of the question, either.
In July 2025, a federal appeals court threw out part of the Federal Communications Commission’s longstanding regulations that restricted ownership in a local broadcast market to no more than one station. Meanwhile, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, continues to push for further deregulation of broadcast regulation and ownership limits.

Gretchen Whitmer said the nation’s recent lagging jobs report and the uncertain nature of federal tariffs will be in focus during a speech planned next week.
The Democrat’s announcement also hinted that she’ll address Michigan’s stalled budget negotiations in what would be her first major public statement on the Legislature’s failure to put a spending plan in place. The current fiscal year ends Sept. 30, and the state government is facing an Oct. 1 shutdown.
Whitmer announced in a news release Wednesday that she will deliver an address to the state Tuesday. Her office said the governor would also touch on new troubling signs in America’s manufacturing sector.
All of that potentially bodes unwell for Michigan’s economy, and signals additional trouble for the nation’s economic status.
“Federal tariffs are driving economic uncertainly, leading to massive job loss, instability in our nation’s manufacturing sector, and concerning signs for our economic future,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Elected leaders need to set aside politics, do our jobs to protect and defend our constituents, and work together so we can create a bright future for every American. In Michigan, that includes passing a balanced, bipartisan budget that lowers costs, invests in education, healthcare, public safety, and roads. I look forward to laying out the stakes on Tuesday.”
Whitmer cited the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics current employment statistics preliminary national benchmark summary, and a report from the independent, bipartisan Center for American Progress. The latter asserts that President Donald Trump’s tariff trade war was squeezing middle-class manufacturing employment.
Whitmer’s speech will be delivered from the state capital in Lansing, but a time and location has not been announced.

After a summer characterized by masked federal agents detaining immigrants in Los Angeles, the California Legislature passed two measures Thursday that seek to force law enforcement officers to identify themselves.
Senate Bills 627 and 805 were among the most controversial to pass in the final days of this year’s legislative session. They would ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, as well as require officers to be readily identifiable, respectively. 

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and lead author of SB 627: “As we go through this horrific era of mass deportation and a Supreme Court that allows this authoritarian regime to do whatever the heck it wants to do — including straight-up racial profiling of Latino people — California should lead and put a stop to the secret police.”

The measures passed along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. Police unions also oppose the proposed mask ban.

GOP Sen. Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, in a statement: “This is a reckless anti-law enforcement proposal that puts law enforcement officers and their families at real risk, undermining the safety of the men and women who bravely protect our communities.”

Though today should be the last day of session, lawmakers are expected to extend their work through Saturday to give final votes to some last-minute deals they struck this week. Those that pass will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for his signature or veto, and those that don’t are dead for the year.
Other proposals awaiting Newsom’s decision, include: 

Regulate companion bots: SB 243 would put tighter regulations on online chatbots powered by artificial intelligence to limit their risks on young users.


Higher car dealer fees: SB 791 would raise the cap car dealers can charge to process documents from $85 to $260.


Wage boost for incarcerated firefighters: AB 247 would increase the minimum wage for incarcerated firefighters fighting active wildfires to $7.25 an hour.


Abortion pill protections: AB 260 would help protect California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients, and remove the names of patients and providers from abortion medication prescriptions.


Kill mute swans: AB 764 would make it easier for hunters and landowners to kill the invasive species.


Ban plastic glitter: AB 823 would enforce a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.


Save the bees: AB 1042 would create a health program for managed honey bees that would provide grants to beekeepers, farmers and others for projects and research supporting the struggling population.

Google pulls the strings behind the scenes

As one of the top spenders in California lobbying last year, Google has poured millions of dollars to influence the state government. But its involvement in some proposals isn’t always clear-cut, underscoring the stealthy ways the tech giant goes about trying to shape policies, report CalMatters’ Khari Johnson and Yue Stella Yu.
It quietly orchestrated a campaign to water down a proposed California regulation, and it was so stealthy that lawmakers didn’t see the company’s fingerprints until CalMatters informed them.
In April the company began reaching out to small businesses using email lists, urging them to sign a petition opposing a measure that would require browsers to give users a way to automatically tell websites not to share their personal information with third parties. 
This outreach campaign, however, did not look like it came directly from Google, but rather the “Connected Commerce Council,” which Google backs financially. Google itself also never took a public position on the measure.
Though Google’s tactics aren’t illegal, it raises concern among some advocates who are critical of big tech’s influence.

Brandon Forester, an organizer for the nonprofit MediaJustice: “None of us wants to enter a surveillance marketplace every time that we go on the internet. Part of the reason they need to do the shadow lobbying is because the things that they want to do to achieve their infinite growth model is not good for the public.”

Less food, more solar

In stretches of the San Joaquin Valley that rarely get enough water to grow food, farmers and ranchers faced with barren, parched land have the opportunity to generate a new crop: solar energy. But a bill that aims to incentivize more farmers to install solar panels has farmers split, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Under a 60-year-old law known as the Williamson Act, farmers can enter into contracts with local governments that allow them to pay less on their property tax as long as they use their land for farming. To cancel the contract before the end of its term results in steep penalty fees.
But AB 1156, if passed, would enable farmers to suspend contracts and avoid fees if they use their land to capture solar energy, although their property tax would still increase. The bill would help the state reach its clean energy goals since generating solar power requires hundreds of thousands of acres.
Though some farmers welcome an alternative use for their dried-out land, others argue that the bill undermines farming regions and chips away at the adjacent economies that help the agriculture industry operate.

Stephen Routh
Stephen Routh is a political science professor at California State University Stanislaus


California is starting to reach blue-flame-level political heat over two constitutional questions around mask wearing. 
Can local governments ban masks during public protests, as one Central Valley city did six years ago? The Modesto ordinance returned to the spotlight in June after several people protesting the immigration raids were arrested, prompting challenges from the ACLU and the NAACP. 
And should California prevent law enforcement officers from wearing masks while performing their duties? Lawmakers this week passed the No Secret Police Act, stemming from outrage over masked federal officers detaining individuals they believe are immigrants.
Ultimately resolving these questions involves balancing people’s right to safety with their right to express their views publicly. It’s a puzzle that’s more complex than it looks.
When a local government such as Modesto bans masks, at first glance it appears to be an understandable and legitimate policy to protect the public in large gatherings. It’s aimed at preventing or minimizing violent behavior by those who’d be emboldened to engage in it if their identity is cloaked. 
On the other hand, not allowing protesters to be anonymous harms their ability to protect themselves against retaliation from opponents, including government officials. Also, mask bans sweep in people wearing masks for medical or religious reasons.
In this light, mask prohibitions can be seen as unconstitutional intrusions on the rights of free speech and political association.
The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” But it doesn’t mention freedom of association. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided freedom of association is implied from the explicitly stated rights of speech, press, assembly and petition, which together are called freedom of expression. 
The Constitution protects free expression — except if it incites lawless actions, is obscene, defames, defrauds or is part of a criminal conspiracy.
Any government that restricts protected expression must ensure the regulation is content-neutral, meaning it can’t vary based on its content or impact. The critical question about local mask bans is are they content-neutral or content-based? 
A complete ban on masks at demonstrations would seem, on its face, to indicate content neutrality if no single group or expression is being directly favored or disfavored. The Supreme Court would likely uphold it as constitutional.
What happens when government agents apply the law in a way that impacts certain groups of people differently, affecting who gets arrested for violating the ban and who feels chilled or hesitant about participating in a protest? Those with views that run contrary to the influential private actors or governmental officials are likely to mask up out of fear of retribution.  
What about protestors who, for medical reasons or religious beliefs, need to cover their faces? If a mask ban carves out exemptions for them, how would government officials ascertain who these people are in a public protest? 
Such selective or capricious enforcement of an otherwise constitutional law can render it illegitimate in the eyes of the Supreme Court, which may conclude that the mask ban contains content-based elements and is unconstitutional. 
Different constitutional concerns are at play with the ban on law enforcement masks the state Legislature approved. The ban would affect local police and federal officers, including ICE, Border Patrol and Homeland Security. 
It’s difficult to imagine the Supreme Court — whether it has a liberal or a conservative majority — allowing a state to micromanage or second guess federal law enforcement operations by not allowing government agents to mask up, especially while enforcing  immigration law, which the Constitution places under federal purview.
Since the earliest days of our republic, the Supreme Court has consistently reined in state efforts to constrain federal government endeavors. The court is acting on federalism principles in the Constitution: Federal law generally preempts state law or policy. 
The only plausible avenue California has to push back against federal face covering would be if Congress enacts such a law and the president signs it. That’s highly unlikely. The Trump administration says officers in ICE raids would face threats and doxxing if they weren’t masked.
Few constitutional issues arise if the potential anti-masking law is applied only to local police. The concern is more about policy and practice. Holding local officers accountable for their actions must be balanced against giving police discretion to make tactical and operational decisions.  
Distilled, mask bans create legal and societal issues that are tough to resolve at any time — but even more so now, as partisan battles brew daily amid aggressive exertions of federal and presidential power.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825_Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA_TS_CM_32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936

Following an exceptionally dry summer, all of Utah is currently in drought — most of the state is in “severe” drought, while some desert regions are rated as “extreme.” A number of the state’s reservoirs are below 50% capacity with just two, Current Creek and Strawberry, above 85%. Great Salt Lake levels are veering back into dangerously low levels, while statewide precipitation data puts 2025 at far below the 10-year average.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has already issued a state of emergency related to the drought. Now, the federal government is announcing emergency loans, covering nine counties in Utah — Box Elder, Cache, Duchesne, Rich, Salt Lake, Summit, Utah, Wasatch and Weber — and three in Idaho — Bear Lake, Franklin and Oneida.
Now, small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, nurseries and private nonprofits (which include faith-based organizations) experiencing financial losses related to the drought can apply for assistance through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, administered by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. 
The SBA said in a news release that losses don’t have to be physical — the loans can be used to pay debts, payroll, accounts payable and other costs incurred due to the drought. 
“Through a declaration by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, SBA provides critical financial assistance to help communities recover,” Chris Stallings, associate administrator of the Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience at the SBA, said in a statement. “We’re pleased to offer loans to small businesses and private nonprofits impacted by these disasters.”

The loans can cover up to $2 million, with interest rates as low as 4% for small businesses, and 3.6% for private nonprofits, with terms up to 30 years. The interest does not accrue, and payments are not due until 12 months after they are distributed.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) will request a $5.6 billion budget for fiscal year 2027 to support programs like the Alabama Reading Initiative (ARI), English language learners (ELL) and speech pathologists.
The department plans to request $52 million to help coach struggling readers beyond third grade.  The department previously asked for the same amount and was granted $12 in supplemental funds.
The department originally requested $25 million for the program for fiscal year 2027, which starts on Oct. 1, 2026.
Alabama House passes $10 billion education budget

Tonya Chestnut, who represents District 5 on the board, said the department should ask for more.
“If we decrease it, are we really saying this is a priority or are we saying that we are trying to appeal to what we think the legislators want?” Chestnut asked during the meeting.
Chestnut proposed raising the request back to $52 million, based on a calculation from “if every struggling reader in every school got the same services” according to Alabama Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey.
“I feel that every child, regardless of where they’re located, should, if they need the support, have it available,” she said.
District 4 Representative Yvette Richardson said asking for more money would help address students who are in the gap due to Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP) testing.
“Because we started with $52 [million] at least ask for $52 [million] whether we get it or not because there may be some [students] that fell in between when we ended up giving the ACAP,” she said to Mackey.
The board decided to ask for the full $52 million and said they will negotiate with legislators to secure the funding.
ALSDE is also requesting additional funding for the High Needs Special Education Program for fiscal year 2027. The department is requesting an additional $3.4 million to be back to their original budget for the program.
The reason money for the program decreased for fiscal year 2026 is because it was reallocated.
“In the budget process, the legislature moved $3.4 million out of this line item to the new RAISE Act Special Education fund,” Mackey said to the board. “Districts are still getting it, but they’re getting it through the RAISE Act Special Education fund.”
The program, which was started by the board, uses the funds to ensure that students who need special assistance such as nurses or to be placed in a different school, have the resources they need.
The department will also request an additional $50.4 million for school safety. 
Mackey said the money will be used by the schools to get approved items outlined in the School Security Act including cameras, fencing, ballistic film to place on windows, weapons and metal detectors.
Another big ticket item that ALSDE proposed more funding for is assessments.
“We always ask for more money in student assessment because we’re always in the hole in student assessment,” Mackey said. “It’s a very expensive endeavor to do assessments and some of our most expensive assessments per child are not the ones we talk the most about.”
The board is proposing an $8.3 million increase in student assessments to bring their budget up to $28.8 million.
The board would use the additional money to improve the quality assurance of ACAP and virtual platforms for homeschooled students to test at home with their own devices.
ALSDE also wants to focus on expanding the career technical initiative. The board is requesting an additional $15 million be added to the budget for CTSO membership, grants, the expansion of career exploration to elementary and middle schools and expanding the Academy of Craft Training in Birmingham.
The board will vote on the budget on Oct. 9.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9616-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936
,California,2025-09-12 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Two years later, Californians still don’t know full impact of the $20 fast food wage",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/fast-food-minimum-wage-california/,"Fast food prices barely went up but jobs held steady after the wage increase, researchers in a union-friendly economic center wrote. But an industry-backed study said 19,000 jobs were lost.","As the California Legislature churns toward the end of its 2025 session this week, processing the remnants of thousands of bills introduced during the year, several measures encompass the Capitol’s most enduring conflict: Labor unions vs. employers over working conditions.
Unions seek higher wages and benefits, citing the welfare and financial needs of workers and their families. Employers counter that the cost of providing what unions want adversely affects their competitiveness in other states and nations and forces them to raise prices, reduce employment or even leave California to remain solvent.
In the main, unions fare better than employers in California’s political arena — not surprising given that union-friendly Democrats from the governor down dominate the Capitol.
One of the most intense union-employer battles arose in 2022 over legislation that would have raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $22 an hour. It also declared that fast food franchises are merely subsidiaries of their parent chains, rather than independently owned businesses.
Fast food companies and franchisees saw it as a double whammy that not only would increase their costs but it would undermine the franchise system itself. The industry also disliked the bill’s creation of an appointed council with the power to regulate fast food working conditions, especially wages.
The measure passed both legislative houses with party-line votes, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it. The industry responded with a campaign to put the issue on the ballot, pledging that affected corporations would spend any amount of money to overturn the law due to its effects on the franchise system.
Which faction would win such a battle will never be known, however, because a year after the bill was signed and after lengthy negotiations, a compromise was worked out and quickly enacted. It raised the minimum wage to an initial $20 an hour and left the oversight council intact, albeit with some changes. More importantly to the industry, it did not interfere with the franchise system.
The new wage went into effect in April 2024, and since then the industry and the unions have sparred over its impact not only on wages but on overall employment and fast food prices.
The factions are marking the second anniversary of the 2023 compromise by issuing reports that could not be more different.
Labor acted first with the September 5 release of an analysis by UC-Berkeley’s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. It’s a research organization whose reports uniformly support the union side of issues.
Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy declared that the $20 wage did not reduce fast food employment, didn’t change the number of hours worked and “only led to minimal menu price increases (about 8 cents on a $4 burger).” They said their study included price data from more than 2,000 restaurants in California and other states.
Five days later the Virginia-based Employment Policies Institute — which was created by Berman and Company, a lobbyist for restaurant, hotel beverage, tobacco and fossil fuel interests —  issued its study based on data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
It concluded that California’s fast food industry has lost 19,102 jobs since Newsom signed the law in September 2023, including 15,988 since the law went into effect last year, more than double the rate of loss seen in fast food outlets nationally. It did not delve into fast food prices.
The two competing studies from less-than-objective sources leave us still wondering what the true impact might have been. It’s a knowledge gap that should be filled by someone or something with impeccable credentials because other business sectors might be the next targets.
In fact, there’s already a battle in Los Angeles over the $30 wage for workers at hotels and other hospitality businesses imposed by the city council.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825-Fast-Food-JH-AP-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936

McIver, who alleges that she is the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution by the Trump administration, is seeking communications from a host of federal officials, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
“As we hope is apparent, we have narrowly tailored our proposed scope of discovery to focus on evidence showing that the enforcement and charging decisions in this case were motivated by constitutionally impermissible factors,” Paul Fishman, McIver’s attorney, wrote in a Sept. 3 letter to prosecutors that was made public this week.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark McCarren and Benjamin Bleiberg told Fishman in a Sept. 9 letter that they will not provide the requested documents. They want the judge overseeing the case to rule on the matter.
“Discovery in support of selective prosecution and selective enforcement claims is not provided as a matter of right, and we do not believe your client has satisfied the applicable threshold evidentiary showings required … to compel discovery,” McCarren and Bleiberg said in their letter.
The charges against the congresswoman stem from a May 9 melee outside of Delaney Hall, the detention facility in Newark, that saw federal agents arrest Baraka, claiming he was trespassing. The arrest prompted a scrum as protestors moved to surround Baraka, a Democrat who claimed the jail was operating without proper city inspections and permits.
Authorities announced they were dropping the charges against Baraka days later — prompting a federal judge to admonish them — but moved to charge McIver the same day. The congresswoman and two other members of New Jersey’s House delegation, Reps. Rob Menendez (D-08) and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), were conducting an unannounced oversight visit at Delaney Hall on May 9, and McIver was among the people who surrounded Baraka as agents tried to arrest him.
In court filings, McIver said an agent was overheard that day saying he was going to arrest Baraka at the direction of the deputy U.S. attorney general. Todd Blanche, who holds that position, is among the officials from whom the congresswoman is seeking records.
McIver is also seeking federal officials’ communications about Baraka’s political affiliation and policy views. McIver’s discovery request seeks a range of communications between high-ranking and other involved officials in the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba and her staff.
McIver has in filings argued the charges against her are politically motivated, citing the government’s dismissal of charges against 160 individuals involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress who were charged with violating the same statute.
Alongside officials’ discussions of McIver and Baraka’s political affiliations, the congresswoman also wants communications about Jan. 6 defendants, procedures and policies related to congressional visits to immigration facilities, and officials’ compliance with a federal policy that requires the Department of Justice’s public integrity section to review potential charges against members of Congress.
Two U.S. Supreme Court cases — United States v. Armstrong and United States v. Bass — create a high bar for selective prosecution discovery requests. Generally, they must show that similarly situated defendants were not prosecuted because of an arbitrary classification.
Armstrong and Bass both involved allegations of selective prosecution based on the defendant’s race.
A separate case decided by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals set a slightly lower bar for obtaining documents about selective enforcement by law enforcement agencies, rather than prosecutors, which allows judges to order limited discovery even when a defendant has not met the bar set in Armstrong and Bass.
District Court Judge Jamel Semper will decide what documents federal officials must disclose. It’s not clear when he’ll make that decision or whether he’ll call the parties to discuss it more fully.
House Republicans moved to censure McIver over her charges last week but were stymied after a handful of GOP members, along with all Democrats in the chamber, voted against the measure. Some other Republicans did not vote, and the censure was tabled by a 215-207 vote.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/12/nonsensical-policy-targets-the-very-people-we-want-voting-in-elections-new-u-s-citizens/,"We should be falling over ourselves getting new U.S. citizens to vote, not punishing groups that make it easy for them to do so.","New U.S. citizens celebrate at a naturalization ceremony at Great Falls national park in Paterson in September 2019. Nonprofit groups that register new citizens to vote have recently been banned from these ceremonies by the Trump administration. (Photo courtesy of National Park Service)Last October, about 50 people became United States citizens during an annual ceremony at the Great Falls national park in Paterson.
The city’s mayor, Andre Sayegh, told me one of the newly minted citizens, a woman originally from the Dominican Republic, was excited to be presented with an application to register to vote.
“I’m glad you did this. I’m going to vote for Donald Trump,” she said, according to Sayegh.
The mayor relayed this anecdote to me this week to illustrate the idiocy of a new Trump administration policy barring nongovernmental entities from registering new citizens to vote at official naturalization ceremonies. This asinine decision from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will allow federal officials, the administration claims, to make sure only nonpartisan groups are registering new citizens to vote at events like the one held annually in Paterson.
The real reason, I suspect, is that groups like the League of Women Voters have performed this service, and conservatives believe that group has morphed from a little-old-ladies-hosting-debates organization into one led by fire-breathing lefties intent on electing Democrats. I know many of the people at the League of Women Voters, and I don’t doubt there are progressive members — but the group is also sincerely interested in boosting voter participation, no matter the party.
If you want proof, look at the partnership the league had with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the past, even under the first Trump administration. Melissa Marks, who works at the league’s New Jersey chapter, said the group was even able to store voter registration materials in a closet at the federal agency’s Cranbury office.
“We see ourselves as helping them, as providing a service for them and making sure that their clients, these new citizens, are invited to participate in democracy from day one,” she said.
The Trump administration will probably not change course here, which means it’s incumbent on our state and local governments to fill in the gap.
Sayegh told me he’d love for Paterson to step in and perform this service — but the annual Great Falls naturalization ceremonies have been canceled in a move he thinks is related to cost-cutting at the National Park Service, which runs the park and has lost a quarter of its staff this year, according to the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association.
“I guess they got DOGE’d,” Sayegh said.
A federal building in Newark is also home to regular naturalization ceremonies. Its mayor, Ras Baraka, said through a spokeswoman that he intends to have city officials step in where the League of Women Voters and other groups are being told to stand down.
“Voting is fundamental to being an American and participating in our democracy, so it’s incumbent upon us to ensure all Newarkers have easy access to voter registration. We can, and will, work with our partners to continue to register voters, including our newest citizens, so that each of us has an equally strong voice in the future of our city, our state and our nation,” Baraka said.
So maybe some cities will indeed help here. But will they be allowed to? Marks told me their partnership with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services required a ton of communication to coordinate — will the same Trump administration that is suing places like Paterson over their sanctuary city orders feel like calling Sayegh’s office to make sure he has city officials at naturalization ceremonies to get new citizens on the voter rolls? Seems unlikely.
What’s truly nonsensical about this revamped policy is new U.S. citizens are exactly the kinds of people we want voting in elections. By all accounts, our immigration system places myriad hurdles between an immigrant and their naturalization papers. Someone who jumps over all those hurdles is committed to being a citizen, and probably more civically minded than even some of us who were born on American soil. We shouldn’t simply tell them, “Here’s how you can register to vote.” We should put the application in front of them and say, “You can register to vote right now.”
A strong democracy is one where we are empowering our eligible voters to participate, not one that creates burdens and extra barriers to do so. That’s what this new policy does.

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A South Carolina legislator wants to hear from state universities about safety protocols for campus events following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University this week.
Representatives from state law enforcement, the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, the College of Charleston and Coastal Carolina University will speak to members of the state House higher education subcommittee on Tuesday. The state’s historically Black colleges and universities also have been invited.
“I just want to make sure our colleges are ready and as prepared as we can be for something that’s unimaginable,” the subcommittee’s chairman, GOP Rep. Tim McGinnis of Myrtle Beach, told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions, was speaking at the college in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday as part of his “American Comeback” tour debating with students on college campuses.
At about 12:20 p.m., Kirk was shot in the neck while speaking to the crowd of about 3,000 people, Utah Valley University police have said.
Kirk was then taken by a private vehicle to Timpanogos Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason.
The manhunt for the shooter continues.
Kirk held one of his signature “prove me wrong” events at USC on April 7, when hundreds of students gathered outside the Russell House student center — despite the rain — for the chance to debate him and hear his answers.
USC student event featuring Proud Boys founder draws small protests, no violence

The campus also has played host to other controversial speakers, including Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and podcast host Myron Gaines, criticized for his misogynistic views.
Each of those events drew protests but no reports of violence on the USC campus.
But in light of Kirk’s assassination on Wednesday, plus a series of unrelated, unspecified threats that went out to HBCUs across the Southeast on Thursday, McGinnis said he wanted to check in with colleges in the state to hear any concerns or security needs they may have.
“Until now it hasn’t really come up and now it has,” he said.
With two college-age kids of his own, McGinnis said it’s important to maintain the free flow of ideas and speech on college campuses while also keeping people safe from harm.
“It doesn’t matter who is speaking about what. I just want everybody to feel safe on our college campuses,” McGinnis said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/russell-house-1024x762.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Our country has been testing a promising strategy over the past several years: providing cash directly to families. 
The most prominent examples are the (since canceled) expanded child tax credit under President Joe Biden; Minnesota’s child tax credit passed in 2023; and the guaranteed income programs being piloted in cities across the country, including in St. Paul. 
The promise of this approach is in part the potential benefits for children. Several decades of research have suggested that increasing the income of low-income families could improve educational and developmental outcomes for children.
However, a recent study throws some cold water on that prospect. 
The study is called Baby’s First Years. It examines four guaranteed income experiments (including the site in St. Paul, Minnesota) in which low-income families received $400 a month as part of the experiment. The BFY study selected newborn children at the beginning of the project and then measured the children at age 4. The study examined the 4-year olds on outcomes like language, social-emotional development and executive function. 
The researchers found no differences between the kids in families that got $400 a month and kids in control group families that got only $20 per month. 
The extra cash the families received – $16,000 over four years – appears to have had no impact on child development.  
There may be mitigating factors in these findings, most notably the pandemic, and specifically pandemic policies that provided more cash and other enhanced benefits to all families (while probably exacerbating inflation). In other words, those families in the control group receiving $20 actually received more from other sources during the pandemic, so we can’t be sure of the differences between the two groups. 
These factors could have diminished the impact of the extra cash provided through the experiment. 
But it is hard to simply write off or ignore this study; it’s a gold standard research design and a top set of researchers. 
This is not the last word, of course. Predictably, the researchers call for more research. A follow-up with the children at age 6 is already planned. Outcomes can change based on age. 
But it is disappointing. 
Improving the lives — and life chances — of children in low-income families is one of our nation’s most vexing problems. This is a setback.
Studies that provide unexpected — and, to many, unwelcome — findings can create a backlash. Why bother investing in research if it might support disinvestment in our preferred causes? 
Ideology has a way of coloring how we view research. 
We need to resist that temptation. Public policy is at its best when it is formulated based on quality research and reinforced by continuous learning. 
If we care about the people we are trying to help, we need to invest in solutions that are proven to work.  
But in the real world, tons of public investments are made with little or no proof of effectiveness. Demanding proof can feel like unilateral disarmament. 
This is especially true when research is weaponized by opponents to a policy, as happened in this case. Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a long-time opponent of anti-poverty programs, told the New York Times that the BFY study, “blows the arguments for unconditional cash aid out of the water.”
It doesn’t. It raises questions about one of the anticipated benefits of such programs. 
I don’t think this study is a reason to stop efforts like expanding the child tax credit and experimenting with guaranteed income. 
Why? Well, first and foremost we should stop ignoring the basic reality that we have a service economy with many low-wage and part-time jobs. Parents working full-time or multiple jobs can’t make ends meet. 
Providing direct cash assistance is simply a recognition of that reality. 
And, as I wrote in in this space in 2023, there is little evidence that such policies discourage work. 
Moreover, previous research on the guaranteed income programs found other benefits for families, such as increased financial security, increased food security, more parenting time, more money spent on child activities, and in some cases increased employment. 
These are all meaningful improvements in the lives of families that should stand on their own in support of the efficacy of cash aid.   
The advantage of cash aid is that it is flexible — it allows each family to address their own most critical needs.  
That flexibility may help families manage two escalating cost pressures: housing and child care. 
Our direct efforts to improve the affordability of housing and child care have been, at best, inadequate. Why not just give families cash?
It is also far easier and less costly to administer direct cash aid than targeted benefits like SNAP and housing subsidies. As we’ve seen with the child tax credit, cash aid can be built right into the tax system. 
While I don’t believe the BFY study is, by itself, a reason to stop efforts to provide direct cash aid to families, it does raise questions about how we adjust our strategies for supporting disadvantaged kids. 
Investments in proven direct services for children, like early childhood education and quality child care, should be a continuing priority. 
You know what else? More research. 
Because we owe it to kids to use scarce funding for programs that make a real difference in their lives.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NN200715NeighborhoodWatch615-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

(Getty Images)It’s no secret that Indiana’s voting performance is abysmal. Hoosiers have no problem registering to vote but often don’t make it to the polls.
That’s why I was intrigued by a meeting on two election proposals — moving municipal elections to even-numbered years and expanding vote centers to all counties — held in Indianapolis last week.
Lawmakers mandated that Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales host a series of meetings on the ideas and provide a report for possible action in the 2026 legislative session.
Increasing voter turnout should be everyone’s goal. To me, the vote center proposal is an easy yes.
Instead of having dozens of precinct locations scattered across a county with voters assigned to only one, officials set up a handful of large locations that anyone can use regardless of where they live.

The model is used in 67 of Indiana’s 92 counties. It costs less and requires less staffing. The latter is important as many longtime poll workers age and can no longer volunteer.
Boone County, where I live, moved to vote centers in 2014. It was a smooth transition and has been a welcome change. I have voted in Lebanon on my way to the grocery store or in Whitestown on my way to work. I’m not pinned to only one location — I can fit voting within my day more easily.
I have never waited more than 15 minutes. Counties still need to provide enough machines to avoid long lines, though, and they shouldn’t skimp and set up too few vote centers.
Indiana law requires at least one vote center location per 10,000 voters but I consider that a minimum and believe officials should plan for more than that.
Allen County is the largest that doesn’t use vote centers, but officials there are in discussions to change that. They have 110 polling locations, which would be consolidated into 53 — or one for every 5,000 voters.
A vote is planned for Sept. 15 and must be unanimous.
The second proposal Morales is studying isn’t ready for prime time: moving municipal elections to even-numbered years alongside major races such as president, the U.S. House and Senate, governor, other statewide offices and the Indiana House and Senate.

The data is clear that turnout is much lower in municipal races.
In 2023, for example, turnout in Indiana’s municipal elections was about 27% statewide. That compared with roughly 42% voter participation in the 2022 midterm elections and 61% in the 2020 presidential election.
But that isn’t the whole picture.
Right now, your mayoral race or city council contests are the focus of that election cycle. Candidates, news media and voters can focus on local issues, from growth strategies and road funding to zoning issues and crime.
But if you add those to an already busy ballot, those races will be buried behind federal and state politics. If voters make it all the way through those races — and that’s a big if — they will be without the benefit of a sustained and direct season focusing only on local matters.
Local races in recent years have gained real importance, whether it be related to controversial data centers or solar panel farms. People are paying attention, and I would hate to see that jeopardized.
While those are the only two proposals under consideration, I did want to mention a few other election changes that have been passed in other states to make elections more efficient and flexible for voters.

Extended voting hours. Indiana’s polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Election Day and I think that’s plenty. Especially since Hoosiers have four weeks beforehand to cast an early vote in person at the county courthouse or other satellite location, there is plenty of time for people to vote.
Same-day registration. Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters for the 2024 general election, while the state has a total population 0f 6.9 milliion. And of course, some residents aren’t old enough to vote. I personally don’t think registration is issue. The problem is getting people to the polls. This change would be a heavy lift for no real improvement.
Ranked-choice voting. Some jurisdictions are adopting this and have seen turnout increases of between five and seven percentage points. This option allows voters to rank candidates for an office in order of their preference. If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, that candidate wins, just like in any other election. However, if there is no majority winner after counting the first choices, the race is decided by an instant runoff. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who ranked that candidate as their first choice will have their votes count for their next choice. This process continues until a majority winner, a candidate with more than half of the vote, wins. It’s complicated and I don’t think Hoosiers are ready for it.

I wish I knew the answer to getting more voters to go to the polls. I understand frustration over House and Senate districts, which people may feel are predetermined by gerrymandered maps.
But most races are statewide and local, where every vote absolutely counts.

Following days of speculation about his health from users on social media, President Trump made his first public appearance in a week to announce the moving of Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama (Alex Wong/Getty Images).This column departs from my normal subject of Missouri statehouse issues.
It reflects my concern that Donald Trump’s actions against foreign students could obstruct educational opportunities for students to better understand what is so special about journalism in the U.S. compared with other countries.
One of my objectives as founder of MU’s State Government Reporting Program was to help my international students understand their reporting powers in the U.S. because of the significant freedoms, court protections and just as importantly the importance of professional standards for journalism in the U.S.
It was a two-way street because from my student discussions with my international students from less-free countries, my American journalism students gained a better appreciation of the legal protections in the U.S. and journalism standards that make our country so special.
By way of background, for many years, in addition to hosting journalism students from other countries to cover Missouri’s state house with my American students, I also conducted international workshops for journalists around the world.
The subsequent positive feedback from my foreign students and foreign journalists have reminded me of President Ronald Reagan’s 1989 farewell address describing the Capital as the “shining city upon a hill” which he credited to an earlier phrase by John Winthrop who used the phrase to refer to the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he had been governor.
For many of my state house students, I sensed that Missouri’s state house was “shining light upon a hill” because of the open debates among public officials my students covered including the consequences for misbehavior by public officials to major policy debates and learning about the right for state house journalists to report those stories.
I fear the Trump administration’s action against foreigners in our country could have a profound impact on that understanding by both foreign journalism students and U.S. journalism students about the importance for journalism from the legal protections from federal court decisions.
One of the best examples of legal protection came in 1964 when the U.S. Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited lawsuits against public figures without proof of malice — defined as knowledge that the outlet knew the information was false or acted in reckless disregard as to whether the information was true or not.
Although a major victory for journalists, the lawsuit actually involved an advertisement in the New York Times from a civil rights organization, not a news story.
Another example from the Supreme Court came later in 1971 when the court upheld the right of the New York Times to publish classified documents from a government source that outlined the complicated history of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war.
I now fear that the actions of President Donald Trump and his administration could undermine what I sought to inspire in my international journalism students and professionals about the “shining light” of U.S. freedoms that empower U.S. journalists and the public’s right to know as well as the standards of my profession.
In fact, I wonder how students from other countries would react to that phrase “shining light” for a city now patrolled by military troops with military gear, vehicles and weapons.
If I still were an active journalism faculty member, the current actions by Trump’s administration might make me hesitant to sponsor international students to Missouri, knowing they could be subject to arrest or removal without judicial review.
I suspect many faculty from other countries with whom I worked also may have second thoughts about sending their students to the U.S. because of the financial cost and educational disruption for a foreign student being barred from continuing academic study in the U.S.
Discontinuing these exchange programs would be a loss not only for foreign students but also for U.S. students who learned from my foreign students about how special are the rights and standards for journalists in the United States, as well as the issues U.S. students could face when reporting in other countries.
On a more positive note, U.S. courts have become more forceful, ordering judicial reviews before deportation and restricting recent administration actions against persons from other countries.
So, maybe future students from other countries will appreciate Ronald Reagan’s expression of the nation’s capital as “a shining light.”
By way of background, for many years, in addition to hosting journalism students from other countries to cover Missouri’s state house with my American students, I also conducted international workshops for journalists from around the world in which I stressed U.S. legal protections for journalists but also U.S. journalism standards.
In less-free countries, I sensed journalists were inspired about the legal freedom and, just as importantly, the professional journalism standards in the U.S.
I also must confess a family history because my mother’s parents in Torrance California volunteered to maintain the local nursery of a Torrance Japanese family after they were forced to an internment camp under the Alien Enemy Act during WWII until the family was released and returned to their home.
The Alien Enemy Act, now used by Trump, was invoked during WWII to intern thousands of U.S. citizens of German, Japanese and Italian origin.
The actions of my grandparents and my dad’s WWII service remain a deep inspiration for me.
If you want to know more about the Japanese internments, search the web site of Manzanar at https://www.nps.gov/manz/index.htm.
Having climbed and backpacked from my father’s original birth-home to that area to the top of the Sierra
Nevada overlooking Manzanar decades after the internments, I can vouch for the website’s photos of how harsh was the desert environment and the oppressive heat.
Also, check out “They Called Us Enemy” by George Takei and others about his internment because of his Japanese ancestry. He starred as Sulu in the TV show Star Trek.
On the other side, President Roosevelt’s invocation of the Alien Enemy Act came after a Japanese submarine attack on the California coast.
And some of my relatives told me about growing resentment from some in Californian had about the growing Japanese immigration into the state.
My relatives obviously did not agree with that resentment and, in fact, helped me better understand the contributions of Japanese to my state’s growth and history.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trumpsept22025_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

Combined, the 21 grants across four Indiana higher education institutions total $24.5 million in federal dollars from the National Institutes of Health, as detailed by Grant Witness, an independent tracking effort. The project partly relies on self-submitted cancellations, meaning the losses could be higher.


An additional $15.5 million in grants to Indiana schools under the National Science Foundation was canceled. Under that program:

Indiana University’s Bloomington campus lost $6.2 million


Ivy Tech Community College lost $238,000


Purdue University lost $8.3 million and


Notre Dame University lost $642,000



More than half of the canceled project dollars from the NIH, or $14.3 million, were dedicated to projects at Indiana University in Indianapolis, specifically the School of Medicine. University officials didn’t respond to emails or phone calls requesting comment.
Purdue University lost nearly $6.2 million, followed by Notre Dame University’s $3.2 million. Indiana University’s main campus in Bloomington had just three projects for a combined $641,000 — but two of those projects may be restored following legal battles. 
One of those includes a five-year project to increase condom use among adolescent boys who are gay, bisexual and queer. The digital education program focuses on affirmative consent, identifying coercion and communicating with partners about desires and boundaries, according to an IU press release from earlier this year. 
“Oftentimes adolescents don’t know how to ask to use condoms. They feel awkward talking about it to their partner because it implies they don’t trust them, so they don’t take that risk because they want to keep the peace in the relationship and maintain harmony,” researcher Hannah Javidi said in March. “But they are putting themselves at risk by doing that, so we want to build up that confidence and have them feel comfortable advocating for the use of a condom, as well as refusing unwanted sexual activity or ending a sexual encounter halfway through if they decide they aren’t feeling it — all of which I see as a part of consent.”
At the time, Javidi said she hoped to roll out an updated version of the program in the fall. 
Ten days after that release, NIH canceled the project. According to Grant Witness, just $35,000 remained of the $196,000 allocated in this round of funding. That budget was potentially restored following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the American Public Health Association, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and Ibis Reproductive Health. 
The ACLU of Massachusetts, which spearheaded the legal battle, got a district court to rule in their favor in June, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed course in August in a narrowly divided ruling. 
It’s unclear where that puts Javidi’s project and another IU Bloomington effort, which analyzed the effectiveness of pop-up clinics in diabetes prevention for rural, Hispanic Hoosiers. Both were part of the ACLU suit, according to Grant Witness. 
A separate Purdue project, which started in 2020 to study COVID-19 vaccines, was potentially reinstated in a separate lawsuit filed by several Democrat-led states. That lawsuit focused on projects with appropriations from various COVID-19 laws.
A KFF Health News story found that blue states, many of which filed lawsuits challenging the cancelled NIH grants, were more likely to see reinstated funding — meaning that red states like Indiana that didn’t challenge the move lost out.
 The canceled projects

Submitted projects spanned the gamut, from kidney disease and substance abuse prevention to studying pediatric cochlear implant users and preparing minority undergraduate students for rigorous research programs. 
In all, four projects sought to either support underrepresented minority groups in their education or combat sexual harassment. These studies were flagged for including specific references to gender, sex, race, inequality, inclusivity or diversity in their projects. 
Several of the projects sought to build upon prior studies, adding to ongoing treatment research. These studies include a $2 million award to University of Notre Dame chemistry professor Juan Del Valle, who is studying a type of molecule bonding common in certain Alzheimer’s patients and finding ways to selectively disrupt it. His colleague Mayland Chang received an award for $771,000 to study an aspect of Clostridioides difficile, or c-diff, infections. The deadly bacteria doesn’t have an antibiotic treatment and kills thousands of Americans every year.


“The NIH is an important partner in helping to advance critical research at the University of Notre Dame — research aimed at fostering new discoveries in the biomedical sciences and health that contribute to the common good,” a Notre Dame spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “Recently, the agency updated its mission and priorities in alignment with the new administration. As a recipient of NIH funding, we are actively monitoring the situation and working to understand the impact thus far.”
The school noted that two other projects weren’t included in the Grant Witness database, meaning their total grant loss was closer to $4.7 million, not $3.2 million.
Del Valle’s research was flagged by the NIH for the words “trans” and “diverse,” according to Grant Witness. The project’s abstract refers to cellular transmission at various points and “diverse modes of b-sheet packing.” Chang’s research, on the other hand, doesn’t have any flagged words. 
The use of the word “barrier” might have sunk a $5.7-million Indiana University School of Medicine glaucoma study. Professor Jason Meyer, a molecular geneticist, sought to identify ways to replace certain cells within the eye’s nerve that are damaged by glaucoma, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. 
His project’s title? “Overcoming barriers to retinal ganglion cell replacement in experimental glaucoma.”

Another biochemistry study was flagged because of its focus on triple-negative breast cancer, which researchers identified as “the deadliest form of breast cancer, (affecting) Black/African American women at twice the rate of white women.”
The team identified a certain type of enzyme — Adensine Deaminase Acting on RNA, or ADAR — required to grow these cancer cells and sought to explore potential treatment avenues.
“This work will advance our understanding of ADAR- dependency such that we can accurately classify ADAR-dependent (triple-negative breast cancer), thus opening the door to treating this deadly form of breast cancer…” the study’s abstract reads.”Developing an effective targeted therapy for (triple-negative breast cancer) is essential to reducing the disparate effects of this disease on Black/African American women.”
However, many research projects are still ongoing. A Sept. 5 research update from Purdue University notes that 97% of its $1 billion in research funding “remains intact.” Additionally, the school reported receiving $74.9 million in grants in July, a 20% increase from the previous fiscal year.
NIH grants do more than provide funding. For students and researchers breaking into their respective fields of study, these dollars also support the next generation.
Speaking about his mentee’s grant to study the relationship between substance use and chronic pain, Indiana University’s Patrick Quinn praised Alynna Summit’s NIH award that would “jumpstart” her academic career. Summit received a two-year fellowship grant totaling $97,948 last September. She already spent the first year of funding, but the second year has been canceled.
“It’s designed as a launching pad for a research career and so it also offers really great training opportunities to get Alynna to the next stage,” said Quinn. “It isn’t just about Alynna developing out a research project to pull apart these two subjects that hang together in ways we don’t fully understand, but also to think about what resources Alynna will need to set her up for success in her career.”

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State StandardTACOMA — A former Washington state worker who admitted to embezzling nearly $900,000 in taxpayer funding to finance his gambling addiction was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in federal prison. 
Matthew Ping, an ex-employee at the Office of Administrative Hearings, will also need to pay $1.1 million in restitution for the money he stole and unpaid taxes on it.
Before the fraud case, Ping filed for personal bankruptcy four times, in 1999, 2005, 2012 and 2018, court records show. In the 2018 bankruptcy, the year before his embezzlement began, Ping reported $190,000 in debt.
A state audit found the office’s internal controls to prevent the type of fraud Ping carried out were inadequate. 
Ping, 48, had worked at the state agency since 2009. 
In May 2019, Ping reportedly received about $4,900 in salary payments from the Office of Administrative Hearings, which handles disputes between state and local government agencies and residents. That month, he withdrew at least $3,800 at western Washington casinos. By the end of the month, his checking account was overdrawn.
The next month he began stealing public money, according to court papers. 
As a management analyst, Ping had an agency credit card, and was the only employee with access to the office’s bank statements, according to court papers. His salary in 2022 was $82,500, according to Washington’s payroll database. 
The defendant set up a fake company, called RCC Professional, to funnel money from his work card directly to his personal bank account, according to court documents. The payments would appear on bank statements like legitimate transactions.
Between 2019 and 2023, Ping used this scheme to steal nearly $861,000. Over this time, he created three other fictitious businesses to hide his fraud, according to court documents. He also reportedly used his agency credit card to make $17,000 more in personal purchases.
Ping’s public defender, Lindsay McCaslin, acknowledged “of course he should’ve stopped.”
“But addiction is compulsive, by definition,” she said in court Thursday, adding that treatment resources for gambling addiction are minimal compared to other disorders.
Ping spoke in court, as well, noting he called a gambling hotline, only to be directed to a local clinic with a 13-week wait for an appointment. Ping has now been getting treatment for months and hasn’t gambled for over a year, he added.
Ping apologized for his actions in court.
“From the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry for the hurt that my actions have caused and I take full responsibility for them,” he said, and referring to his coworkers, added “the shame I feel for hurting them will never go away.”
The fraud was the largest state agency misappropriation in at least 15 years, according to state Auditor Pat McCarthy.
He used the money for at least a half-dozen trips to Las Vegas and to pay off a loan for a used Mercedes-Benz, prosecutors say. Casinos comped Ping’s hotel rooms in Las Vegas, his attorney said.
At the height of his gambling, Ping received many such perks, including sports game and concert tickets and thousands of dollars in free play per week, he said. 
Ping didn’t report any of his newfound wealth on federal tax returns, resulting in a $240,000 tax loss. 
Federal prosecutor Dane Westermeyer noted in court Thursday that the defendant was paid to work while embezzling, on top of his fraud and unpaid taxes.
“Mr. Ping effectively stole from Washingtonians three times over,” Westermeyer said.
Ping took a number of steps to further circumvent the agency’s policies for approving credit card transactions, so his fraud would go unnoticed.
The years of theft were only discovered when state auditors launched a normal audit of his office and asked questions about his fraudulent payments. He resigned in summer 2023.
Ping pleaded guilty to wire fraud and filing a false tax return in June of this year. Under federal sentencing guidelines, he faced 37 to 46 months in prison. 
Prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright to sentence Ping to 2 ¾ years, a prison term below the standard range, followed by three years of probation. The defense requested no prison time, instead pushing for five years of probation and a year of electronic home monitoring.
Cartwright decided on a middle ground, noting the way Ping’s addiction consumed him while also weighing how a prison sentence could serve as a deterrent for future offenders.
“I really hope you can find a way to tell your story about how you ended up in this place that can be helpful to others,” the judge told Ping.

Insurance covered $628,000 of the Office of Administrative Hearing’s losses, so that portion of restitution will go to the insurer. 
After the state audit uncovered deficiencies in the office’s oversight of credit card payments, the agency committed to implementing a number of new safeguards. That included giving several employees access to credit card statements and requiring more documentation to support each charge.
“I want to assure everyone that when the misappropriation was detected, OAH immediately took steps to protect the agency and the public from further loss,” said RaShelle Davis, the office’s chief administrative law judge, in a statement. “We implemented all the recommendations of the State Auditor and integrated ongoing oversight and monitoring to ensure those controls remain effective.”

This story by Randolph T. Holhut and Jeff Potter was first published in The Commons on Sept. 9, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — The Windham County Heat Fund, with the help of a $20,000 matching grant, is kicking off a major fundraising campaign and a benefit concert to support people who have relied on federal fuel assistance that will no longer be available.
The Heat Fund — founded in 2005 by Brattleboro residents Richard Davis and Daryl Pillsbury — was intended to help county residents who fell between the cracks of this social safety net, and the two friends have prided themselves on keeping the organization small and nimble over the years.
In a typical year, Davis said, the heat fund raises about $50,000, and he and Pillsbury have handled its administration the old-fashioned way — by looking the people in need in the eye, talking with them and connecting them with fuel.
But with federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program on the chopping block, the Windham County Heat Fund — which has been a supplemental source of local aid sustained by two volunteers and their force of will — faces the pressure of becoming the primary source of relief for people who can’t afford heat this winter.
“My fear is that people are going to try and sign up for heat assistance, and they won’t get it,” Davis said. And if this happens, he said, “people are going to die.”
He said the match will be used toward the organization’s newest initiative: to launch a GoFundMe page with a goal of $100,000. Every dollar of the first $20,000 donated will be matched by the trust, doubling donors’ contributions. 
The heat fund will also hold a concert, “Save a Life,” to kick off the start of the fall fundraising effort on Sunday, Sept. 14, at 7 p.m. at the Heart Rose Club (the former Shriners Building), 11 Green St.
Performers will include Daniel Kasnitz, Jennie Reichman, Stan Davis, Duane Young and the trio of Patty Carpenter, Jeremy Gold and Verandah Porche.
A looming crisis
This year the need is greater because the Trump administration has cut off the ability for the federal government to provide fuel assistance, with LIHEAP caught in the cuts of the first months of Trump’s term.
Congress approved $25 million for the program, despite the administration’s cutting the funding entirely from the Trump budget.
Instead, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., fired all the employees in the Division of Energy Assistance, which administered the LIHEAP program.
“The money has been allocated (by Congress), but there’s no one to give it out, and no one in the administration seems to be concerned about that,” Davis told The Commons.
Last year, the state of Vermont received $20 million and, according to U.S. Sen. Peter Welch’s office, that funding will most likely not be available this year. Welch, along with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, have been pressing unsuccessfully for reinstating the employees.
The program is administered by the state through its Department of Children and Families, which work with regional community action organizations like Southeastern Vermont Community Action (SEVCA) in Westminster and with local fuel vendors. Davis has found no sense of urgency at the local or state level.
“Nobody seems to know that there’s a problem,” Davis said. “Normally, the money is released at the end of November. The local fuel companies like Cota & Cota and Dead River say many of their customers are on fuel assistance, and they don’t know what’s happening.”
Davis said he is grateful that the Thompson Trust is stepping up with the matching money for the crowdfunding drive.
The charitable foundation distributes income from the fortune of 19th-century philanthropist and art dealer Thomas Thompson, who established it to help “poor seamstresses, needle-women and shop girls” in Windham County and in Dutchess County, New York.
Courts have loosened those constraints, and the trust more generally funds causes in the two regions, with a special emphasis on health-related projects.
But Davis said that philanthropy can’t fully make up for the loss of federal funding.“There’s no way we can make up for this loss,” Davis said. “I really don’t know why more people aren’t worried about this.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)For the second time, a federal trial in the 2020 shooting death of Alvin Cole by then-Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah ended in a hung jury on Thursday. Deliberations began shortly after 5 p.m. on Wednesday, going until around 8 p.m. Jurors returned Thursday morning, and deliberated for a total of nearly 10 hours, more than doubling the amount of time deliberations lasted during the first trial, before deciding that they were hopelessly deadlocked. Plaintiff attorneys asked the jury for a total of $9 million ($5 million in compensatory damages, and $4 million in punitive damages), a figure far lower than the $22 million they asked for last time. 
Following the trial, Mensah attorney Joseph Wirth said “it’s still proven a difficult case for the jury to reach a conclusion.” Wirth and his partner, attorney Jasmyne Baynard, declined to talk about settlement discussions with the media, but said they plan to talk to the jurors. “We have felt strongly about the merits of this case,” said Baynard. “I’ve felt strongly about my representation of Joseph Mensah and every other police officer that I represent. Feel strongly about his actions in this situation, and we’re going to go forward under that belief.”
Cole family attorneys Kimberly Motley and Nate Cade said that while they wanted a different outcome, “We are pleased that it was a hung jury.” Motley stressed that “it’s important for the public to be aware that Joseph Mensah killed three people in five years as a Wauwatosa police officer, that’s really important, and that this jury did not believe what he was saying. Now we have a jury that came back — and they were hung — but they deliberated longer, they had more evidence, and the evidence is just not good for him.” Motley said that Mensah’s story “doesn’t make sense.”
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
During deliberations, jurors asked for transcripts of interviews of officers on the scene of the Cole shooting conducted by the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), a request initially denied by Judge Adelman, due to questions about whether the interviews had been admitted as evidence. Later, Adelman reversed his decision and allowed the jury to see MAIT interviews of officers David Shamsi and Evan Olson. The two officers gave contradicting statements to MAIT investigators in 2020 about whether Cole moved or pointed his gun shortly before Mensah fired. Jurors also asked for Mensah’s deposition testimony, in which plaintiff attorneys say Mensah implied that when he fired on Cole, he was only concerned about his own safety. On the stand this week, Mensah said that he fired to protect himself and everyone else around Mayfair Mall. 
Throughout the trial, defense attorneys argued that the unrecorded officer interviews by MAIT were little more than hearsay, and attempted to limit the jury’s access to them. Besides arguing that MAIT reports are hearsay in the second trial, defense attorneys noted in the first trial that officers are not under oath when they talk to investigators after a police shooting. The debates in court raised questions about the policies and practices that MAIT relies on when investigating officer-involved deaths, which also inform whether prosecutors will charge officers with crimes after killing civilians. 
Baynard said that “I don’t think that we’re in a position to comment on MAIT’s investigation, and truly that was not really an issue in this case to be decided, so no, I don’t have any issues.” Baynard added that, “I have seen plenty of MAIT investigations, I have seen plenty of investigations done by the [state Division of Criminal Investigation], I think they did a fine investigation here. I think that sometimes people forget that officers in these situations are afforded the exact same rights as anybody else would be afforded, and beyond that I’m not really interested in commenting on MAIT’s protocol.”
Cade stressed that the MAIT statements “are not heresy, ’cause they’re the statements.” Calling the heresy argument “nonsense”, Cade said that the problem with MAIT “is that they allow the officers to make decisions about it being recorded.” While Cade accepts that Mensah himself may have Fifth Amendment rights in such a case he said “the other officers don’t”. By contrast, civilian witnesses are recorded far more often than officers after police shootings. “Why do they bend over backwards for officers who are not even directly involved in terms of shooting,” asked Cade. “That’s a handicap. They said that MAIT was supposed to be designed to give the public confidence. How can you have confidence if you’re not going to tape officer’s conversations, so we know exactly what they said?”
Wirth said that Mensah “is absolutely disappointed that we weren’t able to obtain a verdict today,” adding that Mensah is no longer in law enforcement, “and it weighs heavily on him.” Wirth said “it’s a very important case to the Cole family, it’s a very important case to Joseph Mensah.” 
The last day of testimony
On Wednesday defense attorneys called Joshua Boye, a video editor and graphic designer who reviewed squad car video from the Cole shooting. Boye testified that he had been paid by defense attorneys to edit the video as they directed by modifying audio, adjusting color and contrast, and adding a “spotlight” around Cole as he ran.
During cross examination, plaintiff attorneys drew attention to a timestamp in Boye’s video which does not appear in the raw version, leading plaintiff attorneys to question whether Boye had been given an altered version by defense attorneys. Later on, when this issue was raised again, Judge Adelman said that he hadn’t seen anything to suggest that the video had been tampered with. Boye repeatedly said that any edits he made to the video were done “at the direction of attorneys.”
Wauwatosa officer Evan Olson, who was one of the officers who responded to Mayfair Mall the night that Cole was killed, testified as uniformed Wauwatosa officers flowed into the courtroom to sit around Mensah’s wife, as they had during each day of the trial. A Wauwatosa PD spokesperson said in a statement to Wisconsin Examiner that “some officers chose to attend the trial in uniform to show their support for a former colleague, which is not uncommon in high-profile cases. Their attendance was voluntary and did not impact patrol staffing or the department’s ability to respond to calls of service.”

Cole’s family, as well as the parents of Jay Anderson Jr., Mensah’s second fatal shooting in 2016, also attended every day of the trial. Motley and Cade took issue with the presence of uniformed Wauwatosa officers. “This isn’t the city of Wauwatosa,” said Motley, “so I was kind of concerned about what was happening in the city of Wauwatosa with all these police officers that came in uniform to sit in court for hours and hours, for a person who no longer works for Wauwatosa as a police officer, and is no longer a Wauwatosa officer period. So I think that the taxpayers should demand why that happened.”
Cade called the uniformed officers’ presence intimidating for the jury. “We aren’t allowed to say anything about the thin blue line and backing the blue, but it was obvious,” he said. During the first trial plaintiff attorneys were told that the Cole family was not allowed to wear any clothing with messages about Alvin. 
Olson testified that he arrived at Mayfair Mall responding to a report about disorderly conduct  involving a gun. After arriving, Olson immediately encountered at least two teens who were part of Cole’s group, and ordered them to the ground. Off in the distance, he could see Cole running from officers and mall security, before hearing a single shot. Olson testified to seeing Cole “in what I would say is a low ready position,” similar to a stance taken in football. He said that Cole pointed a firearm at him, making him move out of the way of what he thought would be more gunfire, and prepare to shoot himself. Olson called Cole a “lethal threat”, and said that after Mensah fired, Cole went from the football-like position to lying prone on the ground. Plaintiff attorneys argued that Olson was seeing Cole in the act of falling. Olson kicked the gun from Cole’s hand and assisted in CPR. 
Olson, Mensah and Shamsi gave contradicting statements, opening  the door for the trial. Both Olson and Mensah said that the gun was pointed in their directions, but they were positioned on opposite sides of the parking lot. Shamsi, who was the closest officer to Cole, testified that Cole and the gun didn’t  move after Cole fell. Olson said he didn’t think other officers who didn’t see the gun move were lying. Every officer testified that foot pursuits are dangerous, unpredictable situations especially when guns are involved. 
When Olson left the stand, he took a seat in the gallery near Mensah’s wife and the other Wauwatosa officers. Olson, like the rest of the officers, was uniformed every day of the trial. On Thursday, when the jury continued deliberations, Olson and a Wauwatosa police sergeant came to court in civilian clothes.
Sarah Hopkins, a civilian witness, claimed to have been outside the Cheesecake Factory restaurant when she saw Cole being chased by mall security. Hopkins said that Cole stopped running at one point, making her think that he was surrendering, but then that he turned and pointed a gun at the officers. Hopkins said that Cole “was like fumbling around” and that “all of a sudden we hear rapid shots.” Plaintiff attorneys questioned the fact that Hopkins described Cole doing a motion which no one else described seeing. Davion Beard, a former Mayfair Mall security guard, initially helped to locate the group of teens, and participated in the foot chase. Beard, who ran track, testified to essentially being the closest person to Cole with just a foot or two separating them. When the first shot was fired, Beard said he dropped to the ground, with Shamsi not far behind him, and that he didn’t see Cole crawl, turn his body, or point a gun.

Testimony concluded with Mensah’s attorneys calling Michael Knetzger, a certified instructor in Defense and Arrest Tactics (DAAT) and former Green Bay police officer. Knetzger repeatedly implied that the jurors should put themselves in Mensah’s mindset at the moment of the shooting. When cross examined, plaintiff attorneys drew attention to Knetzger’s lack of “real world experience” dealing with shootings and homicides, and that his doctorate and degrees had come from online universities including one that marketed itself as the nation’s “most affordable online Christian University.”
During closing arguments Cade reminded the jury that Cole was a kid who made stupid decisions like many young people, including his own sons who Cade called “knuckleheads.” Cade stressed that “for Joseph Mensah to be right, everybody else has to be wrong,” referring to the testimony from multiple officers, Beard, and other witnesses that Cole had not turned toward Mensah or moved after he fell to the ground. Cade said that Olson testified to support his friend Mensah, and that Mensah himself had  incentive to change his story.
Attorney Baynard, representing the defense, said that Cole made “catastrophically dangerous” decisions which went beyond the sort of mistakes people make when they’re young. Baynard said that “police are not required to gamble with their lives”, and that while Cole’s death was tragic, “we are in court today because of his actions.” Baynard said that “Cole was in control of the situation” and that “he was driving the bus”, saying in her closing argument that “I’m not sure how many more opportunities he should have been given to comply.” Baynard described the turning motion Cole allegedly made as “a quick shift,” and made claims about prior witness testimony which Cade later refuted.
The Cole family said they are undeterred by Thursday’s hung jury. “We’re a strong united family,” said Tracy Cole, Alvin’s mother. Despite the hung jury, Cole said that she is encouraged because “somebody sees that my son was killed for no reason,” and that she believed her son was killed as he attempted to surrender. 
“We are going to fight you Joseph, we ain’t gave up Joseph,” she added. “And my lawyers ain’t gave up.” 
Motley echoed the sentiment. “It’s a good result,” she said of the hung jury, “and we’re going to keep fighting…because this is an important case.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Assembly Republicans passed a handful of bills Thursday on an array of issues. Democrats argued the measures won’t solve the problems facing Wisconsinites and unveiled their own proposals. 
The Assembly floor session is the first since lawmakers broke for the summer after completing the state budget. The Senate does not plan to meet this month, and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) told reporters during a press conference that it was a “shame” they wouldn’t. She said she has had conversations about meeting in October. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said Republicans’ agenda for Thursday was an example of “prioritizing culture wars” rather than “doing what’s right.” 
Democrats’ education bills
Senate and Assembly Democratic lawmakers proposed their own package of education bills ahead of the floor session that would increase general aid for public schools by $325 per pupil, provide transparency on voucher school costs and provide free school meals to students. 
“We would like to see our legislative Republican colleagues focus on the issues that are facing Wisconsinites — issues like cost of living, their public schools and their property taxes,” Neubauer said. “That’s why we’re bringing forward this package today, because we know from conversations with our constituents what they’re really concerned about.”
The Democrats’ education agenda  contrasts with the plan announced by Assembly Republicans earlier this week. Republican proposals include encouraging consolidation of schools, calling on Gov. Tony Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, banning drones over schools and improving math education.
One Democratic  bill would dedicate $325 in additional per pupil state aid to Wisconsin school districts. It would cost nearly $500 million for 2025-26 and nearly $700 million for 2026-27. 
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) called it the “bare minimum” that school districts need and said it would help school districts avoid raising property taxes. 
“School districts will do better under this bill than current law,” Roys said. “We know every kid around the state deserves to go to a great school so that they can meet their potential, but to be clear, this bill is not everything that our kids need or deserve, not even close.” 
Wisconsin’s most recent state budget did not give school districts any increase in per pupil general aid, despite calls from education advocates, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats to provide additional funding.
Republican lawmakers said they would not increase state aid after  Evers used his partial veto power to extend a cap on the annual increase to limits on the revenue districts can raise from local taxpayer of $325 per pupil for the next 400 years. Without state funding, school districts only have the option of increasing property taxes to bring in the additional funds. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects that property taxes will increase by more than 7% on average over the next year.
Roys said the bill is a “test” to see if Republicans want to help keep property taxes stable, since providing no state aid to schools will drive those taxes up. She blamed Republicans for placing districts in a situation where they have to go to property taxpayers to keep up with costs. 
Roys also knocked a Republican bill that would encourage school districts to explore consolidation and sharing services. 
“They want to consolidate school districts. They want to close schools, and by the way, everything’s the governor’s fault. Give me a break,” Roys said. “They want to hold the line on property taxes? Prove it.” 
The bill also includes an additional $31 million to ensure no school districts receive less state aid in 2025-26 than they received in 2024-25. 
The Department of Public Instruction’s July 1 estimate found that 277 districts — or 65.8% — of school districts were going to receive less in general aid from the state in 2025. 
Another bill seeks to provide greater transparency on the costs of voucher schools to districts by requiring property tax bills to include information about the cost. The bill would expand on a push that public school advocates are making at a local level after the city of Green Bay was able to add the information. 
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said the bill would help inform residents who may be confused about where their tax dollars are going. 
“We can say, time and time again, that the state is underfunding our local public schools. That is true. What they also don’t understand, and there’s a really simple fix, is how much of that money is leaving their district to go to other voucher schools. In some cases, millions and tens of millions of dollars… It is a simple fix. It is very straightforward,” Andraca said.
Requiring in-person work for state employees 
AB 39 would require state employees to return to in-person work for at least 80% of their time — or four days a week for a full-time employee — starting this year. The bill passed 51-44 with all Democrats opposing it. 
The bill initially required state agency employees to be in person the whole week, but an amendment dropped the minimum to four days. 
Republican lawmakers have been calling for stricter limits on remote work for several years. The policies became normal for state employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Nedweski said she isn’t “anti-telework,” but said remote work needs to be managed and measured. She said agencies haven’t provided data to show it is working. During the Assembly Committee on Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency hearing on the bill, agency leaders said remote work policies have helped with recruitment and retention of employees.
“It’s time for state employees to return to the office and do the work that Wisconsin’s hard-working taxpayers are paying them to do to the best of their ability and in their most productive and efficient way,” Nedweski said. “We have a policy that allows for remote work agreements. We’re not saying the policy is ending, we’re saying, come back, have your performance evaluated and re-sign your remote work agreement.” 
Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the ranking member of the GOAT committee, pointed to the testimony they heard as he argued the bill wouldn’t help.
“A bill like this with a one-size-fits-all return to work policy will not make our state government better… Remote work policies were born from a crisis, and we all remember too well. They’ve  become a success for our state government. We now have state workers dispersed all across the state. We’ve achieved savings by consolidating physical workspace. We’ve stayed competitive with the private market by appealing to how employees want to work and then what they expect from their work environment.” 
Flag prohibition
AB 58 would prohibit flags, other than the United States flag, the state of Wisconsin flag and a few others on a list of exceptions, from being flown outside state and local buildings including the Wisconsin State Capitol. The bill passed 50-44, along party lines. 
Rep. Jerry O’Connor, the author of the bill, argued that flags are part of the reason for increasing divisiveness, and even political violence. Wisconsin leaders condemned political violence during the session after the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday.
“It’s not the role of the government to pick the winners and losers on partisan and activist issues,” O’Connor said. 
Some of the exceptions would include local government flags, those commemorating veterans, prisoners of war or missing in action, those recognizing a foreign nation for special purposes and a flag of a unit of firefighters, law enforcement officers or emergency medical technicians. 
He said these exceptions are “simply recognizing those flags that are efficiently recognized by all levels of government.”
“We should have a shared outlook as to what we do as elected officials in this building here to promote unity and not division… I think we all could agree that those are the flags that represent all of us,” O’Connor said. 
Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego) spoke specifically about pride flags, which are a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community, when explaining his support of the legislation. 
“You’re asking every Wisconsinite to sanction what that means,” Wichgers said in reference to the Progress Pride flag. The chevron portions of the flag include black and brown stripes to represent people of color who identify with the LGBTQ+ community as well as those living with HIV/AIDS. The light blue, pink and white stripes in the chevron represent transgender people.
“I can guarantee you when you ask the people that are in favor, they’re not going to know what that chevron means, so we’re endorsing, sanctioning something that is being flown above our flag that is probably divisive,” Wichgers said. 
Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) said, however, that she views the bill as being divisive and as a violation of the First Amendment. 
“I think as a body we should be promoting inclusiveness. It’s not just the more morally right thing to do. It also strengthens our communities, promotes mutual respect, and actually leads to more civic engagement,” Sinicki said. “These symbolic acts do matter. They matter to me, and they matter to the majority of people across Wisconsin.” 
Prohibit health services funding for immigrants without legal status
AB 308, coauthored by Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan), passed 50-44 along party lines. The bill would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the United States.
Dallman said at a press conference that the bill is meant to stop Wisconsin from expanding its Medicaid to cover immigrants without legal status. Wisconsin already doesn’t allow this. 
“This is going to take a step forward to say that we are going to again keep these funds available for our citizens who are paying in all these dollars,” Dallman said. 
Advocates expressed concerns to the Examiner earlier this week that the bill would lead to health service providers having to check everyone’s citizenship status before providing care.
Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) said the bill is “the kind of thing that makes people hate politics.”
“We don’t provide health care to undocumented immigrants. The reason we’re voting on this today is so that the majority party can go out and tell their voters that Democrats failed to stop giving health insurance to undocumented people, but we can’t stop something that isn’t happening. Why waste time and taxpayer money this way?” Stroud said. “If you don’t have affordable health care, they don’t want you to hold them accountable. Instead, they want you to blame someone else.”

(Photo courtesy the Indiana State Library)The state’s ethics watchdogs met behind closed doors Thursday as questions mounted around former Indiana Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green, whose recent resignation followed a remediation agreement connected to an inspector general investigation into potential ethics violations.
The Indiana State Ethics Commission met for less than 20 minutes in an executive session Thursday morning in Indianapolis. 
Although Green’s case was not listed on the public agenda, commissioners were scheduled to privately consider a probable cause affidavit and “an individual’s alleged misconduct.” 
It’s not clear what they discussed specifically or if any decisions were made. Commissioners declined to comment following the session.
Remediation document reveals ethics concerns before Indiana cabinet secretary resignation

The meeting came just days after reporting revealed that Green signed a remediation agreement with state officials earlier this year. That document outlined a series of allegations against Green, including claims that she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal and political purposes, and that she directed state employees to assist with those activities during work hours.
Additional accusations center around inappropriate workplace conduct, ranging from “conversations with employees about personal relationships, intimate subjects, or sexual activities,” to “uninvited touching of employees” and retaliation.
Green denied most of the allegations, although state officials said she admitted to “limited” personal use of state vehicles and “having a financial relationship with an employee” without disclosing the conflict of interest.
The document, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, shows Gov. Mike Braun’s office allowed Green to remain in her secretary position “pending the results of the Office of Inspector General investigation with appropriate safeguards in place to prevent additional ethics violations, including additional ethics training.”
The governor’s office confirmed Indiana’s inspector general made a confidential referral of personnel related findings that were outside the scope of their jurisdiction on Sept. 4. The governor reviewed that report the morning of Sept. 5, and instructed his staff to discuss the findings with Green immediately. During that meeting, Green resigned.
How the process works
Complaints about possible ethics violations are first submitted to Indiana’s Office of Inspector General. Anyone can make a request through a confidential hotline, online form or in writing. After an initial review, the office decides whether the matter falls within its jurisdiction and merits a formal investigation.
If a probe is launched, investigators may interview witnesses, review documents and issue subpoenas, according to state statute. The OIG compiles records that remain confidential unless they are later filed with the state ethics commission.
When investigators believe they have “specific and credible evidence” of wrongdoing, they can seek a probable cause finding from the commission.
At that point, the OIG prepares a probable cause affidavit, which serves as a confidential summary of the evidence. Commissioners review that affidavit behind closed doors to determine whether probable cause exists.

OIG Spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland emphasized that decisions made in executive meetings are “administrative in nature — to determine if a matter will advance to a public proceeding.” If the commission chooses to move forward, the case will appear on a public agenda with the respondent’s name attached.
Per state law, complaints filed with the ethics commission remain confidential until commissioners make a probable cause finding. If probable cause is confirmed, the inspector general files a formal complaint that becomes open to public inspection, though certain details can still be redacted. 
McFarland said a formal complaint only becomes a public record once it is officially filed — a process that can take up to 30 days, including time for notifying the respondent.
The commission must then set a public hearing, where witnesses and evidence are presented.
If the commission ultimately finds an ethics violation, it can impose sanctions that include fines and other penalties. Some cases, however, are resolved administratively by the inspector general without ever reaching the commission, often through a settlement agreement.
When evidence suggests a criminal offense may have occurred, state law further requires the OIG to certify that evidence to the appropriate prosecutor. Ethics commission proceedings only deal with administrative law, not criminal law. 
That means the prosecutor — not the inspector general or the ethics commission — decides whether to bring criminal charges.
What is public — and what is not
Most of the OIG’s investigation process takes place outside public view. Intake records and investigative files are confidential. The probable cause affidavit itself is also not disclosable, McFarland said.
The pivot to public disclosure comes only if the commission finds probable cause. At that stage, the complaint and related hearing documents become available for public inspection, with some redactions allowed.

If a prosecutor later pursues criminal charges, those filings appear in the public criminal docket.
In 2018, for example, a separate, high-profile state ethics investigation centered around former Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill — who was accused by four women of unwanted touching at a late-night bar gathering.
The investigation was prompted by requests from the four leaders of the Indiana General Assembly. The probe included dozens of witness interviews, as well as multiple subpoenas for surveillance video and other evidence, according to an investigative report later released by the OIG. Hill also provided a video-recorded statement.
Although the inspector general’s report was critical of Hill’s behavior that night, he was determined not to have violated ethics laws. A special prosecutor assigned to the case additionally declined to press criminal charges.
But in other proceedings before the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, a hearing officer found that Hill committed misdemeanor battery and violated ethics rules related to public esteem for the legal profession. 
The Indiana Supreme Court later suspended Hill’s law license for 30 days.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)As students return to school across the state, one thing is clear: Oklahoma’s leaders are not committed to improving education for our students. 
In addition to continuously failing to adequately invest in our public schools, Oklahoma leaders have long undermined students’ education through a variety of policies, such as promoting election lies, marginalizing trans youth, and disinvesting from public schools that serve 90% of Oklahoma students. 
While these sorts of attacks are not new, this year leaders seem particularly eager to target Oklahoma students with an immigrant background by passing or attempting to pass policies that directly harm these students.
For instance, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have revoked a policy that allowed some immigrant students lacking legal status to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities. The regents made this change after a federal judge affirmed Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s joint request with Trump’s U.S. Department of Justice to end the practice, which had been Oklahoma law for almost 20 years. 
That law allowed some immigrant students to pay in-state tuition rates if they had lived in the state for at least two years before graduating from an Oklahoma high school. To qualify, students also had to submit a notarized affidavit attesting that they were seeking, or would seek, lawful immigration status. 
Attending college is already expensive enough for Oklahoma families, with annual in-state tuition and fees at OSU and OU costing $13,920 and $15,135, respectively. Charging out-of-state tuition prices would more than double those costs, raising the price to $29,440 and $33,255. In a time when we are facing labor shortages for professionals like doctors and nurses, it does not make sense to effectively bar hundreds of Oklahoma high schoolers from attending college in the state they call home solely because of their immigration status. 
This policy will do nothing to address the broken immigration system in the United States. All it will do is punish Oklahoma students who already live in and contribute to our communities, want to pursue higher education, and who intend to continue giving back to our state — yet currently have no way to adjust their immigration status. 
Of the 44,000-plus students who graduate from Oklahoma high schools each year, immigrant students who qualified for the in-state tuition rate make up fewer than 1,000. Out of these, about 400 are currently in college and would be affected by the ruling. 
Our attorney general is publicly targeting a tiny fraction of future college-bound high school students and current college students for his own political gain. 
State leaders have also targeted young students. 
Earlier this year, state Superintendent Ryan Walters proposed an administrative rule to collect the immigration status of children who enroll in public schools. Although the rule was ultimately rejected by the Legislature, it created a lingering fear in immigrant communities that schools would become part of the immigration enforcement apparatus. 
These fears, compounded by heightened immigration enforcement and toxic rhetoric towards immigrants from state and federal leaders, will have devastating impacts on families and students’ education. 
Years of research have shown that heightened immigration enforcement increases absenteeism and negatively impacts students’ academic performance, consequences that will impact students far beyond the classroom, as education is closely correlated to future earnings and health outcomes. Unfortunately, many of these concerns have already materialized, with schools nationwide already reporting higher absenteeism rates following immigration raids, as parents decide to keep their kids at home rather than risk separation.
As the new school year begins in Oklahoma, the federal effort to target communities with immigrants will have real impacts, potentially lowering students’ attendance rates and academic performance significantly. But Oklahoma’s families also face attacks from our very own state leaders, who are choosing to pander to federal leaders rather than protecting students.
Instead of playing politics with the lives of our families and children, Oklahoma leaders should focus on strengthening education — passing policies that support schools, boost attendance, and encourage students to seek higher education. 
Oklahoma’s future depends on whether we choose fear and division or invest in every student’s right to learn, thrive, and contribute to our state.

The Black Butte mine now has access to an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal — enough to keep the mine in production through 2039.
The post Feds fast-track coal mining expansion in southwest Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration this week expedited approval of a southwest Wyoming coal mine’s expansion.
The Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement completed its environmental review for the Black Butte coal mine plan in under 30 days, according to the Interior Department. Typically, a federal environmental review, which includes volumes of documents regarding environmental, socioeconomic and health impacts — along with public input — takes at least a couple of years.
The updated plan essentially allows for continued production at the mine that has been scooping coal west of Rock Springs since the late 1970s. It gives the mine access to an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal — enough to maintain mining through 2039, according to federal documents.
“This is great news for southwest Wyoming and for Wyoming energy consumers,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a prepared statement.
Gordon blamed the Biden administration for delaying the mine’s expansion, claiming the Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement continually added “paper obstacles” to the review process. 
“If this way of doing things becomes normalized, then you can basically justify doing anything on public lands.”Emma Jones, Sierra Club, Wyoming chapter
“After the Biden Administration ignored my earlier requests to move forward with this approval, it is most gratifying that [Interior] Secretary [Doug] Burgum took action and expedited the review of the Environmental Impact Statement on the Black Butte Mine Expansion,” Gordon said. “Once more the Trump administration is demonstrating its commitment to a wise, multiple-use approach to public lands and minerals in Wyoming.”
Interior officials noted that the push to approve the Black Butte mine expansion was under the direction of President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry executive orders — the same push to advance a 440 million ton coal lease and a 14.5 million ton expansion at the Antelope mine in northeast Wyoming.
Some conservation groups say the administration is moving too quickly to fully analyze environmental and human health impacts, or to allow for thorough public input on such federal coal actions.

“The government is not doing their due diligence to actually examine the impact this might have on public lands,” Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Climate and Energy Organizer Emma Jones told WyoFile. “They don’t know what the impact is, really. If this way of doing things becomes normalized, then you can basically justify doing anything on public lands.” 
The Trump administration has retooled implementation of federal leasing and permitting actions under the National Environmental Policy Act, speeding up the process as part of Trump’s declaration of a National Energy Emergency. Though energy — particularly electricity — demand in the U.S. is skyrocketing, it’s unclear whether such federal actions will help pull the U.S. coal industry out of its severe 10-year decline, conservation groups, including the Sierra Club, say.
“It’s unclear who is going to buy this coal,” Jones said, regarding the Black Butte mine. 
The nearby Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant has served as the Black Butte mine’s primary customer for decades. Sierra Club and others have speculated whether the power plant’s owner, utility giant PacifiCorp, will continue to rely on the mine as it has in the past. The company recently converted two of four coal-burning units at Jim Bridger to natural gas. Black Butte employs about 56 miners, according to federal data. The workforce there suffered two layoffs in recent years, most recently in the summer of 2024.

Health department kicks off statewide meetings to gather information on how $500-800 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funds can help the state over next five years.
The post Amid health care access worries, Wyoming could receive millions in short-term federal dollars appeared first on WyoFile .","Though critics have decried President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a means to strip Medicaid and insurance coverage from tens of thousands of Wyoming residents, supporters point to a bill provision aimed at boosting rural health care. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to funnel $50 billion to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Wyoming, one of America’s most rural states, stands to receive $500 million to $800 million from the program over the next five years, according to the health department.
Before it applies for the money, however, the state wants to pin down Wyoming’s highest-priority needs. The Wyoming Department of Health will kick off a string of public meetings on Friday aimed at gathering input on rural health care challenges and opportunities. 
Meetings begin Friday in Newcastle and wrap up Oct. 2 in Laramie. A virtual gathering is scheduled for Sept. 23. 
“Local voices will guide us in identifying where investments make the most difference and how the state can play a constructive role in making the most of this unique opportunity,” Stefan Johansson, director of the Wyoming Department of Health, said in a release. 
Those fighting for better health care access in Wyoming aren’t totally sold, however. The federal funds could certainly be helpful, Healthy Wyoming Executive Director Jenn Lowe said, but with a five-year time limit, they won’t likely do enough to make up for the recent and expected losses incurred in a state that already struggles with a dearth of resources. 
“It sounds significant, but it really is just a drop in the bucket,” against the background of aggregate needs, Lowe said. 
Still, she added, “people who care about health care access in Wyoming should absolutely go to these meetings” to help shape how those funds can be spent. 
Eroding landscape
With its rural characteristics, Wyoming has long struggled to provide affordable and accessible health care. Hospitals struggle to hire and retain doctors and nurses, service lines like baby deliveries have eroded and patients travel hundreds of miles for treatment. 
Several recent factors converging on both the state and federal levels further threaten access to care in Wyoming.
“Costs will go up for just about anybody who purchases insurance in the state, and access to care is likely to go down,” Lowe told an audience at a recent health care forum in Lander.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. That will result in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid. 
As one of the few states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid, Wyoming will avoid some of the immediate hits, experts say. But it will still likely result in coverage losses as well as other downstream effects. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, a new economic analysis finds. 
The Wyoming Medicaid program covers 62,000 patients, according to Families USA. Some 46,000 residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
That second patient pool is also anticipated to see major changes. Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill does not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients. 
According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The organization anticipates that the tax credit sunset puts somewhere between 11,000 to 20,000 Wyoming residents at risk of losing their coverage.
“These tax credits have been a lifeline for folks in Wyoming to afford health care insurance,” Lowe said.

A shrinking pool of insurance providers is only expected to further exacerbate the issue. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. 
In addition, the nonprofit Enroll Wyoming, which offers free help to those seeking health coverage, saw a roughly 90% cut in funding in August. The organization has transitioned from a 10-person staff to 1.5 full-time employees. While much smaller, Enroll Wyoming still endeavors to assist residents, a press release stated. 
A major investment 
Republicans pushed back on criticism of their bill’s health care impacts, pointing to programs contained in it that they say will boost rural care. 
In remarks lauding the bill’s passage, Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a physician, said it strengthens health care, “especially in rural communities.” He pointed to a renewed push for innovative care, hospital support and Medicaid work requirements as benefits.
“I practiced medicine in Casper, Wyoming, for over 20 years,” Barrasso said. “The changes in this law will strengthen Medicaid for the people who truly need it.”
One of the bill’s offshoots is the Rural Health Transformation Program, which will supply $50 billion to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Half of that money will be divided among states that submit applications. The idea is to let states determine the best use of funds.  
According to the Wyoming Department of Health, program funding is intended to support priorities that include chronic disease prevention, behavioral health, access to care in rural communities, workforce development and technological advances. 
In addition to the eight in-person meetings around the state, the department will collect input by sending out a survey later this fall to refine the priorities. 
A healthy dose of skepticism
The program promises a significant infusion of funds into Wyoming’s health care network, and supporters say it does so with a common-sense approach. 
“The [program] is designed to help all rural hospitals, not just those in states that have been gaming the system,” reads a Senate Finance Committee fact sheet. “But for the states that need help re-focusing their Medicaid programs, the RHTP can serve as a bridge to shore up rural hospitals and prevent gaps in care.”
Lowe, however, doesn’t see it as a panacea. Programs spawned from it will likely require funding beyond the five-year window, she said. And that’s not her only concern.

“I think that it’s fair to say that whenever large chunks of money like this are pumped into grant-funded programs,” Lowe said, “some of those programs prove to be successful and some might even be revolutionary in how they treat rural health care. However, there will also be boondoggles, and there will be bridges to nowhere where funding is spent and nothing ever happens.”
That’s why it’s crucial that people partake in the process now, she said.  
“I think it’s imperative that people pay attention to what’s going on in Wyoming to ensure that … this money is not wasted, that it’s spent in a way that leaves a long and effective program in its place.”

So busy, according to park officials, that on peak days more than 1,000 people flock to the site, and annual visitations tally more than 160,000. 
“Use at Taggart Lake has increased more than 100% in the last 10 years,” Superintendent Chip Jenkins said. That compares to a 20% growth in overall park visitation, showing just how appealing it is. 
Facilities are no longer adequate to serve the 700 or so average daily visitors, and park officials have sketched out a plan to expand the parking lot, reconfigure trails, install new toilets and improve other aspects of the trailhead area to accommodate mushrooming use. 
Grand Teton National Park is seeking comment on an environmental assessment of the project. The 35-day comment period closes on Sept. 23. 
During a Wednesday presentation on the environmental assessment, Jenkins said the so-called preferred alternative would create a more accessible and capacious site that would help protect the resources. Park data documented numerous instances of fecal matter and toilet paper near Taggart Lake in 2022, according to the assessment. 
“We think that this preferred alternative will help us make for a better Taggart experience and for a better Grand Teton experience,” Jenkins said.

The project is estimated to cost $14.6 million to construct, with the Grand Teton National Park Foundation providing more than $10 million of that. Much of the remaining expense will be funded through appropriated federal dollars, primarily through the National Park Service Centennial Challenge, Jenkins said. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2026. 
The project underscores how Grand Teton and neighboring Yellowstone are wrestling with growing visitors who are filling parking lots, crowding trails and putting a strain on park services like bathrooms and search and rescue. 
A park hotspot 
As a launching-off point for popular hikes near the park’s southern entrance, the trailhead is one of the most common places for people to start their visit to Grand Teton, Jenkins said. It’s also a well-used parking spot for skiers setting out on winter adventures.
Site maintenance has not kept pace with usage growth. Park officials have been gathering public comment on the Taggart Lake experience for the last year to guide improvements to the site. Proposals are mapped out in the environmental assessment. Under the preferred alternative, the project would:

Expand the parking lot.
Install new permanent toilets and a water station. 
Redesign the trailhead area and create more accessible pathways. 
Make improvements to the Taggart Lake shoreline to better define access points. 
Improve facilities at the nearby Cottonwood Creek Picnic area. 

Objectives of the plan include better safety for bicyclists and better protection for nearby wildlife, according to the assessment. 
The environmental assessment also contains a “no action” alternative, under which Grand Teton would continue to maintain the project area as is.

If the preferred action option takes place, the Taggart Lake trailhead upgrades would be among several construction projects scheduled for the park through 2028. 
Zooming out
The busy Taggart Lake trailhead underscores the broader challenges growing visitation presents to national park managers. 
Grand Teton and Yellowstone both reported record visitation in 2021. Visitations dipped since then, but the overall trend is still climbing. 
Right now, Grand Teton is on track to tally its second-highest year for visitation, Jenkins said. Yellowstone, meanwhile, has tallied 3.5 million recreation visits through August, up slightly from 2024 but still behind pace to top 2021. 
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” Jenkins said during a congressional field hearing held in the park last week.

Though both parks have implemented measures like camping reservations, vehicle limits at crowded lots and a pilot shuttle system, they have yet to adopt more drastic tools like timed-entry systems that Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have adopted to manage huge crowds. 
Public lands advocates are keeping a close eye on national parks this year in the wake of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts. Since the Trump administration took office, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association. 
It appears Wyoming’s parks avoided the brunt of those cuts. Yellowstone National Park’s 2025 staffing is higher than last year, a park spokeswoman told WyoFile.

Greg Gianforte speaks to the property tax task force on what he wants to see in a report later this year. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Sometimes you really have to ask yourself: “Just how dumb do Montana’s politicians think we are?”  
The latest example comes as Governor Gianforte announces he’s appointing an energy task force to “unleash American made energy in our state.”  Yet, while claiming an “all of the above” approach, only a very naive person would believe this is about anything except “unleashing” more climate-killing coal and fossil fuels. 
It’s well documented in the policy arena that there are any number of reasons politicians appoint task forces.  

A task force provides handy cover for those so-called “leaders” who lack the courage to simply state their goals and have an open public debate about the pros and cons — and take the “slings and arrows” that arise.
 It provides the illusion of considering all the options and whittling those down to what provides “the greatest good for the greatest number.”
Those special interests likely to benefit from the task force recommendations can deny they exerted raw political power to benefit themselves.  In the meantime, the token appointees from, say, the “green” community actually think they might be taken seriously. 
And finally, there’s no guarantee whatsoever that all of the task force recommendations will be adopted and implemented — well, unless they forward the pre-determined goal of the politician who appoints it.  

Gianforte’s energy task force covers all the bases.  
He’ll have “recommendations” to follow, not decisions for which he is personally responsible.  
It provides the illusion of considering all options, which ignores the fact that the governor and entire Congressional delegation have already lined up behind unconditionally expanding Montana’s coal mining and burning, “drill, baby, drill,” and “American energy dominance.”  
All of this is predicated upon the equally facetious claim by Trump that the nation has a “national energy emergency” which, like the rest of his phony “emergencies,” is ginned up to circumvent long-held and prudent “look before you leap” procedures, including public opportunity for review and comment and analyzing environmental impacts. 
It provides NorthWestern Energy — which has run roughshod over Montana’s utility sector while ripping Montanans off with ever-more-expensive power — the ability to claim the “consensus” of the task force, rather than the actual fact that it has kept the gov in its back pocket all along.
And finally, any token recommendation to use renewable resources like solar and wind will fall by the wayside since Trump has already slashed funding and implementation of most solar and wind projects – including those already funded by Congress such as the “Solar for All” program.
Let’s not beat around the bush.  NorthWestern Energy is merging with Black Hills Corp. with the clear intent of developing and exporting Montana’s energy resources to at least an eight-state area.  
When it comes to environmental impacts, Gianforte’s director of the Department of Environmental Quality, who will chair the task force, has already given away the game.  Claiming Montana has “a long history of responsible energy development” ignores the fact that Colstrip has a Superfund-size pollution footprint on land and groundwater.  Yet, the task force will “identify barriers” to development rather than consider mitigating impacts. 
Montanans have watched endless task forces come and go while the politicians do what they planned on doing — or not doing — all along.  And don’t worry, no one will ask why we need massive data centers to serve a mere million Montanans scattered across the nation’s fourth largest state.  After all, we have to “meet the demand” like always.  
You’ll have your energy task force, governor, but Montanans won’t be fooled — we’re not as dumb as you think we are.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_5780-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

A story shared on social media, while unverifiable, holds an important kernel of wisdom about mending divides, columnist David Romtvedt writes. 
The post On the need to open ourselves to others appeared first on WyoFile .","The news: Where do we get it? How do we know what to trust? How do we see through material that has been distorted or is simply untrue and meant only to manipulate us as readers and as citizens in a troubled democracy?

Opinion

The other day, I received a Facebook post sent by a friend who received it from a friend. This post was written by a person who said he’d been told the story by a person who was an acquaintance of a friend of his — that is, the storyteller heard it from a person who had a friend who heard the story from an acquaintance of that friend.
Here’s the story: Two people are in line at the check-out counter of a pharmacy. One is an older man — maybe late 70s. The other person is a woman whose age is unknown, but we will soon learn that she is married and has a daughter. The older man is wearing a MAGA hat. The woman is wearing a T-shirt that says “Liberal AF.” We’re told the pharmacy is in a deeply blue city in an even more deeply red state — Iowa.
The man says to the woman, “You liberals are a cancer on our society.”
The pharmacy clerk is speechless. No one moves. Even time seems to stop.
The woman thinks to keep her mouth shut, but something wells up in her — our political situation and the threats against democracy both in our country and worldwide, her personal life, how some days we feel we can take no more. At the end of our rope, we speak.
She says, “My daughter has cancer, and you can call me what you want — a liberal, a fascist, whatever, but I know what cancer is. I know what it’s done to my daughter, what it’s done to me, to my marriage. I pray to God each day that I might take my daughter’s place. So don’t call me a cancer.”
Or maybe she says, “I am not a cancer.” Either way, she goes on to tell the reader that surely this man, who appears to be in his mid-to-late 70, has had a loved one suffer from cancer, has seen what cancer does to both victim and loved one, and has faced the death from cancer of someone he cares about. The woman begins to cry — she’s angry about crying in front of this man and these strangers in a public place. But she cries.
Now the man is chagrined. He apologizes profusely, asks the woman to forgive him, offers to pay for everything in her cart. But she doesn’t want him to pay. She says, “Tell me, 10 years ago, would you have said something so thoughtless and so cruel to a stranger in a store?” She adds, “Be honest.” As if in asking for honesty, we will be given some guarantee.
The man says, “No.”
Ten years ago, he would never have said such a thing. He wonders what he can do, and the woman asks him to throw away his MAGA hat. Maybe if he throws the hat away, he will once again be the more compassionate person he once was. Leaving the store, the man does what the woman has asked, taking off his hat and tossing it into the trash bin.
Now the clerk recovers the power of speech and says something like, “Oh, my God. That was unbelievable.”
The first comment below this story was to ask if the woman would throw away her Liberal AF T-shirt. This seemed to me beside the point because the woman had not verbally attacked the man. The comment obscures the fact that I have no idea if the event really happened. 
It’s a heartening story, and I hope it happened. I hope that when pushed, we see the limitations of our bitterness towards others and the truth that wishing others didn’t exist will never get us anywhere in our search for a just and fair democracy, a society in which all are treated with equal concern, where all stand an equal chance to make a life that is personally enriching in community with others, both those we feel are like us and those we imagine are unlike us.
Maybe it doesn’t matter if the event actually took place. Maybe what matters is its inner truth, that we can be changed by opening ourselves to the other. And if we were to do this, I think my doubts about the sources of information I receive might go away, that I could trust what I saw — even on Facebook — because we’d have no need to manipulate one another in public in pursuit of our private ends.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Across panels and speeches on the second day of the North Carolina AFL-CIO convention on Thursday, labor activists called to fight back against the Trump administration’s federal layoffs and funding cuts.
Amid deep cuts to the federal workforce brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, speakers at the labor convention said unions must present a united front or risk losing hard-fought worker protections and many of their jobs entirely.
Christine Surrette, who serves as vice president of District 4 of the American Federation of Government Employees, warned federal layoffs — which have cut more than 200,000 government employees since January — will slow economic growth and erode public safety.
“It’s going to affect our veteran hospitals, our veterans — a lot of veterans are being laid off,” Surrette said. “I mean, National Park Services, we don’t have enough people to work for them now.”
Those impacts, she said, are not contained to the federal workforce. “There will be no work for the contractors,” she said. “No matter what union we’re in, what city we’re in, it’s across the nation.”
Alvin Warwick, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 342 in Greensboro, said the end of Biden era programs around clean energy and electric vehicles have cost more than 10,000 jobs in the sector.
“Terminating these tax credits is the equivalent of terminating 1,000 Keystone XL pipelines,” he said. “It stands to be the biggest job-killing program in history.”

Jemma Superville, an assistant director with National Nurses United, said politicians are demonizing workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and stripping resources from the department as part of a long term effort to privatize the agency entirely.
“Our veterans have worked and have earned the right to their benefits, and therefore it means that we will stand with them to ensure that they get those rights,” she said. “We will not back down from that. We are the fiercest advocate to ensure therefore the protection of veterans, and we accept that role very seriously.”
She warned that privatization would only make health services for veterans more unreliable, remarking that when she tried to schedule a procedure to remove a small skin tag on her shoulder, she could not get one before February 2026. “Could you imagine, to deal with our veterans with their highly specialized issues, for which they don’t have the skills or the knowledge to deal with it?”
A registered nurse at the VA, Superville urged members of Congress to support the Protect America’s Workforce Act and the VA Employee Fairness Act — calling on them to sign discharge petitions to bring the bills to a vote.
Duke Graduate Student Union member Noah Jacobs said federal cuts have largely manifested on campus in the form of lost research funding from the National Institutes of Health as well as for Duke Health, the university’s medical services and education system. Those cuts have manifested in lost jobs for workers.
“What we’re seeing so far is the Duke administration has decided to make sweeping 10% cuts across the board, all departments — but of course, those cuts have not been equal. You all may have read the news that Duke cut 1,000 staff people’s jobs,” he said. “Basically, Duke’s administrative strategy has been staying silent in the wake of all these attacks.”
Jacobs said he was proud that his union was able to come to an agreement on their first contract with the university after two years of negotiations, expressing hope that it would help protect workers in the face of federal threats. He said as far as he was aware, all staff cuts were to non-union positions.
NC AFL-CIO general counsel Trisha Pande spoke on changes to the National Labor Relations Board under the Trump administration, recapping the president’s removal of the agency’s general counsel as well as of member Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman appointed to the board. She also outlined the Trump administration’s termination of contracts with federal workers’ unions on grounds of national security.

“There’s no sugarcoating it — our labor laws and our federal agencies are under attack. But unions have come together to challenge those attacks in court,” Pande said. “We are fighting not only through legal action, but with our voices, our votes, and our solidarity.”
April Verrett, president of the Service Employees International Union — a two million member union that reunited with AFL-CIO in January — also urged labor organizers to challenge the administration in a speech Thursday. She condemned not only labor actions by the Trump administration, but the mobilization of the National Guard in American cities and raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement throughout the country.
“We are organizing everywhere, in airports, in hospitals, in classrooms, in courthouses and in coffee shops. We are not just playing defense,” Verrett said. “We are taking the fight directly to corporations and the politicians in their pockets who think that we’ll stay silent.?Because we know the truth. We know that it is our power that they want to dismantle. It is our power that they want to decimate.”
Verrett said labor activists need to turn to “radical imagination” to empower them to stand up against violations of their rights.
“We are not going to be afraid, we are not going to be divided, ’cause we got to be ready,” she said. “We are ready for a country where every job comes with dignity, not disrespect. We are ready for health care that heals, that does not bankrupt. We are ready for wages to let you live and not just barely survive.”
On the first day of the NC AFL-CIO’s annual gathering, Gov. Josh Stein urged lawmakers to back an economic agenda that centers working families by improving access to child care, education, and health services. NC AFL-CIO members will select a successor to longtime president MaryBe McMillan on Friday.
Following the conclusion of the convention Friday afternoon, members of the nurse’s union and supporters plan to demonstrate at Sen. Ted Budd’s Wilmington office in protest of cuts to the VA. Superville, the NNU speaker, told audience members it will be a “defining moment” in their fight to win back labor protections.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9113779-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

In its budget request released this month, the department said the supplemental budget request is needed to pay providers on time — because Medicaid expenses are forecasted to go above the agency’s set budget for fiscal year 2026, which ends in June 2026. 
If providers aren’t paid, it could “lead to providers no longer contracting with Idaho Medicaid, impacting availability of services for those in need,” according to the budget request. 
Recent cuts to provider pay rates, expected to save nearly $30 million this year, prevented the supplemental budget request from being even bigger, said Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron, who will soon become the director of the Department of Health and Welfare.
The rising Medicaid costs that drove the need for the supplemental budget request stem from higher health care costs — with more people seeking health care services, and more intense services, she said.

 Request comes amid tough year for Idaho’s state budget 

Supplemental budget requests are common for Medicaid because the program’s budget is set based on projections that could be wrong.
But this supplemental budget request comes as Idaho faces a tough year for the state’s budget. 
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
After the governor’s executive order for mid-year budget cuts, Health and Welfare announced it would cut Medicaid reimbursement rates for all provider types and services by 4%. The agency is accepting public comments on the cuts, which are already in effect. 
The supplemental budget request for Medicaid faces a tough path forward, said State Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat who serves on the Legislature’s powerful budget-setting committee.
“What is happening currently is that you’re seeing the Republicans who are controlling the Legislature being more and more hostile to the vital services that Medicaid provides for working families,” Wintrow said in an interview. 
“We would not be having this discussion had it not been for $400 million in tax rebates, $50 million in voucher schemes that we said — I hate to say I told you so — we said would break the bank,” she continued. “And now the bank is broken. And we are here trying to fund basic services for people with disabilities, people who are aging, pregnant women and kids.”
 After budget holdbacks, Health and Welfare expects to spend less money than the Legislature, Gov. Little approved

The supplemental request was included as part of Health and Welfare’s budget request for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July 2026. 
The Department of Health and Welfare expects to spend less money this fiscal year than the Legislature and the governor initially approved this spring, anticipating about $5.99 billion in expenses compared to the $6.01 billion in appropriations. The budget request for fiscal year 2027 — which includes estimates of how much the agency will spend this year — already accounts for the governor’s ordered 3% mid-year budget cuts, Charron told the Sun. 
For fiscal year 2027, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare — which is Idaho’s largest state government agency — requested about 4.1% more funds in the next fiscal year than it expects to spend this fiscal year. 
If approved, the agency’s budget next fiscal year would grow from about $6 billion a year to $6.23 billion — by nearly a quarter billion dollars. 
Nearly $3 million next year would go toward implementing a sweeping Medicaid cost-cutting law passed this year, which called for work requirements, changes to how officials verify Medicaid eligibility, and a shift to private companies managing benefits.

The agency is also gearing up to downsize staffing to about 2,905 full-time positions next fiscal year, down from the 2,990 it expects to have this year and even lower than the nearly 3,030 it was approved to have this year. 
The budget request is one of the first major steps in the process to fund state government. 
In January, the governor typically releases his own proposed state budget. Then the Idaho Legislature, which usually meets during the first few months of the year, considers budget requests by state agencies and the governor as lawmakers craft budget bills.
 Medicaid’s budget is based on projections. That’s why it often has supplemental budget requests. 

Medicaid often has requests for additional funds in the middle of the state’s fiscal year — which are called supplemental budget requests. That’s because the program’s budget is set based on estimates that can change, but its responsibilities are spelled out in state and federal law. 
Earlier this year, the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee approved $415.2 million in supplemental funds for Medicaid last fiscal year. But in 2024, the budget-setting committee accepted a nearly $278 million reversion from Medicaid for funds the program was allotted but didn’t spend in fiscal year 2024. 
Idaho Medicaid administrator Juliet Charron testified before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on House Bill 345 on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Charron said the rising costs that required the supplemental budget request this fiscal year were largely driven by the traditional Medicaid population, which includes groups such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, rather than people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, which is a policy that covers lower income earners.
Agency officials are still digging into that to see whether specific services are driving the increasing costs, Charron said. 
“But I think what we’re also seeing is that the Legislature has made some really important investments in services, because we have historically had access issues and needed to make some rate increases,” she said. “… Access has opened up, and so we’re seeing individuals receiving services.”
If the $60 million supplemental Medicaid request isn’t approved for fiscal year 2026, “provider payments will need to be held until” fiscal year 2027, according to the budget request, and the same amount will be needed then. 
An error with Luma — the state’s new business system that been the subject of critical audits — also drove the supplemental budget request, officials say. Charron said about $22 million in general funds were supposed to have been released in the state’s 2025 fiscal year, but instead got released this fiscal year. 
 Medicaid work requirements, twice-a-year eligibility checks included in budget request for fiscal year 2027

For fiscal year 2027, Health and Welfare also requested roughly $2.9 million to go toward work to implement a Medicaid cost-cutting law passed this year, through the Idaho Legislature’s House Bill 345, and the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
One request for $1.87 million would go toward Medicaid work requirements, which would include changing the eligibility system to process and track work requirements and exemptions, finding a vendor for work management, and supporting “participants in securing full-time employment, ideally with benefits or at a sufficient wage to allow them to purchase coverage” through the state’s insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, according to the budget request. Funding for that request would be split between federal funds and the state’s general fund.
A separate $1 million request would go toward changing Medicaid eligibility systems to shift toward twice-a-year annual eligibility checks, up from the once annual checks in place now. That change would be mostly funded by the federal government, which would contribute $900,000, compared to Idaho’s contributions of $100,000 from the state’s general fund.
Both requests call for new staff — for a total of 17 positions. But the agency said it will transfer funding for vacant positions for the roles.

The audit reviewed the tribe’s financial records from 2024, when the tribe’s former chairman resigned amid reports of an alleged investigation into his use of a separate credit card for Coushatta Casino and Resort, which the tribe owns and operates.
Louisiana state law requires independent financial audits for indigenous tribes that own casinos. The same requirement applies under federal law for any organization that receives $1 million or more in annual government assistance.    
The audit results were made public last week by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office. In addition to an overall look at the tribe’s financial standing, the review included credit card charges from two unspecified months last year totaling more than $387,000.

The review by the SJT Group accounting firm of Albuquerque, New Mexico, found there were no receipts for $105,416 worth of purchases over the two-month period. Tribal policy requires all credit card purchases above $50 to have supporting receipts that must be produced monthly for the spending to be properly categorized. 
Auditors reported 344 purchases without supporting receipts, and that 167 of the sampled transactions had no associated business documentation to account for $100,254 of the total reviewed charges. 
The review also included $73,515 in travel expenses charged to the tribal credit card. According to the audit report, “all travel-related credit card charges should include a travel request
form, stating the business purpose of the transaction.” Tribal policy also requires an expense report for any travel paid for with its credit cards.
The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana’s tribal council declined to answer specific questions about the audit. In a statement to the Illuminator through spokeswoman Mary Patricia Wray, the tribal council said it has taken steps to improve its financial accountability, including eliminating council credit cards and adopting a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy. 
“This Council is proud that we have put in place more accountability measures, but disappointed those efforts were not cited or recognized in the audit report from our partners at the State of Louisiana,” the statement said.
Tribal secretary and treasurer Kristian Poncho will complete a review of credit card policies by the end of September, according to the tribe’s response to the report provided to the legislative auditor. 
The stricter measures come after former tribal chairman Jonathan Cernek resigned in August 2024, according to a KPLC-TV report. Other news outlets have reported Cernek is allegedly under investigation by the FBI, the National Indian Gaming Commission and Louisiana State Police. Cernek is reported to have made at least $350,000 in personal charges on two casino credit cards.
The FBI and the National Indian Gaming Commission would neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation related to Cernek.
The SJT Group report also reviewed unresolved findings from similar credit card documentation issues in the tribe’s previous audit.
When analyzing two months of credit card statements from 2023 totalling $312,027, auditors found 338 transactions worth $111,697 had no receipts. A hundred transactions had no associated business documentation to account for $103,804, and travel forms were not available for 20 trips totalling $55,619.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton said Thursday he favors sending a federal-state combo “strike force” into Memphis to cut down on gang activity there.
In the latest episode of “To deploy or not to deploy,” Sexton told reporters he and other state officials are talking to the Trump administration about sending National Guard troops to the West Tennessee city. The Crossville Republican said he supports more federal resources in Memphis with limited use of Guard personnel, possibly at night to maintain law and order.
In addition to a role for the National Guard there, Sexton said the state needs to activate an “anti-gang unit” or “strike force.”
“There’s over a hundred gangs in Memphis right now that are doing most of the crime damage and shootings and everything,” Sexton said.
The speaker said newly-appointed U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant could help with prosecutions, bypassing Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who is considered soft on crime by Republican lawmakers.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order two weeks ago directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to set up quick strike forces that could be deployed in the nation’s largest cities.
Tennessee governor not ready to deploy troops to Memphis

Gov. Bill Lee, who sent Tennessee Guard troops to Washington, D.C., said last week anything is possible with deployment, changing his tune a bit after saying the previous week that sending troops to Memphis wasn’t under consideration. Initially, he defended his stance by pointing toward a 15% decrease in Memphis crime over the past year.
Democratic state Rep. Jesse Chism of Memphis last week responded to calls for an audit of the Memphis Police crime report by saying the efforts of the agency shouldn’t be doubted, nor should the National Guard occupy Memphis.
“The barometer’s going in the right direction,” Chism told the Lookout Thursday, referring to the same crime report as Lee. “I’m afraid that if you bring in troops that know nothing about the city or people in it, the unintended consequences would be people being harassed or detained for no reason other than misinformation.”
Trump ordered the California National Guard to Los Angeles this summer in response to protests over his immigration deportation policies, then sent in Marines. Gov. Gavin Newsom sued Trump, and one court ruled the president broke the law.










I’m afraid that if you bring in troops that know nothing about the city or people in it, the unintended consequences would be people being harassed or detained for no reason other than misinformation.


– Rep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis


In Tennessee’s case, Republican leaders are more willing to side with the president. 
Sexton didn’t appear quite as enthused about putting troops on the streets of Nashville, which he said isn’t in the White House conversation for deployment.
Still, because of Trump’s concerns about cracking down on crime, he cautioned local government leaders to focus on law enforcement to protect residents and tourists.
Gee whiz, every time I’ve ever been on Lower Broad, police are everywhere. What would soldiers do that’s not being done now? Escort bachelorette parties?
Who’s really to blame
Silicon Ranch’s Matt Beasley was sitting on the front row at an Aug. 18 Future Farmers of America breakfast when he got the bad news: The solar industry is destroying Tennessee’s farmland.
Those weren’t the specific words he heard from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, but they’re close. Rollins told a crowd of hundreds at the Wilson County Fairgrounds that the federal government, in a “misguided ideological vision,” became an “abettor of farmland destruction.”
“That’s exactly what is happening with the removal of farmland from production so that thousands of fields of solar panels can be built upon them,” Rollins said.
Beasley said he immediately started receiving text messages that morning from lawmakers and Farm Bureau people. 
“All these groups were saying, ‘Are you here?’ Nobody expected it, and I certainly didn’t,” Beasley told the Lookout.

As part of her missive, Rollins introduced a Trump administration policy rolling back part of the Biden New Green Deal, ending all USDA subsidies for solar operations that take prime farmland out of production. Rollins justified the policy with the claim that Tennessee lost 1.2 million acres in the last 30 years and that by 2027 some 2 million acres of Tennessee farmland will be lost. She failed to mention, though, that solar panels account for only a minute part of that.
“It’s a complete red herring,” Beasley said of her statements.
In fact, an independent state study found that solar facilities are not the primary contributor to farmland loss. Residential and business development are the main culprits.
Additionally, the Tennessee Valley Authority set a goal of obtaining 10,000 megawatts annually from solar energy by 2035. If all of that power source came from Tennessee, one of seven TVA states, it would still take less than 1% of the state’s farmland, Beasley said.
Granted, solar panels aren’t exactly the most beautiful sight. People would much rather see a field of grazing cattle.
Those same people who moved into a new neighborhood built on the land of a deceased farmer don’t want anyone else building across the road, either. 
But since former Gov. Phil Bredesen, his sidekick Matt Kisber and Reagan Farr founded Silicon Ranch in 2011, they’ve taken a new turn toward ag production.
Using what is called agrivoltaics, the company raises sheep on some of its solar ranches. The animals don’t bother the panels, and they keep the grass down and fertilize the land.










It’s a complete red herring. 


– Matt Beasley, Silicon Ranch, of Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins' claim the solar industry is destroying farmland 


“If you deploy agrivoltaics, you’re still generating agricultural production on that land. It’s not being taken away, it’s being added to,” Beasley said.
The Trump administration’s dislike for solar energy is bound to hurt the diversification of power, but solar-related companies are moving ahead regardless.
Highland Materials, which makes polysilicon materials for solar panels, is set to build a plant in Hawkins County after receiving funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. It expects to produce 20,000 metric tons of the material at peak operation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association reports the industry installed nearly 18 gigawatts of new capacity in the first half of 2025, accounting for 82% of all new power, despite Trump’s policies. Yet the industry is in danger of losing 44 gigawatts of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline.
Oddly enough, the group’s report found that 77% of solar capacity installed this year took place in states won by Trump, Republican strongholds such as Texas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas. (That’s almost the Southeastern Conference)
That statistic could show that people support a stronger power grid but remain likely to accept political rhetoric that has little basis in fact.

Is this grounds for …
The federal judge handling the corruption trial of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, made a bit of a faux pas during a phone hearing this week.
U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson repeatedly referred Cynthia Sherwood, the attorney for Cothren, as “Ms. Cothren.” It’s not clear how many other people besides a Lookout reporter caught the mistake.
But after a short break in the proceedings, Sherwood raised the matter with the judge and added that she knew he knew her name.
Richardson apologized and said he was so focused on Cothren’s issues that he misspoke. “It matters a lot to him and the government as well,” Richardson said.
The question remains, though: With attorneys for Casada and Cothren pulling out all the stops, could this be grounds for a mistrial?

The state released the results of the tour on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (West Virginia Department of Human Services photo)The state released the results of its foster care “listening tour,” and the findings reiterated many problems already well-known in West Virginia’s troubled system — like the need for expanded access to child mental health care and improved communication with families and caregivers.
“Nearly everyone described a culture more focused on blame than solving problems,” the report said. 
The West Virginia Department of Human Services paid $348,000 for Chicago-based Guidehouse advisory firm to facilitate the meetings and produce the report, which was released Wednesday. Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who wants to fix foster care, signed off on an emergency spending request for the project. 
The report follows eight in-person sessions and 11 virtual meetings where DoHS and the consulting firm brought together foster parents, biological parents, social workers, legal professionals and more to share concerns and solutions for West Virginia foster care.
“Foster parents and kinship caregivers said they feared losing placements for raising concerns,” the report said. “Biological parents echoed this — sharing experiences of how questioning decisions have triggered delays or stricter oversight. This fear silences feedback, hinders transparency, and deepens power imbalances.”
DoHS Bureau for Social Services Commissioner Lorie Bragg said in a news release that the report reflects challenges as well as opportunities for change. 
“We are taking the stories, concerns and solutions we heard and using them to guide next steps in policy, practice and training. We remain committed to ensuring this process stays collaborative and transparent,” she said. 
There are more than 6,000 children in the state’s foster care system, and West Virginia far outpaces other states in the number of children coming into care. 
Hundreds of West Virginians shared their experiences and ideas to improve the state’s foster care system during the listening tour, DoHS said.
According to the report, families and youth in West Virginia foster care “experience a revolving door of caseworkers and [guardian ad litems] — some reporting four or more in a single case.”
“Turnover, burnout and vacancies create chaos, forcing parents, youth, judges and caregivers to re-explain, re-engage and rebuild trust with each other from scratch,” the report said. 
The state’s courts system, overwhelmed by child abuse and neglect cases, is struggling to keep up with the case load. During foster care listening sessions, parents and caregivers shared that their hearings had been delayed for months or even years. 
There’s also a need to create consistency across the state in how child welfare cases are handled by courts and Child Protective Services workers. 
“A striking theme was the uneven experience between different counties and workers. Many participants perceived that the ‘same case’ could play out differently depending on the judge, the worker, or the region — with uneven application of timelines, visitation, reunification standards and basic case procedures,” the report said.
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer has already said improving consistency and implementing processes was one of his major focuses for child welfare.
The report also noted that the state needs to expand access to mental health and wraparound services as the state is woefully short on providers who can help children dealing with trauma-induced behavioral issues. The shortage of child mental health providers and in-state treatment beds has led the state to send foster children to out-of-state facilities.
A news release from DoHS outlined next steps, saying the department will convene a stakeholder advisory committee. They plan to use the report’s findings “to shape workforce initiatives, strengthen prevention efforts and enhance support for children and families.”
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
“Releasing this report is more than just documenting what we heard, it is a commitment to act,” Mayer said. “The voices of families, caregivers and caseworkers will help shape policy and practice changes that move us toward a stronger, more supportive child welfare system.”
The report suggested that the state could end its reliance on out-of-state placements by expanding in-state therapeutic options and recruiting more specialized homes.
Earlier this week, Mayer told lawmakers at the state Capitol that there were around 600 foster children living in out-of-state group homes. Eighteen children were living in a hotel as of Monday.
“These children are not staying in hotels because we don’t have enough beds, because we don’t have enough foster parents. It’s a lot to do with the complexities and the challenges that these children are facing,” he said. “And you know, we’ve been working and continue to work with our providers to better understand the needs of these children, and how we can help them boost their capacity and their ability to support these youth.”
Last year, the state spent nearly $70 million paying to house foster children in out-of-state facilities. DoHS is considering the possibility of how they could build in-state facilities to serve these children who often need specialized behavioral care.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young was told earlier this week that Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and President Donald Trump “were considering deploying the National Guard and other resources to Memphis,” Young said in a written statement, officially confirming rumors that have spread across Memphis.
The confirmation that Trump has considered deployment to Memphis comes after the president threatened to send military forces to other Democrat-led cities, a move that some legal and military leaders have raised concerns as threatening democracy and possibly disregarding state laws.
This month, a federal judge in California ruled that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer was illegal. In Washington, D.C., the district’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit to stop the deployment of the National Guard troops, calling it “illegal.”

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris described his concerns about these deployments in a statement on Facebook Thursday, saying, “I’ve been to countries where there isn’t freedom but there is military presence, where you can’t protest, and officials stay in power for as long as they want. That’s not America. Sadly, with the occupation of US cities, we are far down this road of losing our democracy.”
Harris did not directly mention the plans for Memphis in his post.
It’s unclear now whether or when the National Guard will be deployed to Memphis, but a source familiar with Young’s conversations told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism that it is likely to occur in the next two to four weeks.
 Young says financial resources, patrol officers needed

In his written statement, Young said he is “committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress.”
And despite the concerns about the erosion of democracy, Young framed his response around crime, which Trump has used to argue for these deployments.






“We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships. What we need most are financial resources for intervention and prevention, additional patrol officers, and case support to strengthen MPD’s investigations,” he said. “Memphis is already making measurable progress in bringing down crime, and we support initiatives that help accelerate the pace of the work our officers, community partners, and residents are doing every day.”
Earlier this week, the Memphis Police Department touted historic crime reductions, reporting decreases across all major categories in the first eight months of 2025.
Some of Tennessee’s congressional Republicans — including U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles and U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger — have called for the national guard to be deployed in Memphis and Nashville. In a letter to Lee sent Wednesday, State Rep. Torrey Harris blasted the idea that Memphis is a dangerous city that requires “intimidation by military force.”










We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships.


– Memphis Mayor Paul Young


“The idea that a federal figure would even threaten to deploy armed troops into our neighborhoods is nothing short of horrific. It is a slap in the face to our democracy, our state sovereignty, and to the very residents who already struggle daily against systemic disinvestment,” he wrote.
Tennessee Code addresses the governor’s power to order the National Guard into active service. That power comes “in case of invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, attack, or combination” and  “not to exceed the duration of the emergency for which they may be called.”
Alternately, the governing body of a city or county — in this case the Memphis City Council or Shelby County Board of Commissioners — can request by resolution that the governor call on the National Guard if “there is a breakdown of law and order, a grievous breach of the peace, a riot, resistance to process of this state, or disaster, or imminent danger thereof.”
Keedran Franklin, a small business owner and professional organizer, said he spoke with Young on Wednesday and that Young told him he doesn’t want the National Guard to come to Memphis, and that he’d asked Lee to hold off on sending them.
Franklin said the deployment of the National Guard to Memphis could cause “some type of chaos and panic.”
“What happens here is they start federalizing the police departments even more, start federalizing these local agencies even more. People’s charges will start being federal more,” Franklin said. “It’s dangerous for us, but I think it’s time for everybody to say something, to stand with each other.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/200531-FloydProtest-0920-scaled.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

Van Orden's social media posts following the assassination of Charlie Kirk blame Democrat and journalists and predict 'civil war.'| (Screenshot via Zoom)Fruitless thoughts and prayers. Familiar calls for de-escalating toxic partisanship. Promises to do something about the teen mental health crisis, violent video games, the epidemic of alienation and hopelessness. By now we are all accustomed to the ritual reactions to routine incidents of horrific gun violence that plague our country like no other wealthy nation on Earth, where firearms are the leading cause of death for children.
But if the usual, feckless responses to gun violence are maddening in a country that can’t get its act together to pass even marginal, commonsense gun safety measures, the reaction of Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden to the hideous assassination of rightwing provocateur Charlie Kirk this week was downright reprehensible.
As soon as the news broke that Kirk was shot while on stage at Utah Valley University, Van Orden began a stream of increasingly unhinged social media posts blaming Democrats and the media for the murder and declaring “the gloves are off.”
“The leftwing political violence must stop now,” Van Orden tweeted. In another post he wrote, “The left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. And they want it. Just like the democrat party wanted our 1st civil war.”
Contrast that with the statements from other Wisconsin politicians. 
Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said, “there is no two ways about this: political violence has no place in America. I am keeping Charlie and his family in my thoughts in this truly horrifying moment.”
Van Orden’s fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied said, “There is absolutely zero place for political violence in our country.” 
“Violence against anyone because of their political beliefs is wrong. Violence against others is wrong,”  Gov. Tony Evers said. “Violence is never the answer for resolving our differences or disagreements. Wisconsin joins in praying for Charlie Kirk and the Utah Valley community and first responders.”
None of those statements mollified Van Orden, who told reporters in the U.S. Capitol that “every one of you” is responsible for Kirk’s death.
Reposting a news clip of Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who called for the nation to de-escalate political violence and come together, Van Orden wrote, “Too late. You have sown the wind.”
“I am not sure they understand what they have done,” Van Orden ranted. “They missed in Butler, but it is on now.” 
Never mind that in Butler, Pennsylvania, the would-be assassin who targeted President Donald Trump was a registered Republican. Or that, as Van Orden spewed accusations against Democrats and journalists, the identity of the shooter who targeted Charlie Kirk was still unknown. When a reporter pointed that out to Van Orden, he replied, “You know what? Knock it off.”
Actually, it’s Van Orden who needs to knock it off.
Seizing on political violence to try to stoke more political violence is as dangerous as it is disgusting.
Far from recognizing the human tragedy for all of us as our country descends into this nightmare, Van Orden capitalizes on murder, whether the victims are liberals or conservatives, imposing the same crude narrative about a war with violent leftists every time.
After the horrible double murder of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, Van Orden falsely characterized the suspected shooter, a right-wing religious fanatic whose list of intended targets included Democrats and abortion providers, as an anti-Trump protester who “decided to murder and attempt to murder some politicians that were not far Left enough for them.” 
He seems to revel in the prospect of more violence. Unfortunately, his tone is matched by Trump, who issued his own threatening statement, politicizing the attack and claiming that it is part of a pattern of leftwing attacks on conservatives. “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” Trump said. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence.”
Of course, it is Trump who has a long history of inviting political violence against Democrats and members of the press. Van Orden is copying him by escalating that rhetoric in Wisconsin. 
Online, Van Orden’s belligerent posts got mixed reviews. Some people demanded that he explain what he means when he says “the gloves are off,” condemning him for encouraging hooliganism. “So you plan on using this to start Civil War II?” one person posted. “You don’t think things through before you say them.
You people fantasize about killing your fellow Americans like it’s a full-time job.”
Others celebrated his statements. “No other way to fix it at this point,” one of Van Orden’s followers replied to his post. “We need a 2-3 day national purge. We do business with whatever is left of the left.” Appended to the comment was a GIF celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse for shooting Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha.
It’s unlikely that Van Orden, who has been unwilling to face his own constituents at an in-person town hall will actually lead the violent attacks against his fellow Americans he fantasizes about online. But feeding that violent fantasy is clearly inspiring for some people. And that’s exactly why it’s got to stop.

The report examines the nationwide housing affordability crisis impacting workers across all income levels. The authors cite “decades of underbuilding, rising interest rates, and wage stagnation” for pushing homeownership and rental housing further out of reach for many workers. It used its Paycheck to Paycheck database to track affordability changes in 390 metropolitan statistical areas from 2019 to 2024. The authors shared case studies from Asheville, Boise, Idaho, Houston, Tampa, Florida and Seattle.

“These findings underscore the depth and breadth of the housing crisis, which is increasingly pricing out working families across the country—regardless of geography or profession,” said David M. Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference. “The housing affordability crisis is now hitting families in every metro area, for nearly every occupation.”
Here are findings from the other four case studies:

Boise, Idaho: Home prices increased by over 60% in just five years. A middle school staff saw teachers, librarians, and counselors priced out of two-bedroom rental units by 2023, with librarians still unable to afford rent in 2024.
Houston: Despite high rates of homebuilding, only 28 of 286 occupations can afford to purchase a home with 10% down in 2024. Order Clerks and Customer Service Representatives cannot afford even a one-bedroom rental.
Seattle: Not a single occupation tracked could afford to buy a home in 2024, including Dentists earning over $200,000. Only 50 out of 285 occupations can afford a two-bedroom rental.
Tampa, Florida: Only 11 of 284 occupations can afford to buy a home. Legal Assistants, earning $62,420, cannot afford rent for a one-bedroom apartment.

“This is no longer a problem we can frame as affecting only certain groups or regions. From big cities to small towns, Americans who work hard, earn solid incomes, and contribute to their communities are finding that neither renting nor buying is within reach,” Dworkin said. “If we don’t address the supply shortage, reform zoning, and invest in housing at all income levels, we are facing a fundamental threat to the health and sustainability of our economy.”
The study found that beginning with a notable spike from 2019-2020, fairly-priced rents for one-bedroom apartments in Asheville increased 30% and 26% for two bedroom apartment. The $59,840 needed to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the city in 2024 represented a nearly $28,000 increase over the salary needed to do so in 2019. The $67,200 annual salary needed to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Asheville is a $27,000 increase from 2019 costs.
A typical construction site has about 13 occupations ranging from architectural and civil drafters and architectural and engineering managers to helpers for electricians, carpenters and plumbers, according to the report.
In 2019, three  — construction laborers, electrician helpers and roofer — of the 13 occupations in Asheville could not afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment, according to the report. By 2024, the authors found that five additional occupations earned less than the $59,840 to needed to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the city.
Across  269 occupations tracked in Asheville in 2024, only 66 could afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment. Fewer than half could — 97 — could afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment.
Meanwhile, to afford a typical home in the Asheville metropolitan statistical area, the authors found a buyer needed more than double the income necessary five years ago. With a 10% downpayment, a buyer needed to earn $70,678 in 2019. By 2024, a buyer needed to earn $143,507 a year to purchase the same home.
Of the 390 metropolitan statistical areas sampled, 176 require a six-figure salary to purchase a home with only 10% down. One-hundred and fifty of them are outside of California, a state where home prices are typically higher and 64 are in non coastal communities. Another 150 metropolitan statistical areas require incomes between $75,000 and $99,999 to purchase a home. In 2019 only 30 of those metropolitan statistical areas required a six-figure income to purchase a home with a 10% downpayment and 43 required income between $75,000 and $99,999.
“In five short years homeownership became unattainable for thousands of combinations of MSAs [metropolitan statistical areas] and occupations from insurance sales agents in Akron, Ohio, to electrical power line Installers and repairers in Worcester, Massachusetts,” the authors wrote. “Renting a modest two-bedroom apartment became unaffordable for many others, including public safety telecommunicators in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and news analysts, reporters, and journalists in Wichita, Kansas.”  
Here are more findings from the report:

Homeownership Costs Have Surged: In 125 MSAs, the income needed to purchase has doubled or more since 2019.
Renting Is Increasingly Unaffordable: Nearly half (47%) of tracked occupations cannot afford a two-bedroom apartment, compared to 38% in 2019. In 32 MSAs, the salary needed to comfortably rent exceeds $75,000.
Wages Lag Far Behind Costs: Even traditionally high-earning professionals are losing housing access. In Seattle, dentists cannot afford to buy a typically priced home; in Asheville, civil engineers are priced out despite earning nearly $100,000.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4799-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

(Photo courtesy of John Dekhane)During World War II, tyranny and destruction swept over continents, and the very foundations of our freedom stood in peril. In the face of such danger, communities across Idaho didn’t hesitate.
From the shores of Lake Coeur d’Alene to the quiet streets of Boise, men and women from every corner of the state stepped forward and answered the call to serve their beloved country. They asked for no recognition or reward, yet history will forever remember them as heroes.
Among the courageous men who left Idaho but never came home was Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres.
Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres
Born on April 26, 1919, in Eagle, Idaho, Audrey was the cherished son of Charles Rufus and Mabel Edith Ayres. He grew up in the Boise area with his sisters, and was raised with the values of integrity, hard work, and selflessness. Audrey was known for his kind spirit and gentle nature — qualities that earned him the affection and admiration of all who knew him.
At the age of 18, Audrey decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy, where he served four years aboard the battleship USS Idaho. Life at sea demanded focus, discipline, and strength, and despite his young age, Audrey embraced it with commitment and resolve. Year after year, he came to embody the true meaning of loyalty, responsibility, and honor, as he proudly fulfilled his duties at sea.
After his honorable discharge in June 1941 — just months before America entered World War II — Audrey made another remarkable decision. Though he had already served at sea, he felt a profound calling to defend the ideals he believed in. Determined to confront the forces of tyranny in the skies, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and underwent rigorous training.
Guided by the values instilled in him in Idaho, Audrey became a wireless operator and air gunner with 429 Squadron, flying aboard Halifax bombers. Mission after mission, he flew over enemy-held territory, risking his life for a cause greater than himself.
On Jan. 20, 1944, Audrey and his crewmates took off from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, England, on a mission to destroy military targets in Berlin. During the raid, their aircraft was struck by enemy fire and crashed, killing him instantly. On that fateful day, the man who had served at sea and fought in the skies was taken from the world. Audrey was only 24 years old, with so much life ahead, and so much yet to live.
The news of Audrey’s death sent shockwaves through the entire Boise community, leaving his family, friends, and neighbors utterly heartbroken. His parents carried the pain of his loss to their graves — Mabel passing in 1949 and Charles in 1976 — forever marked by the sorrow of losing their son. Audrey’s sisters, who had grown up alongside him in Idaho, held his memory close throughout their long lives, cherishing the bond they shared with a brother taken far too soon.

Audrey was initially buried near the crash site in Germany, but after the war, his remains were transferred to the Berlin 1939–1945 War Cemetery in western Berlin, where he lies among thousands of fellow Commonwealth heroes who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom. Back home, a memorial marker was installed at Star Cemetery in Star, where his loved ones could come to mourn, to cry, to reflect, and to feel close to Audrey. That place became a sacred space — a symbol of love, loss, and eternal remembrance.
It is our solemn duty to commemorate Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres and to honor a legacy carved through sacrifice, devotion, and bravery. His story echoes those of countless heroes from Idaho who left their homes, families, and dreams behind to help turn the tide of war in humanity’s darkest hour.
Though their voices were silenced by an unforgiving war, their spirit remains woven into the fabric of Idaho — and their memory will endure, so long as we choose to carry their story forward.

Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, presents Senate Bill 4, an act relating to sick leave for members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, during a meeting of the Senate State and Local Government Committee. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A longtime Republican lawmaker who will not seek reelection next year still has a few policies he wants to check off before leaving office. 
In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, 72, said he’s happy to leave at a career peak in his time as a lawmaker, but he has a few transportation priorities he wants to address during his final legislative session in 2026. 
Announcing his decision to not seek reelection last week, Higdon said spending more time with his family was a key factor in his decision. The Lebanon Republican told the Lantern that he anticipates quality candidates will run for the 14th Senate District seat, which represents LaRue, Marion, Nelson, Spencer and Washington counties. Higdon was elected to the Senate in 2009. Before that, he was in the House beginning in 2003.
“I think part of leadership is knowing when to say when and to pass the torch,” Higdon said. “I’ve seen too many of my colleagues stay too long, and I don’t want to be that guy.”
Higdon is the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, which often debates infrastructure projects across Kentucky. During his last session, he hopes to introduce a comprehensive bill that would “modernize Kentucky’s transportation system.” Higdon said issues he wants to address include changing the state’s fuel formula tax and introducing a user fee for commercial electric vehicles. 
Separate from that, Higdon is passionate about reducing distracted driving in Kentucky. Texting while driving already is illegal in Kentucky. The legislation he has in mind would go beyond that. Higdon has worked on iterations of the legislation in the past, but they haven’t made it through the General Assembly. A bill he co-sponsored this year would have prohibited drivers from using personal communication devices in ways that require the driver to reach for the device or press more than one button to activate it. 
Whenever Higdon sees a report of a car accident, he said he asks himself if it could have been prevented with such a law. 
He anticipates some pushback, particularly by those who would argue the bill would create a “nanny state,” but he wants to trudge on. 
“Driving is not a right, it’s a privilege and we need to keep our roads safe,” Higdon said.

Another transportation issue that has made headlines over the summer are Kentucky’s regional driver’s licensing offices, which the legislature created in 2020 to replace offices in each county. Earlier this year, the Transportation Cabinet revoked 1,985 driver’s licenses because of irregularities. A whistleblower alleges that workers in a regional office in Louisville were supplying driver’s licenses to immigrants who were not eligible to receive them in exchange for $200.
Higdon said he is helping another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Aaron Reed of Shelbyville, craft legislation. Higdon added that he supports local offices having the ability to oversee some processes, like issuing renewal licenses and permit testing to eliminate lines at regional offices and save people in rural communities a long commute to run an errand. 
“We know there needs to be something done. It’s probably not going to be a full overhaul. I think we would go back to square one, and we’re just not ready for that right now,” Higdon said. “It needs to be well thought out, well planned.”
Higdon’s committee also often discusses recovery and repairs following natural disasters. In recent years, Kentucky has been the site of devastating tornadoes and floods that have caused damage to roads, bridges and other structures. 
Kentucky has “plenty experience” with disasters, Higdon said, adding that lawmakers have set aside extra funding in the state budget to address any unforeseen circumstances. He also commended the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s response under Secretary Jim Gray. 
At the national level, FEMA has come under scrutiny as President Donald Trump has floated the idea of dismantling the federal agency and moving its responsibilities back to the states. 
Higdon said that he agrees with the idea that states’ emergency response teams can oversee immediate response as local teams often know communities better. However, he does think that states need federal funding to help rebuild after disasters. 
“We need that money from the federal government, too, for that recovery and that type of help,” Higdon added. 
Higdon has also made headway with Republicans on pension policies in the last few years. He is a co-chair of the Public Pension Oversight Board. He said his biggest accomplishment was getting leaders, staff and the General Assembly to more thoroughly vet and analyze the impact on the state budget before approving changes to public pensions —  “to understand and to have policies in place that we don’t do shortcuts on pensions.” Higdon argued that shortcuts  in the past led to problems now. 
Some of those policies include having the legislation fully go through the process. Also any pension bill must be vetted by the oversight board and have an actuarial analysis. 
‘A friend’
Higdon’s colleagues in the Senate noted his friendship and willingness to listen. In a statement about Higdon’s decision to not seek reelection, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers called Higdon a “a trusted colleague and a steady hand in the Senate.” 
“Most of all, he’s been a friend. His leadership on transportation, pensions, judicial matters, veterans’ issues, and numerous other areas has made an undeniable difference for Kentucky, and he will leave a lasting legislative legacy deeply woven into the fabric of this commonwealth,” Stivers said. 
Across the aisle, Louisville Democratic Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong said she has always enjoyed working with Higdon and appreciated him discussing how decisions about transportation projects are made during her first year in office. She is a new member of the transportation committee. 
“I do think he does a really good job of listening to members about what the needs are in their community and being fair about how he is allocating resources to different types of projects,” Chambers Armstrong added. 
Higdon said he found mentoring newcomers to the legislature enjoyable and that they were often grateful for the help. He encouraged his colleagues to do that after he leaves office. 
He also had some parting advice for fellow Republicans: “Just do the right thing for the right reasons, and the rest of it will take care of itself.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/higdon020724-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)Virginia has outpaced the national average in Medicaid spending, an analysis of data by groups of pharmacists found. The state agency that oversees Medicaid benefits have countered that the group’s report is based on “inaccurate” data that it is working to correct.
Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency and Strategic DirectionsRX conducted an analysis of state Medicaid prescription drug spending between 2017 and 2023. It found that Virginia has spent between $1,000 more to $1 million more than the national average in recent years. 
Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), contracts with Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) to manage the benefits of Medicaid enrollees. The MCOs then contract with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). The PBMs act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs also retain rebates and discounts from contracts but some consumers and pharmacies have said they are unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. 
That question often stems from the fact that some MCOs and PBMs are vertically integrated — meaning that they’re part of a larger company that owns health care facilities, pharmacies or health systems. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced this week that his office is investigating some entities to ensure that insulin prices, a critical drug for managing diabetes, was not artificially inflated in violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. 
Miyares’ office investigating pharmacy benefit managers, manufacturers over insulin prices

This year, lawmakers also passed legislation to create a single state-contracted PBM to handle Medicaid in Virginia and Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed it. 
The goal, supporters said, is to increase transparency, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. Virginia’s next gubernatorial administration will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of that law. The PBM reform law was one of the proposed solutions outlined in the pharmacists’ report, and one of its authors supported the bill during this year’s legislative session. 
“When (rebates) gets passed around through companies that have multiple arms that manage multiple parts of the flow of this money, that’s when you start seeing prices go way up,” said Jeremy Counts, a Blacksburg-area pharmacist who worked on the analysis for the report. 
The new report indicates that Virginia’s Medicaid prescription drug plans are returning 20% of gross drug spending back to Medicaid through manufacturer rebates. The national average is about 68%, for comparison, the report read. 
“The state is being charged a very high price for generic medications,” Counts added. 
By “moving to a system that isn’t controlled by the MCOs and their PBMs” the state can set different reimbursement rates, he said. Counts also suggested this could help take burdens off pharmacies, which have experienced more closures. 
The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, is a national benchmark for prescription drug prices – both generic and brand-name — and is developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This represents the average price pharmacies pay for drugs from wholesalers and is a national standard other payers use to set reimbursement rates. 
The math of the solution, Counts explained on a call, is to calculate the NADAC rate of a drug plus whatever the state’s dispensing fee is. Even without the PBM reform bill, he suggested that DMAS could order MCOs to rework their NADAC models. 
“That makes your pharmacies break even,” Counts said. 
 DMAS reporting errors

In light of Counts’ revelations, DMAS said Thursday that he had worked with data that stemmed from an error the agency is already working on correcting. The agency said they alerted Counts about the incorrect data “prior to him publishing the analysis.” 
In a statement to The Mercury, DMAS shared that the department is working to correct the data and resubmit it “as soon as possible” and that it is undertaking a General Assembly-directed study of its pharmacy delivery system.
DMAS also shared a letter it recently wrote to Counts where Virginia Health and Human Services secretary Janet Kelly noted an error that caused DMAS to “significantly overreport pharmacy spending to CMS beginning in 2019.”
It was flagged by Dels. Kieth Hodges, R-Middlesex and Otto Wachsmann, R-Brunswick — both of whom have pharmacy backgrounds. Though Counts’ report was already complete by Sep. 4, this is when DMAS informed him that he’d worked with numbers they are working to fix. 
“DMAS is actively working to rectify the reporting error and agency leadership has offered to provide the corrected information to Pharmacists United for Truth & Transparency as soon as it is verified and available,” Kelly wrote. 
Counts said the organizations “stand by our report” but that they “remain committed to working with Secretary Kelly and DMAS.” 
“We hope to hear from her office soon so we may continue to work cooperatively for the betterment of Commonwealth citizens,” Counts wrote on behalf of the organizations.

On Sept. 16, 1663, the Virginia General Assembly passed Act XIV, establishing Sept. 13 as a perpetual holiday to commemorate the suppression of the Gloucester Conspiracy. Although this holiday was soon forgotten, it is worth considering its reinstatement, for reasons that differ significantly from those originally intended.
The Gloucester Conspiracy, also known as the Servant’s Plot or the Poropotank Servant’s Revolt, is one of the earliest and most significant uprisings involving enslaved individuals and indentured servants in colonial Virginia. This event culminated in several arrests for treason, and the execution and beheading of four individuals.
This plot followed only two years after the York County Conspiracy of 1661, where 40 servants conspired to revolt under their enslaver, Maj. James Goodwin. Although quickly suppressed with no arrests, the York conspiracy demonstrated the growing discontent among Virginia’s indentured labor force and prompted the General Assembly to pass two acts mandating better treatment of servants and the enslaved.
The Gloucester plot comprised a diverse group of English, Irish, African, and Indian indentured servants and enslaved people, even convict laborers transported from British jails, making it one of the first instances of multi-ethnic collaboration in colonial resistance.
The conspiracy transpired on Sept. 1, 1663, when John Gunter, William Bell, Richard Darbishire, John Hayte, Thomas Jones, William Ball, William Poultey, William Bendell, and Thomas Collins secretly met at Peter Knight’s home near Cooks Quarter. The conspirators appointed Bell and Gunter as their leaders. The group agreed to reconvene at midnight the following Sunday, Sept. 6, at Poplar Spring, with each participant ordered to bring whatever weapons they could beg, scavenge or steal for the uprising.
The plan was to march from Poplar Spring first to the home of Lt. Colonel Francis Willis, a member of the governor’s council. There they intended to seize more weapons and demand their release from indentures. A potential second destination was the Green Spring home of Gov. William Berkeley, where they would demand that all indentured servants who were normally required to serve seven years of indenture be released after one year. Many wanted to kill Beverley and Willis if they refused to cooperate.
As with many colonial-era insurrections, such as Gabriel’s Rebellion, an infiltrator betrayed the Gloucester plot. John Birkenhead, a servant of Maj. John Smith, revealed the plan to  Berkeley, who arranged for the conspirators to be ambushed during their gathering at Poplar Spring. Citing divine intervention, the governor said it was “God’s hands” that had delivered “so transcendent a favour as the preserving all we have from so utter ruin.”
With the plot foiled, the nine captured conspirators faced trial for high treason before the General Court in Williamsburg, marking the first time colonial authorities treated servant rebellion as an act of war rather than merely a labor dispute. Determined to make examples of the servants, the court accused them of attempting “utterly to deprive, depose, cast downe and disinherite” the governor. Additionally, the conspirators were charged with planning to wage war against Virginia to “wholy submit and destroy” the still fledgling colony.
The harsh sentences reflected the court’s determination to send a simple but definitive message about the consequences of insurrection. Robert Beverley Jr. wrote in 1705 that four of the nine convicted conspirators—Bell, Gunter, and two unnamed—were executed by hanging. In addition, some historical accounts note that “several bloody heads dangled from local chimney tops as a gruesome warning to others.”
For his betrayal, Birkenhead gained his freedom from indentured servitude and received 5,000 pounds of tobacco, a substantial amount that represented years of earnings for most colonists.
The General Assembly thus voted to make Sept. 13 (presumably the day the final depositions were taken) a perpetual holiday: “Resolved that the 13th of September be annually kept holy, being the day those villains intended to put the plot in execution.” Also, in 1670,  Berkeley issued an order prohibiting Britain’s worst criminals from being imported to Virginia, citing “the horror yet remaining amongst us of the barbourous designe of such villaines in September 1663.”
Virginia should reassess the historical significance of Sept. 13 by reclaiming the date not as a commemoration of colonial authority’s suppression of rebellion, but as a day to honor the resistance, courage, and aspirations of those who, despite overwhelming odds, sought to break free from bondage and assert their humanity. Honoring these individuals would affirm the state’s commitment to a more inclusive and truthful telling of its history.

(Photo by Susan Tebben, Ohio Capital Journal.)With the introduction of a Democratic-proposed map and the announcement of a bipartisan committee on the subject, Ohio lawmakers have officially begun the process of congressional redistricting. So what happens now?
Ohio is restarting its congressional redistricting process, not because of any special push from leadership or even a response to a spontaneous redraw.
Ohio is making a new congressional map because they are legally bound to, as a consequence of a lack of bipartisan agreement in 2022, the last time congressional maps were adopted in the state.
To have maps for the 2026 election, the legislature is starting again.
How redistricting works
Redistricting has been a topic of conversation in Ohio for many years. In 2020, the U.S. Census conducted its official population survey, a landmark time when redistricting happens across the country.
The number of districts that are drawn for both state legislative districts and congressional ones are based on the population shifts recorded in the census conducted every 10 years.
The political leanings of those districts is in theory supposed to come from the voting trends of the state and country.
The GOP-created congressional districts approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission on March 2, 2022.
Congressional district mapmakers often look to the most recent presidential elections for help in how those districts should be shaped.
Republicans currently control 10 of 15 of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional district seats, or 66%. Ohio voted for President Trump in 2024 with 55% of the vote.
The Republican majority that leads the legislature has argued that the 66% Republican majority that was adopted in the March 2022 congressional map represents the political makeup of the state.
Amid a national gerrymandering frenzy, prominent Republicans have called for the party to take two or three more seats. Meanwhile, Ohio Democrats have proposed a map that would lean eight seats Republican to seven seats Democratic, a 53-47 split.
The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, a national analysis of all redistricting efforts, gave the current 10-5 split map an overall “D” grade, with its lowest marks given in partisan fairness.
Democrats unsurprisingly disagreed that the map aligned with the views of the voters, and have maintained that disagreement through their new map proposal introduced on Tuesday.
What the Ohio Constitution says
The district redrawing process is laid out in an amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018 with nearly 75% support, which spells out not only deadlines for the process, but also how the maps should look once the lines are drawn.
The drawing of congressional districts and legislative districts has certain standards, but some “mandatory standards” for statehouse districts are “general standards” for congressional districts, according to a legislative brief on the process.
For congressional districts, the general standards for a map include contiguity, or districts with “a single, unbroken shape, with no ‘islands’ of territory that do not touch the rest of the district.”
The districts should also be compact and keep counties, townships and municipal corporations whole as much as possible.
“Splitting a political subdivision is necessary when, for example, its population exceeds the ideal district population,” the Legislative Service Commission wrote in its analysis of the redistricting process.
Next steps and deadlines
A joint committee on congressional redistricting has announced they will meet for the first time on Sept. 22. A time and location has not been announced by legislative leadership.
The legislature has until Sept. 30 to approve a congressional map following the constitutional rules. That map must have approval of three-fifths of both chambers of the legislature, including at least half the Democrats.

During consideration of the map proposals by the legislature, proposals are assigned bill numbers, and a committee will hold public hearings on the bills before they can be sent to the full chamber for a vote.
Advocates across the state are hoping the General Assembly will keep to the constitution in holding a transparent process that allows the public time to review maps before they’re voted on, and provide public input.
“You don’t get a fair map without a fair process,” said Bria Bennett, a spokesperson for the Equal Districts Coalition, in a statement. “Closed-door drafting, limits on public testimony and ignored constitutional criteria are not routine politics; they’re power grabs that cheat Ohio voters out of fair representation in Congress.”
Without bipartisan approval, the legislature can’t pass a map, and if the deadline passes without agreement, the process moves on to the Ohio Redistricting Commission.
The seven-person commission is made up of mostly majority party members, as dictated by the redistricting constitutional amendment.
The Senate president, House speaker, Senate minority leader, and House minority leader can all choose to serve on the commission or appoint another member of their chamber to serve.
The governor, auditor, and secretary of state are all required to be on the commission.
With the current make-up of statewide officeholders, this means the Ohio Redistricting Commission has a 5-2, Republican-to-Democratic split.
Public hearings should be held by the commission as well on any proposed maps, before their deadline of Oct. 31.
The rules state the group must also come up with bipartisan support to adopt a new map.
A lack of agreement in the commission means the process goes back to the legislature, who has a final deadline of Nov. 30 to come up with a congressional map.
This time, while the legislature has to follow specific constitutional rules to do so, the legislature can pass a map with a simple majority, rather than the 66% needed in the original attempt.
In order to pass a map with a simple majority, the congressional districts “must not unduly favor or disfavor a political party or its incumbents,” lawmakers are prohibited from improperly splitting counties, townships and municipal corporations, and the General Assembly “must attempt, but is not required, to draw districts that are compact,” according to a Legislative Service Commission brief.
The 6-1 Republican Ohio Supreme Court has jurisdiction over any legal challenges to the map that may happen after it’s passed.
Both previous congressional maps were challenged, and both maps were found by a previous bipartisan 4-3 court majority to be unconstitutionally partisan, favoring the Republicans more than aligned with voting trends.
The makeup of justices on the state’s highest court has changed since then, and now holds a firm Republican majority of 6 to 1.
The Republican swing vote in both the previous congressional redistricting decisions was Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, who has since retired. Current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy was on the court for those cases and voted to reject the challenges.
If the congressional plan should get struck down as unconstitutional, the legislature has 30 days to adopt a new plan after appeals have been exhausted.
If the legislature still can’t agree or misses the deadline, the Ohio Redistricting Commission is once again brought in with another 30-day deadline.

(Getty Images)About a third of the parking lot of the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua spills over into Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. It’s a geographical quirk that means if shoppers park in the southern lot near the JCPenny or Buffalo Wild Wings, they could find themselves crossing state lines multiple times during their visit. 
But for the attorneys general of New Hampshire and 24 other Republican-led states, it’s a novelty that highlights what they say is a problem with Massachusetts’ gun laws. 
A New Hampshire resident who might be legally carrying a firearm on the New Hampshire side of the parking lot might find that same firearm illegal to carry to the Massachusetts side without a permit.
The 25 states say that arrangement is unconstitutional. This month, they’re taking that argument to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“If that person is carrying a firearm without a Massachusetts license — which would be constitutionally protected activity in most of the mall — that person risks being charged as a felon and facing mandatory incarceration in Massachusetts,” reads a brief from the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking about a visitor to the Pheasant Lane Mall. 
Led by New Hampshire, the states have come together to support the efforts of Philip Marquis, of Rochester, New Hampshire, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to protect non-Massachusetts residents from the Bay State’s firearms regulations. In an amici — or “friend of the court” — brief, lawyers at the New Hampshire Department of Justice say Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law should not apply to travelers from other states passing through.
Also joining the amici brief are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, asserts the law can apply to visitors and is constitutional. And the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, the conservative majority could apply a landmark 2022 decision that limited state firearms regulations to rule in favor of Marquis. And the result could dramatically change relations between gun-owning New Hampshire residents and those of its southern neighbor.
But the Supreme Court has been hesitant to take up challenges to gun laws in recent years that could help clarify its 2022 decision. And that has meant a backlog of cases against state firearm restrictions — and potentially the Marquis case — have been left unresolved recently, according to Joseph Blocher, a law professor and co-founder of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.
“I think the pressure is high on the Supreme Court to weigh in again. But they have not,” Blocher said in an interview. “They did not show much of an appetite for it for most of the last 20 years.”
Marquis previously brought a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the state’s court system, arguing that the state’s concealed carry firearms permit law is unnecessarily burdensome to out-of-state visitors. In March, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his claims and ruled that the state law passed constitutional muster. 
Now, Marquis is requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Massachusetts high court’s decision on federal constitutional grounds. In order for that to happen, the federal court must grant Marquis a “writ of certiorari,” which would allow them to accept arguments and hold an oral hearing.
For Marquis, the effort is personal; he is trying to overturn a conviction. In 2022, Marquis was driving on Interstate 495 when he got into an accident and pulled his car into the breakdown lane, according to his legal petition. At the time, he had an unloaded pistol in his pocket. When state police officers arrived to talk to him, Marquis announced that he had the pistol and removed it from his pocket. 
He told police officers that he did not have a Massachusetts firearm license, but that he is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm in New Hampshire because he has not been disqualified under federal law. New Hampshire state law allows the automatic concealed carry of firearms for anyone not federally disqualified; Massachusetts requires residents and non-residents to obtain a license by paying $100 and receiving approval from the colonel of the state police.
Because he was carrying the gun without a license, police charged Marquis with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition under Massachusetts state law, and a lower court convicted him.
Marquis has appealed that decision all the way to the highest Massachusetts court, and in doing so he’s invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that has upended state firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Police Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the court struck down a New York law that required residents to show “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit. 
In that decision, the court held that any state law that awards firearms permits on a discretionary basis, known as a “may issue” permitting law, is unconstitutional; only a law that awards permits on strict criteria — a “shall issue” permitting law — could be constitutional under the Second Amendment. And Bruen established that any state firearms restriction must adhere to the historical tradition of firearms regulation dating back to the passage of the Constitution — or be explicitly covered by the Second Amendment itself. 
Now, as Marquis attempts to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his challenge of the Massachusetts law could represent an opportunity for the court to expand the range of gun rights in the wake of the Bruen decision and limit Massachusetts’ regulatory power.
Neither Marquis nor the Republican attorneys general supporting his lawsuit are attempting to overturn Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law as it applies to Massachusetts residents. But they are seeking to establish that the law should not apply to out-of-state residents whose home states have less restrictive regulations.
And to do it, they are attempting to show that the state law violated Marquis’ Second Amendment right to bear arms and 14th Amendment right to travel and equal protection — and that, following Bruen, no historical reading of those amendments justifies applying Massachusetts’ law to out-of-state residents.
In their briefs, attorneys for Marquis and attorneys for the Republican states argue the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was wrong to decide that the state’s concealed carry permit law qualifies as a “shall issue” permitting law under Bruen. In reality, they say, the decision-making by the state police colonel makes the process a “may issue,” and thus unconstitutional.
In its March ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Marquis did not have standing to sue in Massachusetts court, but that even if he did, his challenge of the state law would not succeed. The court found that the state law passed the Bruen test because it attempts to restrict dangerous people from obtaining firearms, which it held follows historical tradition.  
“To the extent that the Commonwealth restricts the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms within its borders, the justification for so doing is credible, individualized evidence that the person in question would pose a danger if armed,” the state court’s decision read. “Both case law and the historical record unequivocally indicate that this justification is consistent with ‘the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’”
Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disagrees. The Cato Institute, a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, has also filed an amicus brief in Marquis’ petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, in which it argues that a contextual reading of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, indicates that its framers would have intended it to protect the firearms rights of freed slaves traveling to safer states.
“If you’ve been enslaved in Alabama, you sure want to get out of there and go and look for better economic opportunities in other states,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Now, you’re most certainly going to encounter the (Ku Klux Klan) at some point while you’re looking for work in other states. And guess what? You’re going to want to be able to be able to protect yourself, and not have to encounter some state regulation like they have in Massachusetts.” 
It is not clear whether the court will take up Marquis’ appeal, nor when it might make its decision. Despite its decision in Bruen, the conservative court has held back from dramatically expanding the scope of the Second Amendment. In 2024, it narrowed the scope of Bruen‘s in U.S. v. Rahimi, which affirmed the constitutionality of firearm restrictions for defendants in domestic violence case. But it has declined to take up a number of attempts to challenge state firearms restrictions in Democratic-led states, including two cases in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Crowder and Zemene v. Commonwealth. 
To Blocher, of the Center for Firearms Law, the question of whether Bruen negates out-of-state firearms license requirements is just one of many legal questions that have emerged in caselaw across the country since the 2022 decision. Federal lower courts are grappling with what Bruen means for gun possession by felons; location-based firearm restriction laws such as gun-free school zones; age restrictions; caps on high-capacity magazines; state bans on assault-style rifles; and more. The historical contextual test Bruen requires has at times provided more uncertainty than clarity, he says. And circuit courts are more likely than ever to split along partisan lines.
“It kind of looks like there’s some real confusion and disagreement,” he said. “Some lower courts are even saying, ‘Look, we’re just not equipped to do this kind of historical analysis. We’ve got busy dockets. We’re not like the Supreme Court. We have to decide more than 70 cases every year, and we don’t have the benefits of experts and friend of court briefs, and this is just impossible for us.'”
With scant action from the Supreme Court, the result has been something of a backlog.
Some Second Amendment advocates, like Neily, say the current John Roberts court has failed to follow through on necessary corrections to firearms laws. 
“The court has not manifested a serious commitment to vindicating the right to keep and bear arms, and one of the ways we can see that is in the numerous cases that it has turned away,” Neily said. 
But the string of denials have given hope to supporters of gun restrictions, for whom Bruen had struck a blow in 2022. 
“Even after Bruen, courts are upholding state, federal, and local gun laws against Second Amendment challenges,” a 2023 legal memo from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence states. “Most courts have recognized that, when properly applied, Bruen allows for a wide range of gun violence prevention laws.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gunconcealed-1024x733.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/ Stateline)NORTH CONWAY, N.H. — The conversations in French having given them away, the group of motorcyclists immediately stood out as foreigners over a Saturday breakfast in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
In the restaurant, the server was pleased, thanking them for coming. Because these days, tariffs and White House rhetoric have left Canadians a rare breed of visitors in New England, usually a hotspot vacation destination from the nearby province of Quebec.
“There’s a lot of people staying in Canada because of that,” said Dave Gingras, a 35-year-old biker from Saguenay, about two hours north of Quebec City.
While other Canadians are avoiding buying American products or traveling to the States, the group of 11 decided to leave politics behind on their road trip through New England.
“We are just keeping it neutral and trying to enjoy,” Gingras told Stateline.
After breakfast, they donned helmets and mounted an assortment of dusty Yamaha, BMW and Triumph bikes.
“We drive and when we’re tired, we stop and raise up a tent and relax with a beer,” Gingras said before pulling into a line of crawling traffic on the White Mountain Highway, the scenic byway dotted with quaint inns, old-timey stores and Colonial and Victorian homes.
Across Northeastern states, business owners and state officials have labored to maintain key economic connections with Canada despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. President Donald Trump’s trade war, aggressive immigration enforcement and talk of making their country the 51st state has offended many Canadians. While concerns are acute in New England, tourism hubs from Hawaii to New York are reeling from a decrease in Canadian visitors.
Number of Canadian tourists visiting New Hampshire down 30% this year, officials say

To quell tensions, Maine leaders erected signs in French to welcome Canadian visitors and New Hampshire’s governor just returned from a Canadian trip she took to strengthen trade and tourism.
But hospitality businesses this summer reported a sharp decline in visitors from the North — Canadian travel to New Hampshire is down about 30% this year, according to state officials. Border crossings into Vermont hit their lowest levels since 2021, according to federal data, as the Canadian government reported a 34% drop in the number of August car visits into the U.S. compared with the same month last year.
New England businesses remain concerned as the region turns the page on the summer vacation season to its vibrant autumn, known for luring leaf-peeping travelers from across the globe.

Tourism is vital for White Mountain Valley communities like North Conway. While it’s home to only about 2,300 people, the village is a historic travel hotspot known for outdoor activities, tax-free shopping and family-friendly theme parks.
While many people think of the area as a winter ski destination, summers are actually the largest travel draw, said Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
The drop in Canadian tourism has been especially evident during less popular travel times for Americans. For example, Canada’s Victoria Day, a late May holiday celebrating that queen’s birthday, has traditionally brought big crowds to the Northeast.
“Our retail outlets are a very, very popular destination for them during that time,” Proulx said. “And our retail outlets have reported that it was basically nonexistent this year.”
Proulx said local businesses have tried to lure travelers from close-by regions like the Boston area to help make up for the loss of Canadian tourists, “so it’s not an unrecoverable loss.” But the absence of visitors from parts North is hard to ignore.
“It almost feels like a birder might feel if they find a rare species,” he said. “If you see someone with a Canadian license plate, you notice it right away. It gives you a little bit of a smile.”
Aside from the economic loss, Proulx said he worries about longstanding relationships.
This scenic valley is nostalgic for many visitors from the U.S. and Canada alike. He said many people return again and again, sharing fond memories of their first camping trip along the Saco River, childhood trips to the Santa’s Village amusement park and picturesque rides on the Conway Scenic Railroad.
“So we just don’t want anybody thinking that they’re not welcomed here. That’s our biggest thing,” he said. “We want everybody to be able to call this their second home, to be able to visit and reconnect and feel welcomed.”
‘Towns are quieter’
In the heart of North Conway, tourists picnic on the grass in Schouler Park, look into the 1874-era train station and meander into shops selling hokey souvenirs and homemade fudge. Framing the village is the imposing Mount Washington, which at 6,288 feet boasts the tallest peak in the Northeast.
At one of the town’s busiest intersections, the crowds come in waves to the North Conway 5&10 Store. But even as families line up, employee Polly Howe said she hadn’t seen many Canadians this summer.
“It’s a shame,” she said, bouncing between the cash register, the candy counter and stocking staples like toys and hats.
In a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the souvenir shop has been around for 86 years and features a false-front facade, the kind made famous in boomtowns of the Old West. Manager Terri Johnson said she had encountered a good number of Canadians inside the shop, but said she didn’t blame any who felt put off by the political climate.
“I’m thankful they still come after all that,” she said.
It’s not just international relations that have changed tourism here.
A rainy start to the summer season didn’t help, and business owners say anxiety over the domestic economy and inflation have pinched travel budgets.

Mark Lahood says family travel has dipped at the three hotels he operates in the area.
“Towns are quieter,” he said this summer. “They’re not quiet, but they’re much quieter than years’ past.”
Some summer weekends, which traditionally sell out entirely, the three hotels had 30% vacancies, he said. And travelers are more keen for weekend trips than their weeklong road trips of previous seasons.
“With a seven-day trip, by the time they were all in, it’s a lot of driving, it’s a lot of gas money, it’s a lot of meals, it’s a lot of hotels,” he said. “And I think it’s just too much.”
To help with rising costs, he ran a free breakfast promotion for kids earlier in the summer. And he increased an existing international discount for Canadian guests.
“Did it help anything? Probably not. But you know, when you view it from a Canadian traveler, at least you made an effort.”
The decline in Canadian visitors has allowed for more local, spontaneous travel, said Genn Anzaldi, who owns J-Town Deli & Country Store in Jackson, New Hampshire.
“More day trippers for sure,” she said. “So maybe not as many people spending the night or as many nights.”
The scent of sizzling bacon and toasting panini fills her shop, which offers hot meals along with handmade gifts and convenience store staples.
Anzaldi, who also runs a cooperative marketing effort for a group of independent restaurants, said the local restaurant business was down, but not significantly.
The reason?
“Canadians,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the economy. That seems to be going well.”
About nine miles away from North Conway, things are a bit quieter in Jackson, home to a famed one-lane covered bridge. With its spas and boutique hotels, Anzaldi said the community is more known as a destination for weddings, romantic stays and outdoor getaways.
While Anzaldi said she hopes Canadian tensions settle soon, she noted that the matter lies in the political domain and there’s little business owners can do but carry on.
“We have to run, right?” she said. “We’re not personally going to go up and advertise.”
States try to ease federal tension
 To maintain tourism and trade, Democratic and Republican politicians in the Northeast have made overtures to their counterparts in Canada.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has met with Maine businesses near the border, embarked on a diplomatic Canadian tour and even installed “Bienvenue Canadiens” welcome signs near border crossings. But on her trip this summer, she was reminded that it’s not just tariffs that have irked Canadians — many are also worried about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
Ambassador Hoekstra says U.S. and Canadian leaders aiming to mend fences

“Lots of people don’t feel safe in the U.S. right now and for good reason,” Susan Holt, the premier of the New Brunswick province, told Mills, according to local news accounts. Holt has encouraged her constituents to avoid traveling to the United States.
Last year, the state said some 800,000 Canadians visited Maine. On her June trip, Mills asked Canadians to remember those who rely on the tourism industry.
“To the extent people feel angst about coming to Maine, just remember that if they aren’t coming to Maine, the ones that they’re hurting are the small mom and pop businesses,” the governor told News Center Maine while in Halifax.
Mills’ office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Similarly, New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said ahead of a trade mission that she aimed to welcome Canadians to the Granite State, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said last month. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
Ayotte’s office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment about her trip.
René Sylvestre, the Quebec province’s delegate to New England, said those gestures are appreciated. He spends much of his time meeting with state and business leaders. Last month, he met numerous state lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, where he is posted.
But he said calming federal tensions will be key to seeing a rebound in tourism.
“What we can see right now is people in Quebec are really sad with the whole situation,” he told Stateline. “But they’re saying, ‘Maybe we should stay and spend more time in Canada these days.’ So this is really the impact that we’ve seen, and we think that it’s going to take a while before it’s back to normal.”
A decline in international travel has hit border communities across the country — from New York state to Washington state. North Dakota   estimated that Canadian visitors spent about $14.4 million less in the first half of the year compared with last year, as the number of personal vehicles crossing the border from Canada declined by 30%. Other hubs for international visitors, including Las Vegas and Hawaii, are also seeing significant declines.
“Right now, it’s hard to turn back federal policy,” Hawaii state Sen. Ron Kouchi told Stateline in August.
Kouchi, a Democrat and president of the state Senate, said Canada has traditionally been among Hawaii’s top five travel markets. The state has sent tourism officials to trade shows and is trying to show Canadians, like all visitors, the Aloha State’s iconic hospitality. But he said that message hasn’t been persuasive, even coming from leaders of the solidly liberal state.
“While we argue about Republicans or Democrats, in other nations they simply look at Americans and they don’t see it as an R or a D thing,” he said. “It’s an American thing.”
A stormy beach season
Old Orchard Beach in Maine is a favorite of New Englanders and Canadians alike.
Part of the Portland metropolitan area, the vacation town sports a seaside amusement park and seven miles of sandy beaches. But some Canadians started to cancel their summer reservations to the area early on in Trump’s term.
Sean Nickless, who co-owns the 30-room Crest Motel with his family, said Canadians began calling off trips in January and February,
Those cancellations and poor weather foretold a slower summer. “It’s not as steady,” Nickless said, noting business had been inconsistent with shorter stays.
Rainy skies left few people at the bars and attractions lining the pier at Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 31. Hospitality businesses in this beach vacation town reported thinner crowds this summer as they faced poor weather and a drop in Canadian visitors. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)
Like many of the other beachfront properties here, the retro Crest Motel relies heavily on repeat customers, filled out by the occasional road tripper who ducks in from the angled carport to ask about an available room.
“The best you can do is let Canadians know they’re still welcome here,” he said from the motel’s small lobby scented with the aroma of a drip coffeemaker and a bright popcorn machine.
At the height of summer, rain ushered in what should have been a booming weekend along the Atlantic’s Saco Bay. Crest Motel guests swam, but only under the cover of the pool’s rolling roof.
Down the way, five teenagers stood listlessly inside a walkup Dairy Queen with no customers to serve. On the pier, arcade games, $1-per-visit restrooms and barstools sat idle. Few took up heavily advertised offers for pizza by the slice, $15 lobster rolls or fried clam cakes.
“I’ve never driven around Old Orchard Beach in the summer and seen ‘vacancy signs.’ I  have this year,” said state Sen. Donna Bailey, who represents the community. “I mean, you just never see that in the middle of July — all you see is ‘no vacancy’ signs.” A Democrat, Bailey emphasized that Canada isn’t some far-off destination for Mainers. People routinely cross the border for health care and work. They have friends and family on both sides.
“I mean, there’s some places up in northern Maine that the nearest hospital is in Canada, as opposed to in the United States. You know, some people have their babies over in Canada.”
But aside from emphasizing existing bonds, Bailey said Maine residents and officials were largely at the mercy of the federal government’s actions.
“I think it’s helpful to remind the Canadians of our personal relationship and that we are Maine and we’re Mainers, and so we’re not necessarily the same as the federal government,” she said. “But, yeah, it does only go so far.”

Massive storms brought record-breaking flooding in southeast Wisconsin about a month ago. Preliminary damage assessments conducted by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Wisconsin Emergency Management had suggested that over 1,500 residential structures were destroyed or sustained major damage and total damage costs estimated at over $33 million across three counties. Damage reports had also indicated over $43 million in public sector damage throughout six counties.
Gov. Tony Evers had officially requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration and FEMA funding during the last week of August. His request included access to FEMA’s Individual Assistance and Public Assistance for Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties, which could help residents get reimbursements for costs from flood damage. 
“We had Huge Victories in Wisconsin in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and it is my Honor to deliver BIG for Wisconsinites!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post about approving the FEMA funding. 
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wrote in a post on X that Trump called him to deliver the news of the approval. 
“Thank you to President Trump for continuing to deliver BIG TIME for Wisconsinites,” Johnson said. He also thanked U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil and Scott Fitzgerald for helping to lead the push for the assistance.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore had also called for the funding. 
“It’s been more than a month since disaster hit Wisconsin, and families are hurting. I have been fighting for these funds because Wisconsinites need help and they need it now,” Baldwin said in a statement. “I’ll continue to closely monitor to make sure Wisconsin gets everything we need to be on the road to recovery and the whole-of-government recovery effort does right by all Wisconsinites.”

But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”










America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.


Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Javier Zayas Photography/Getty ImagesGeorgia residents may face an uphill battle accessing COVID-19 vaccines this fall, as federal agencies consider sweeping changes to eligibility requirements for immunizations.
The process of updating vaccine guidelines — which for many years has been a matter of routine — is now increasingly uncertain amid shifting federal guidance on public health policies. And in the absence of a federal consensus, states are beginning to develop their own vaccine policies. Northeast and western states are forming new vaccine coalitions to provide access to residents who might not qualify under potential future Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, while Florida has announced plans to eliminate vaccine mandates altogether.
But Georgia, which is home to the Atlanta-based CDC, has held off on administering updated state guidelines — at least for now. Last week, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it will be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine until after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issues its annual recommendations. The panel is scheduled to meet in Atlanta from Sept. 18-19.
CDC vaccine panel abruptly overhauled by RFK Jr. says it will review childhood vaccination schedules

Established in 1964, ACIP is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access. Georgia is also one of a handful of states that have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, giving the panel’s decisions more weight than it has in some neighboring states.
In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with overseeing vaccine development, approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines aimed at providing immunity against the JN.1 variant. However, the new recommendations limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.
Part of the reason patients may have trouble accessing vaccines, advocates say, is because health care providers are uncertain about how to interpret new state and federal guidelines, and don’t want to risk violating the law.
“Usually, all of these groups and all of these people are in lockstep,” said Scott Thorpe, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Public Health Leadership. “They’re obviously not in lockstep right now, and so that’s part of why this process is breaking down, and it creates a lot of uncertainty for everybody.”
New Covid shots arriving in pharmacies. Why you may need a prescription – for now

If the CDC’s panel votes in favor of similar restrictions, Georgia residents who do not fit the eligibility criteria may be required to get a prescription before they can be given a COVID-19 booster shot, and pay for the full cost out of pocket. Georgia’s public health department said the out-of-pocket cost for last year’s vaccine was around $180.
Members of Georgia’s Board of Public Health, some of whom are former CDC employees, expressed skepticism about the upcoming ACIP recommendations at Tuesday’s board meeting. Board Chair Dr. James Curran, who previously spent more than two decades working at the CDC, criticized the “turmoil and huge morale problems” the agency has been facing in the wake of a deadly shooting and recent turnover of top officials.
“As far as I can tell, a major goal is to diminish the CDC role in vaccines in a lot of ways,” Curran told the board.
“What we can expect is very controversial guidance which will focus on vaccine injuries more than on vaccine expansion,” he added.
Georgia Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey stressed that the department is still “very committed to immunizations,” and said she has been in contact with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp as the department considers next steps. A Kemp spokesperson did not respond to questions about the governor’s stance on COVID-19 vaccine access.
“We are waiting to see the CDC/ACIP guidelines,” Toomey said, adding that the federal guidelines will also impact insurance and liability coverage for vaccines. “If it is really out of line with what we feel is appropriate, given the science and epidemiologic trends as we know it, we can make decisions then.”

New polling for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.
The post New poll shows high satisfaction with health insurance in M[...]","MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS ARE largely content with their health care quality and coverage, according to a new CommonWealth Beacon poll. But digging beneath the high level of satisfaction reveals access and cost issues leading to delayed care for residents across the Commonwealth. 
One third of residents say they have skipped or delayed seeking care due to cost in the last year, and 25 percent say cost led them to skip or delay seeking care for a dependent. Even getting that care can be a time gamble. A fifth of the state’s residents say they’ve had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment, and 16 percent have had to wait that long for a specialist. 
The sweeping poll on heath care access for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – ran from August 11 to 18 and surveyed 1,000 Massachusetts residents with a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Topline | Crosstabs)  

It paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.  
“There can be two truths,” said Steve Walsh, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association. “It can be true that we’re doing well, and it can also be true that we need to do better. And there is no doubt that health care costs are rising. It’s making it harder on employers, including our health care institutions – which are our largest employer in the Commonwealth – so the cost of care impacts their ability to invest in workforce and cutting-edge technologies as well.”  
“I don’t necessarily see [the poll results] as an outlier,” he added. “I see it as that we’re getting incredibly good care here, but we need to be more focused on making sure it’s affordable.” 
Massachusetts is highly insured – around 2 percent of the state is without some type of insurance coverage – and generally able to access care. A plurality (41 percent) of residents reported an employer plan as their primary source of health insurance, with 23 percent each saying MassHealth/Medicaid or Medicare.  
The vast majority of residents say they are either very satisfied (40 percent) or somewhat satisfied (36 percent) with their health insurance, with about the same sentiment for people whose care they manage.

When it comes to the selection of primary care physicians nearby covered by their health insurance, residents again largely report being very (42 percent) or somewhat (33 percent) satisfied, and similarly pleased with their selection of specialists. 
Given an open-ended question about how they would describe the health care system in Massachusetts, responses generally reflected three things: it’s excellent, it’s pricey, and it’s slow. 
“We have very good health providers in this area,” said a 54-year-old Chicopee woman. “There are just not enough doctors to provide care.”  
Respondents ranked Massachusetts highly compared to other states. Some 42 percent of residents said Massachusetts is one of the top states in terms of the quality of health care, which is in line with national rankings from groups like The Commonwealth Fund. The Bay State topped the country in overall rankings of health system performance, which aims to capture affordable health coverage, good-quality care, and the opportunity to live a healthy life. Another 27 percent of residents said Massachusetts care quality was above average, and just 2 percent said it was probably one of the worst states. 

These answers grew more positive with income and education level. While just a third of residents making less than $50,000 a year and 27 percent of those with a high school education or less said Massachusetts was one of the top states for health care quality, half of those making over $100,000 annually and 58 percent of those with advanced degrees identified it as a top state. 
One possible explanation for that discrepancy, said Rich Parr, vice president of the MassINC Polling Group, is “that quality is uneven and weighted towards those who can afford it.” 
Massachusetts has the fourth highest per capita health care spending in the country, according to KFF research. The state Health Policy Commission noted in 2024 that Massachusetts is the state with the second highest family health insurance premiums, including out of pocket spending, with the average annual cost of health care for a family exceeding $29,000. 
The Commonwealth Fund, in its national rankings, asks adults if they went without care in the last year due to cost. Its 2025 report using data from 2023 found that 7 percent of adults in Massachusetts went without care in the last year, and only 9 percent of state residents lacked “a usual source of care.” 
The MassINC Polling Group poll, however, included those who have delayed and skipped care in the last year – 33 percent of residents overall and 37 percent of residents making less than $75,000 a year. The Health Policy Commission in 2024 reported 40 percent of their survey respondents (and 48 percent of those with income below $50,000) said they are putting off seeing a doctor or going to a hospital, with cost being the major factor. 
Yet even as poll respondents decried the price of coverage, 30 percent think that Massachusetts health costs are middle of the pack compared to other states, with 10 percent saying it is one of the worst states and 13 percent one of the top states. 

Forty percent hold insurance companies most responsible for the cost of health care, with 16 percent blaming companies that own hospitals and medical practices, and 10 percent saying the costs are due to too many government regulations. 
State insurance regulators this year issued regulatory guidance requiring insurance companies to limit the growth of deductibles and co-pays for patients to the rate of inflation for medical care, Gov. Maura Healey’s office noted. They also negotiated a reduction in proposed insurance rates and approved $75.6 million in rebates to over 350,000 people covered by individual and small employer plans in Massachusetts. 

“The data bear out that we have a real cost challenge and a real system under stress,” said Doug Howgate, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. “It can be helpful to compare ourselves to other states, but we also need to take a look at what these impacts mean for our health care system, our state budget.”  
The state has to begin identifying issues including but not limited to federal Medicaid cuts that could lead to large swaths of people losing their coverage, he said, because “we know there are going to be additional stressors placed on that system over the next few years.” 
On Thursday, Howgate’s organization released an analysis of the looming costs of President Donald Trump’s recent sprawling tax and spend bill. Changes to federal Medicaid policy could reduce MassHealth enrollment by up to 200,000 members and significantly increase burdens on the state’s Health Safety Net. The cost of care for uninsured residents is covered through the safety net, which currently has a funding shortfall of approximately $290 million and reimburses providers at rates far below MassHealth. The changes could increase health safety net demand by up to $510 million, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. 
“Removing thousands of MassHealth members from consistent coverage is likely to worsen long-term health outcomes and reduce the largest and most consistent source of funding for community health centers and safety net hospitals already under significant fiscal strain,” the report’s authors wrote. 
Residents seem to be feeling those strains. While almost 40 percent told pollsters they waited less than two weeks between scheduling and having a primary care appointment, 12 percent said it took three to four weeks, 12 percent said one to two months, and 20 percent said it took more than two months. 
“Healthcare in Massachusetts is difficult to navigate,” said a 40-year-old woman in Freetown. “Not enough PCPs, wait months for the ‘soonest’ appointment, and when you get the appointment it’s a turn and burn visit. Typically, the wait in the lobby is longer than the appointment.” 

Residents in Southeast Massachusetts reported the longest waits – more than a quarter had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment. Residents in the Greater Boston area, which boasts the highest density of population and health care facilities, were most likely to report three-week to two-month waits. 
“I think the health care system in MA is just ok, not great,” wrote a 42-year-old man from Revere. “In my experience there are always very long waits when scheduling appointments, sometimes many months out. However, these problems probably exist everywhere, and I think MA is likely handling them better than other states.” 
State health officials are trying to address the primary care crisis and related spending in part through a dedicated task force under the Health Policy Commission. Healey’s office also highlighted two bills that she signed, which lower health care costs, cap prescription drug co-pays at $25, improve access to primary care, and increase oversight of the health care industry to protect patients and providers. 
 “Massachusetts has the best health care in the country, and we need to make sure people can afford it,” Healey said in a statement to CommonWealth Beacon. “It’s why we took action to make sure people can continue to get the vaccines they need no matter what happens in Washington, and that insurance will cover it. We also for the first time limited the cost of health care deductibles and co-pays, including capping prescription drug costs at $25.” 
For those who needed specialists, 32 percent of residents were able to get an appointment within two weeks, 18 percent between three and four weeks, 15 percent said one to two months, and 16 percent said they had to wait more than two months to have an appointment with a specialist. 

The contrast between patient experience and overall satisfaction is a bit of a head-scratcher, notes Parr of the polling group. 
“Massachusetts residents seem to have set a pretty low bar when it comes to rating their health insurance and health care experiences,” he said. Majorities are at least somewhat satisfied with their health insurance, despite a third saying they have skipped or delayed care due to cost in the past year, and nearly as many (28 percent) have had a claim denied by their insurance company in the past year, Parr noted.  
Residents who have skipped care or had a claim denied “do have a less rosy view” of their insurance, he said, but still, most of these residents are at least somewhat satisfied. 
“It may be that Massachusetts’s reputation for health care excellence is driving some of this,” he said. “If residents think they are in one of the top health care states – as most do – perhaps they figure that this is the best service they can expect to get.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Following a viral brawl in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio and federal officials are partnering with local law enforcement to fight violent crime.
Federal agencies including the U.S. Marshalls and U.S. Attorney’s office will step up pursuit of parole violations and firearm prosecutions.
Gov. Mike DeWine said this week during a news conference that highway patrol is helping bolster the Cincinnati Police Department.
“We will be providing, and have been providing, to different cities additional manpower and technology in specific circumstances where local authorities, frankly, could use some help,” DeWine said. “Our troopers, since I became governor, have partnered with law enforcement officers in a number of cities — Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Youngstown, Toledo, and now Cincinnati.”
In addition to helping police patrol hotspots, the patrol will be contributing air support to monitor suspects fleeing the scene of a crime.
DeWine emphasized federal law is “extremely, extremely tough” when it comes to defendants found with a gun illegally — an offense known having a weapon under disability.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Dominick Gerace offered assurances that federal officials “care very deeply about local crime.”
“As governor DeWine mentioned, our federal charges carry stiff penalties,” Gerace said. “And we’ll bring those charges from investigations that occur or start at any level — local, state, or federal — and that includes investigations that come off of operations that result from the partnerships that are being announced today.”
The move to prioritize federal prosecution of gun crimes echoes a similar effort from former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers following a spike in homicides in Columbus five years ago.
In an aside, DeWine added, “I wish in the state of Ohio we had a law similar to that. This is not the day to get into that, but I will just say that I would again call upon our state legislature to enact a law similar to what is at the federal level.”
The governor has indeed urged lawmakers to impose new firearm restrictions — particularly after a mass shooting in Dayton’s Oregon district in 2019.
His appeals fell on deaf ears.
Meanwhile, DeWine has signed several measures loosening Ohio’s gun laws including arming teachers, permitless carry, and stand your ground legislation.

Pointing to the to the city’s crime gun intelligence center, Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said her department has long welcomed collaboration with other agencies.
Since the office launched in 2022, they’ve seen “double digit reductions in shooting victims,” she said.
Theetge described the partnership with state and federal officers as “a force multiplier” to build on what the city is already doing.
“We have more eyes, more hands and more hearts committed to the cause of safety,” she said.
Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval said he welcomed the help. He said the city’s recent crime stats offer “a mixed message.”
According to a violent crime survey from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, in the first quarter of this year, Cincinnati’s incidents of homicide, rape, and aggravated assault were down compared to the prior year. Only robberies saw a modest increase.
But in the latest MCCA survey, which covers violent incidents through the end of June, homicides have shot up, now surpassing the amount in the first half of 2024. Robberies have pulled further ahead as well.
Still, Pureval insisted the city is making progress.
“Street level crimes like theft from cars and burglaries have dramatically dropped with property crimes now down year over year, city wide,” he said. “However, violent crime continues to be a challenge.”
The mayor stated violent crime overall is down, but they’re seeing increases specific areas like downtown and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhoods.
Regardless of the data, though, Pureval said he recognizes people don’t feel safe and that it’s incumbent on local leaders to address that.
“We are still working urgently on public safety,” he said. “While it’s important to be aware of the data, what’s also important is to continue to respond from concerns from the community, and that’s exactly what we continue to do.”

Reporting Highlights

Evidence: The government seeks to deport an Ohio chaplain, but its case has come under scrutiny from supporters and legal advocates.
Support: The U.S. paints the chaplain as a link in terrorist organizations, but in Ohio, families laud his work at a children’s hospital and in the community.
Test Case: If the government secures its quest for deportation, experts say the case could empower the Trump administration’s mass deportation blueprint.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 			



In the weeks leading up to July 9, Ayman Soliman told friends he was terrified of losing the sanctuary he’d found after fleeing Egypt in 2014 and building a new life as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
Soliman, 51, was to show up at 9 a.m. on that date for his first check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since losing his asylum status. He’d been granted the protections in 2018 under the first Trump administration. Then, in the last month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke them based on sharply disputed claims of fraud and aid to a terrorist group. Once President Donald Trump returned to office weeks later, court records show, immigration officials bumped up the terrorism claims and formalized the asylum termination June 3.
By the time of Soliman’s ICE appointment, friends said, he was distraught over the prospect of being returned to the regime that had jailed him for documenting protests as a journalist. He arrived at the agency’s field office in Blue Ash, Ohio, accompanied by fellow clergy and a couple of Democratic state lawmakers.
“I didn’t come to America seeking a better life. I was escaping death,” he said in a video filmed just before he entered.
Inside, Soliman’s attorneys said, he was shocked to find FBI agents waiting for him. They interrogated him for three hours about his charity work more than a decade ago in Egypt, the basis for the Department of Homeland Security accusations of illegal aid, or “material support,” to Islamist militants.
His lawyer eventually emerged from the ICE office holding a belt and a wallet. Soliman had been swept into custody, joining a record 61,000 people now in ICE detention. As he awaits an immigration court trial Sept. 25, he is being held in a county jail run by a sheriff who posted a sign outside reading, “Illegal Aliens Here.”
Legal observers are watching the chaplain’s case as a bellwether of the Trump administration’s ability to merge the vast federal powers of immigration and counterterrorism. The case is also a reminder, they say, of sweeping post-9/11 statutes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of abusing, especially in cases involving Muslims.
Material support laws ban almost any type of aid to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist groups, extending far beyond the basics of weapons, personnel and money. Prosecutors describe the laws as an invaluable tool against would-be attackers, but civil liberties groups have long complained of overreach.
Over the years, successive administrations have faced legal challenges over how they wield the power; a milestone Supreme Court decision during the Obama administration upheld the laws as constitutional. Now, however, there are particular fears about the material support “sledgehammer,” as one legal scholar put it, in the hands of Trump, who has been openlyhostile toward Muslims and determined to deport a million people who are in the United States without permission.
“These statutes are written extraordinarily broadly with the unstated premise that discretion will be exercised responsibly. And one thing this administration has shown is that it doesn’t understand what it means to exercise discretion responsibly,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who argued high-profile material support cases and served as national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
At issue are DHS allegations that Soliman’s involvement with an Islamic charity provided material support to the Muslim Brotherhood. But neither the charity nor the Brotherhood is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and an Egyptian court found no official ties between the groups.

The Biden-era DHS, which first flagged the issue, said it would revoke Soliman’s asylum if “a preponderance of the evidence supports termination” after a hearing, according to the December notice. At the time, court records show, the material support allegation was listed as a secondary concern after more common asylum questions about the veracity of official documents and his claims of persecution in Egypt.
Once Trump came to power weeks later, Soliman’s attorneys said, the material support claims metastasized, with U.S. authorities declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a Tier III, or undesignated, terrorist group and adding new arguments about ties to Hamas. The Brotherhood, a nearly century-old Islamist political movement, renounced violence in the 1970s, though Hamas and other spinoffs are on the U.S. blacklist. In addition to the Egypt-related concerns, DHS filings about Soliman had noted warrants for “murder and terrorism” in Iraq — a country Soliman says he’s never visited.
By elevating the national security argument, Soliman’s lawyers said, DHS was able to bypass an immigration judge and order the chaplain held without bond as “potentially dangerous.” An established terrorism nexus means less transparency for immigrants — and more power for the authorities.
“DHS is judge, jury and executioner,” said Robert Ratliff, one of Soliman’s attorneys.
The idea of Soliman as a secret militant has outraged residents who know him locally as “the interfaith imam” and the first Muslim on the pastoral care team at Cincinnati Children’s, a top-ranked pediatric hospital. Colleagues described a popular chaplain with nicknames for the tiny patients and soothing words for their bleary-eyed parents.
Judy Ragsdale, the former pastoral care director who hired Soliman in 2021 shortly before retiring, said she wrote a letter to hospital leaders imploring them to speak out against the allegations that could return him to certain persecution in Egypt. He lost authorization to work in June, when his asylum was terminated.
“This is a ‘Schindler’s List’ moment,” Ragsdale said she told hospital leaders. “And if you don’t stand up for Ayman, you’re complicit in what’s happening to him.”
Some fear DHS is parlaying the scope and secrecy of counterterrorism laws into a weapon to boost the president’s mass-deportation mission.
Immigrant rights groups say a sped-up campaign with fewer guardrails for due process is already leading to removals based on evidence that hasn’t been fully vetted. If DHS is successful in test cases like Soliman’s, they say, material support claims could be more easily applied to immigration cases with even tenuous links to militant factions, including newly designated cartels.
The White House referred questions to Homeland Security, which routed a request for comment to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; a spokesperson there said in a statement that the agency generally “does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
“An alien — even with a pending application or lawful status — is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” the statement said. The FBI declined to comment.
Jeffrey Breinholt, an architect of the material support statutes who spent three decades as a federal terrorism prosecutor, defends the laws as crucial to closing loopholes that were exploited by foreign militant groups and their domestic sympathizers.
Breinholt, who retired in 2024, said he has no concerns about the widening scope as it converges with Trump’s deportation push. The designation of cartels, he said, “is a natural outgrowth of the success we have had with ‘material support’ crime.”
To Cole and other critics, however, the Soliman case could be “the canary in the coal mine.”
 More Than a Chaplain

Within a few hours of Soliman’s detention, dozens showed up for an impromptu rally and news conference in the ICE center parking lot. That backup has since grown into a hundreds-strong campaign to refute the DHS allegations, which supporters call a resurgence of anti-Muslim fearmongering that has persisted across party lines since the 9/11 attacks 24 years ago this month.
“Any time you have a brown man or a Muslim man and you use the words ‘FBI’ and ‘red flag,’ you don’t have to say any more,” said Tala Ali, a friend of Soliman’s who heads the board of a Cincinnati mosque where he sometimes led prayers.
Voices calling for Soliman’s release include parents who met him in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The families are in disbelief that the chaplain they’d grown close to is now jailed in a high-stakes international case. They knew he’d fled Egypt but said they were learning details of his ordeal through the campaign to free him.
“It would be very easy to be resentful and be angry with the world when you have to live through that kind of trauma, and he’s not like that at all. He’s taking on other peoples’ trauma,” said Heather Barrow, whose infant daughter, Mya, died in the NICU last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She said Soliman stepped in to spare her grieving family the heartache of making funeral arrangements for a 5-month-old. He attended Mya’s celebration of life and, later, a butterfly release on June 7, which would’ve been her first birthday. A month later, he was in an ICE cell.
“I was like, how is this happening? He was just at our house,” Barrow said.
Another couple, Taylor and Bryan McClain, also came to rely on Soliman when their newborn, Violette, arrived at Cincinnati Children’s last year with life-threatening complications. The chaplain steadied them during their 271 days in the NICU, which Taylor said felt like “a roller coaster in a tornado and it’s on fire.” The McClains call him “family.”
“I say with full confidence: Violette is alive because of the advocacy that Ayman gave us,” Taylor said one recent afternoon as she held her daughter, now just over a year old.
Clergy members make up another bloc of support — so many that they built a spreadsheet to divide visiting hours among imams, rabbis and pastors. Immigration advocates and Ohio civil rights leaders have added their names to petitions. So have University of Cincinnati student groups including the Ornithology Club and the Harry Potter Appreciation Club.
More than a dozen people faced criminal charges stemming from a melee after a rally in Soliman’s support; demonstrators and police blame each other for the violence July 17.
Two of Soliman’s fellow chaplains at Cincinnati Children’s, Adam Allen and Elizabeth Diop, said they lost their jobs for refusing to keep quiet about their jailed colleague. Meanwhile, the hospital, a cherished local institution, is taking heat for its silence. Soliman’s supporters launched a letter-writing campaign demanding a response from the hospital, which has said it does not discuss personnel issues.
Signs appeared outside the hospital. “Missing Chaplain,” they said. “Abducted By ICE.”
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital did not return messages seeking comment. In an internal memo published by The Cincinnati Enquirer, hospital CEO Dr. Steve Davis told employees that the lack of response “should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.” As a nonprofit, Davis stressed, the hospital has strict rules about “activities that could be characterized as political.”
Soliman’s supporters press on. One recent Sunday evening, about 200 filled a Cincinnati church where preachers from several faith backgrounds urged them to demand his freedom.
“The trial that Imam Ayman is going through is our trial,” Abdulhakim Mohamed, head of the North American Imams Fellowship, told the crowd. “His justice is ours to own. The injustice is also ours to bear.”
 Escape From Egypt

Soliman’s entanglement with the Egyptian security apparatus began in 2000 when he joined fellow college students to protest repressive laws, he said in asylum papers.
He was periodically locked up and intimidated after that, he said. The persecution worsened more than a decade ago during uprisings that remade the Middle East by toppling dictators — including Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak — but in some places spiraled into civil war.
Soliman worked as a freelance journalist covering pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and neighboring Libya. Friends say he was also studying to become an imam and served on the board of a local chapter of the Islamic charity Al-Gameya al-Shareya, which is known for its network of hospitals and orphan programs throughout Egypt.
The charity, whose name has multiple English spellings, launched in 1912 and is often described as “one of the most established national Islamic organizations.” Scholars have written that early leaders came from the Muslim Brotherhood, archenemy of Egypt’s current military leadership, but that ties ended around 1990 under government pressure.
In the years since, researchers found, the group maintained smooth relations with the government as its more than 1,000 chapters nationwide encompass Egyptians of all political leanings. That delicate balance faltered briefly in 2013 when a military-led counterrevolution quashed the nascent democratic movement and deposed elected leaders who were part of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt’s military rulers declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and shuttered any organization it suspected of ties. Al-Gameya Al-Shareya was among more than 1,000 civil society groups blacklisted in the crackdown, court filings say, and chapters suspected of helping the Brotherhood during elections were dissolved. The group resumed operations the next year, when an Egyptian court lifted the ban, ruling that the charity “has no ties to the Muslim Brotherhood,” according to news reports.

Egypt’s return to zero tolerance for dissidents made Soliman’s activism dangerous, he said in court papers. As a journalist and Islamic scholar, he represented two fields the Egyptian government views as existential threats: a free press and religious organizing.
Soliman fled to the United States in 2014 on a visitor visa and later filed a petition for asylum, describing how security forces over the years had locked him up on false charges and tortured him with electrical shocks. In one incident, his attorney said, Egyptian forces with machine guns stormed into an apartment where Soliman was asleep with his wife and young child. (Through attorneys, Soliman asked to withhold details about his family because they remain in Egypt.)
“For me, it’s life or death,” Soliman later told a U.S. immigration officer of his need to escape.
Officials in Cairo referred questions to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, which did not respond to requests for comment.
The asylum application asked whether Soliman had belonged to political parties or other associations in his home country. Ratliff, the attorney, said Soliman marked “yes” and attached a statement that mentioned Al-Gameya Al-Shareya and his role in fundraising for the local chapter.
Friends said Soliman rejoiced when he was granted asylum in 2018, under the first Trump administration, and sought permanent residency as the next step toward reuniting with his family. But the process stalled. “Bureaucratic hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle,” Ratliff said.
Then came a more serious snag. In 2021, Soliman learned he was on a federal watchlist when a background check for a chaplain job at an Oregon prison showed that the FBI had flagged him, court papers show.
His attorneys said they have no idea why. It could’ve been about a specific piece of intelligence. It could’ve been a misspelling or mistaken identity, simple errors that have landed ordinary Muslims on opaque “war on terror” watchlists that are nearly impossible to get off.
Soliman, friends say, insisted on trying to clear his name. With the help of the Muslim Legal Fund of America, he sued government agencies including the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. That route led to open-ended legal battles that yielded no clear answers and no green card.
Instead, his place in the country became more vulnerable. In December, the final stretch of the Biden administration, Soliman received notice that the government intended to terminate his asylum based on “inconsistencies” in his claims of persecution and concern that his charity work made him inadmissible based on “possible membership in a terrorist organization.”
Some of his friends are convinced it was payback for the lawsuits, but attorneys say there’s no telling what triggered a review.
“What Ayman has experienced is something that, post-9/11, has been the reality of Muslims in this country,” said Ali, his friend and advocate. “All he did was try to get answers and accountability for what he’d been put through.”
 Big Claims, Little Transparency

Contested asylum cases like Soliman’s were prime targets when Trump took office the next month and supercharged deportations, a top campaign pledge. Since his return to office, ICE arrests have doubled.

Soliman was called to an asylum hearing in February, a month into the new administration, for a last shot at defending his eligibility. A DHS officer asked about claims in the Biden-era notice alleging “discrepancies in date and number of times he suffered harm” and raising doubts about a handwritten Egyptian police report and letters authenticating his journalistic work.
A transcript shows Soliman explaining that he sometimes got confused when describing traumatic incidents from years ago in English, his second language. He said the police report was a rough translation included by mistake and submitted statements verifying his journalism.
Then the DHS officer’s questioning took a turn: “When did you start supporting Al-Jameya Al-Shareya?”
For the rest of the meeting, the transcript shows, the officer drilled down on Soliman’s knowledge of the charity: fundraising, chapter size, support for violence and whether he had been aware of a Brotherhood link.
Another of Soliman’s attorneys interrupted when the immigration officer said the Brotherhood had been a Tier III group since 2012. That’s not how it works, the attorney countered — only top-tier terrorist organizations like al-Qaida or the Islamic State are given dates of designation. Tier III, she said, is for undesignated groups and is determined on a case-by-case basis, with the burden of proof on the government.
“Counsel, I’ll give you an opportunity at the end to make a closing,” the DHS officer said.
“I understand,” the attorney replied, “but we’re talking about something factual.”
The next time Soliman heard from DHS was the official termination of his asylum, effective June 3. This time, there was no hedging in language that declared he was ineligible based on “evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier III terrorist organization.” A few weeks later, he was taken into custody and notified of his pending removal.
Soliman’s legal team sued, arguing that he was stripped of asylum on illegal grounds because the designations had been made “without proper findings” and based on no new evidence.
Court filings show DHS attorneys introducing, then withdrawing or amending, materials to build a case linking Soliman to the Brotherhood through the charity.
“It looked like, ‘What can we put here to get to there?’” said Ratliff, a former immigration judge.
Among the supporting evidence filed by the government are three academic reports by scholars with deep knowledge of Islamic charities in Egypt. Soliman’s legal team filed statements from all three balking at how DHS had cherry-picked their research.
Steven Brooke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailed “important mistakes of fact and interpretation.” Neil Russell, an academic in Scotland, called the U.S. conclusions “a mischaracterization of my findings.” Marie Vannetzel, a French scholar who has conducted field research with Al-Gameya Al-Shareya, rebutted what she called “a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”
Vannetzel wrote that she rejects the idea that Soliman, “simply by virtue of his activity in the association, could be accused of providing material support to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Observers of Cairo’s unsparing campaign to uproot Islamist opposition say the matter is clear-cut: If the charity survived the scrutiny of Egyptian intelligence, then it’s not Muslim Brotherhood. “It’s really striking that this group is not proscribed,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt specialist and U.S. program director of the nonprofit International Crisis Group.
Soliman’s attorneys also criticized the government’s assertion in court filings that he, as a board member of one local branch, would’ve been aware of any Brotherhood affiliation of chapters nationwide. “If a Rotarian in Seattle commits murder, we don’t go charging Rotarians in Des Moines with conspiracy,” Ratliff said.
Separate from U.S. attempts to tie Soliman to the Brotherhood was a puzzling footnote about Iraq that appeared in a later filing. Without detail, DHS attorneys alluded to warrants for “murder and terrorism activities.” Ratliff said a DHS attorney later confirmed to him in a phone call that it wasn’t about Soliman, but didn’t explain why it was there.
The error remained uncorrected in filings until Sept. 3, when DHS attorney Cheryl Gutridge acknowledged in court that it was an “inadvertent” reference to another case, Ohio news outlets reported. The original wording suggesting that Soliman faced murder charges in Iraq had been included in the government’s successful argument for keeping him in custody.
DHS did not address questions about the Iraq reference.
A close friend, Ahmed Elkady, said Soliman told him on a jail visit he was stunned to be linked to Iraq, a place he’s never been: “He said, ‘How can I become a virtual terrorist?”
 A Sheriff’s ICE Fiefdom

As he awaits trial in immigration court, Soliman is in custody at the Butler County Jail, about 30 miles outside of Cincinnati, past cornfields and a German social club and the Town and Country Mobile Home Park.
For more than 20 years, this outpost has been the domain of Sheriff Richard Jones, a cowboy hat-wearing firebrand who keeps a framed photo of Trump in his office. In the run-up to the 2024 election, Jones mused that a Trump victory might put him “back in the deportation business.”
From 2003 to 2021, the jail had been contracted to house immigration detainees until the arrangement dissolved in the Biden era. As predicted, the county entered into a new agreement with ICE in February, after Trump returned to power, to hold around 400 detainees: $68 a day per person, plus $36 an hour for the sheriff’s office toward transportation.
Jones celebrated the restored partnership by posting a fake image showing inflatable gators outside the jail, a nod to ICE’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida. A Black Lives Matter group in Dayton issued a statement calling the sheriff’s post an “egregious act of cruelty and historical mockery.”
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

As it returns to deportation work, the jail still faces a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in 2020 by two ICE prisoners who said they endured beatings and discrimination. One plaintiff, a Muslim, said a jailer called him a “fucking terrorist” and threatened to throw his prayer rug in the toilet. Jones has disputed the claims.
The sheriff is in the news again because of Soliman. In court filings, the Muslim chaplain says he was denied access to a space where he could lead communal prayers and then placed in “isolation” for nearly a week with only an hour of phone access between midnight and 1 a.m.
Soliman’s attorneys say in court papers that the episode was related to “targeted harassment” over his religion. The sheriff’s office told local outlets that it respects religious freedom and said Soliman was placed in isolation because he was “argumentative” and “threatening.”
After agreeing to an interview with ProPublica, Jones later decided he was “no longer interested,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Deputy Kim Peters, wrote in a text message.
As he languishes in jail, Soliman’s empty apartment in Cincinnati has become a way station for an inner circle of supporters, who said they felt like “intruders” when they first gathered there. Soliman is known as an elegant dresser, but his apartment was in bachelor-pad disarray, a reflection of his long hours at the hospital and the abruptness of his detention, said his friends, also clerics. The imams laughed when one confessed that he first thought the FBI had ransacked the place.
Over water bottles and energy drinks scavenged from Soliman’s fridge, they talked about the deportation threat. In Egypt, pro-government news outlets already have trumpeted the case as proof that Soliman was leading a secret Brotherhood cell in America.
Despite Soliman’s predicament, they said, being in limbo here is preferable to the alternative.
“You think I’m afraid of being here in jail?” Soliman told fellow imam Ihab Alsaghier during a recent visit. “Every moment I’m alone, I imagine I’m on a flight back to Egypt.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ayman-Clapping-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 04:56:45.436875

(Eric Thomas illustration)Dear Cracker Barrel, 
We need to talk about your redesigned logo. The one you released last month to nationwide groans. The one paired with new interior designs for your restaurants. The one that shoved your stock price into a tumble. The one that sent you scrambling back to your traditional logo less than two weeks later. 
First, let me say this: The only times I’ve eaten at Cracker Barrel was when I lived in a small town.
Twenty-four years ago, our country home, a two-story farmhouse with a tin roof, squatted in the Indiana fields. My wife and I had a firepit where we shared evening beers while birds and bats swooped above our heads, divebombing bugs under a summer sunset. Behind the home was a red barn, and on its side a previous owner wrote “NO PRISON” as a protest against plans for a jail.
We had a new dog and a few acres. And we ate biscuits and gravy at Cracker Barrel. 
If that sounds like the start of a country song, that’s my point.
Your now infamous redesign went wrong by ignoring a quality — let’s call it “country” — that made Cracker Barrel unique.
Because the restaurant is so connected to its country identity, I bet that people would have shrugged if you had renamed the restaurant “Country Barrel.” Instead, the changes to the logo made conservative America gasp and boycott.
Let’s break down your changes to the logo.
Your company, which has five restaurants in Kansas, announced last month that the logo and interior design of its 660 nationwide restaurants would be updated. Because I teach visual design and not interior design, I will stick to your (attempted) logo switch.
For years, your logo featured three main elements. Let’s inspect each one to understand the outrage you absorbed.
On the left side of the logo is a duotone image of a man leaning against a barrel, sitting in a wooden kitchen chair with a woven seat. Clad in overalls, his legs cross as he smiles directly at us. The image mimics prints made from woodcuts, the kind of illustrations printed before mass production of photographs was possible. He is an old-timer shown in an old timey way.
Let’s also note how clumsy that duotone image was. The barrel was illustrated in one style: crisp, linear and simple. The man and the chair? They are illustrated with more nuance and shadowing, reflecting the true textures of real life.
Why am I pointing out this contrast? This is the kind of stuff that drives graphic designers bonkers. I can imagine the in-house graphic design team at corporate headquarters itching to discard this awkward asymmetry: “Let’s ditch grandpa. His illustrated style is so incongruous! So cacophonous!”
On the right side of the logo are the words “Cracker Barrel” held inside a pumpkin-ish shape. So, the logo had a bumpkin and a pumpkin.
The contours of the shape provide room for the upper-case “C” but amputate the letter “B.” (Again, urbane graphic designers wince.) Elsewhere, the stroke of the “k” veers wildly up and to the right. It’s a flourish that mimics handmade country signs before the standardization of typefaces and desktop publishing.
The pumpkin shape that holds the brand name? We can imagine it dangling from two chains on Main Street in a small, southern town. Just like grandpa to the left, the right side of the logo is drenched in country schmaltz.
The final element of the logo was the bottom: the words “OLD COUNTRY STORE.” The typography here is more contemporary through its use of a condensed, all-caps sans serif font. But this is not trendy typography. The logo’s mood remains as safe in its country aesthetic as the center line on a deserted gravel road. 
How did the logo redesign go, Cracker Barrel?
You axed two of the three elements, and the final element was drastically changed. Goodbye to the old-timer and his clip-art barrel, side-lit in the country sunset.
And good bye to “OLD COUNTRY STORE.”
If those changes slapped traditionalists in the face, the changes to the design of the brand name were a gut punch.
In the new brand logo, the color changes migrate from the country and right into the suburbs. The former color of the typography was warm brown, a color connected with rural life. Think agriculture (dirt), manual labor (mahogany stain) and barbecue sauce.
The new typography color is nearly black — if not pure black: sleek, balletic and urban. The color choices drive us a few more miles away from the county fair.
You changed the pumpkin shape to a hexagon with rounded corners. The logo’s typography centers itself inside, with plenty of room to spare. If the shape calls back to anything, perhaps it’s vintage Texaco signs. But what’s the use in that?
The redesign abandoned a central value that customers saw in your restaurants: the country charm of reclaimed wood, down-home cooking and an old timer in overalls. No wonder our country’s polarized, high-octane outrage machine shipped a fresh installment of umbrage to the front door of your corporate headquarters.
In the end, Cracker Barrel, you know the irony of this as well as I do.
There are five restaurant locations in Kansas — none of them in the country. All of them are in the exurbs, squatting at the exits from major highways: Junction City, Olathe, Topeka and two in Wichita. The big wide country of western Kansas has zero Cracker Barrels.
But Denver has one.
Your restaurants are surrounded by convenience stores, big-box retailers and interstate motels. You’re as country as Great Clips, Kohl’s and Mizu Sushi.
So maybe your attempted corporate redesign — a purge of the logo’s rural symbolism — is perfect after all. Maybe you were never as quite as country as any of us imagined.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.)At a recent rally in Hilliard sponsored by the Americans for Prosperity PAC, Ohio Republican governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched into a predictable GOP attack on public education. 
“We are going to bring a radical revolution of standards to our public schools,” he told the gathering.
If you want to go beyond Ramaswamy’s rhetoric, look at a few key words he used, including radical and standards, in his remarks about student outcomes in reading and math. 
Let’s also consider what he didn’t say in the predictable Republican exercise of bashing “failing public schools.”
Contrary to Ramaswamy’s assertion of bringing a radical revolution of standards, in fact it’s the private and religious schools that Ramaswamy and his fellow Republicans favor that mostly lack the kind of common standards that public schools must meet. 
In Ohio, for example, there is no requirement for private and religious schools to take state assessments, the very instruments that provide the reading and math data as well as state report cards that provide ammunition for public education critics. 
Never mind that all Ohio public school students, unlike students enrolled in the 1,300 non-public schools, are required to participate in state testing.
Back to that word radical for a moment. 
Isn’t it extreme to provide $6,166 per pupil for K-8 students and $8,408 for high school students with no required measures in place to assess the performance of the schools receiving taxpayer dollars?

Ramaswamy, a proud entrepreneur, knows quite well that it’s a radical step for any entity, particularly the State of Ohio, to invest $1 billion on a universal voucher initiative and receive no data about the level of performance or impact such spending might have generated.
Now that’s radical, don’t you think?
So think report cards. 
Think reading and math scores for those private and religious schools that accept public money. 
But expect them to also say that it’s socialism to have strings attached as part of having access to the public treasury in the form of education vouchers.
Whether it’s private and religious schools, their proponents have mastered the art of having it both ways: ‘Yes, we believe in and promote school choice. But don’t ever ask us to comply with state assessment standards that can assist the public in having a more comprehensive school report card system. Just send the money.’
And don’t talk about “School Choice” when it’s really about the “School’s Choice” as demonstrated by who is and isn’t admitted and by the “counsel out” process for those students who require more services and instructional support.
But wait, there’s more to consider about Ramaswamy’s remarks that focused on reading and math achievement. 
In these days of rapidly advancing technology and artificial intelligence, what about instruction in science in private and religious schools?
If non-public schools are exempt from so many of the requirements that are mandatory for public schools, do we have assurances that science is even taught in them, particularly those that are affiliated with conservative Christian and other sects?
This statement published several years ago from Americans United for Separation of Church and State gets to the heart of the issue of bad science or no science in some religious schools that are partially supported by the public treasury:

        “There are young people all over America right now learning not just that evolution is weak, but that it’s false. These children are being taught that the Earth, which we know to be five billion years old, is only 6,000 years old. They are being taught that dinosaurs and humans existed at the same time.”

Residents of New York State saw a similar situation a few years back when a group of ultra-religious schools were quick to apply for state funds while ignoring the delivery of a curriculum that would prepare a young person with the necessary tools to be successful – and literate. 
One education expert had this observation:

        “When the state or city says that the yeshivas should provide an education for their students that is ‘substantially equivalent’ to secular education, their leaders cry ‘separation of church and state!’ But, inconsistently, their representatives in the legislature actively lobby for tuition tax credits and vouchers. They want the state’s money but not its oversight of the education they provide.”

Sounds like Ohio, doesn’t it?  
As the debate on no-strings educational vouchers continues, Ohio citizens must be strong in demanding oversight for the expenditure of scarce public dollars that may be going to public and religious schools that lack the transparency needed to ensure that students are prepared for an increasingly complex world.
So, it’s time for the “Science of Reading” to be joined by a new initiative that will ensure that students who receive taxpayer-supported educational vouchers are taught …. science.
Let’s call this new initiative Science in Science, where all citizens are assured that the expenditure of public tax dollars in any school in the state support a proper public purpose and produce an informed citizenry that is literate in science as well as reading and math.

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission, which said Thursday that it will take until at least February 2027 to complete its review of the controversial Piedmont power line. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland regulators will take until at least February 2027 before they can issue a final ruling on the proposed Piedmont power line, according to a schedule set Thursday by the Maryland Public Service Commission.
That schedule is almost a year longer than PSEG Renewable Transmission, the New Jersey-based company planning the line, had hoped for. The company had said that the PSC  would need to issue its decision by the end of March 2026 in order for it to meet a deadline from the region’s electric grid operator to bring the controversial line in-service by June 2027.
The grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has warned that the 67-mile transmission line is among the projects that are necessary in order for it to avoid power failures such as blackouts amid surging demand, thanks in part to the rise of data centers, particularly in Virginia.
But the PSC said in a news release Thursday, in essence, that the grid can wait while it takes the time needed for it to fully evaluate the project.
“In adopting this schedule that includes a longer timeline than PSEG had requested, the Commission has confidence that PJM, the region’s grid operator, will efficiently maintain the grid during the duration of the Commission’s review of PSEG’s application,” read the statement from the five-member Commission, a five-member commission.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

The commissioners also argued that PSEG submitted its application later than expected — on Dec. 31, 2024, rather than in the third quarter of 2024 as originally planned — “leaving less time for the Commission to carry out its review,” the news release said.
At issue is whether or not the commission grants PSEG a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, which would allow them to construct the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project across northern Maryland. In a statement Thursday, the transmission company said that the power line “is a necessary infrastructure project to ensure grid reliability and affordability for Maryland ratepayers.”
“We have received the Public Service Commission’s procedural schedule, and our team is presently conducting a review to determine the appropriate next steps,” wrote William J. Smith, a PSEG spokesperson.
The project, a large transmission line planned to stretch 67 miles through rural parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, has attracted considerable opposition from residents, who argue that it will tear through natural lands — all in the name of shipping power through the heart of Maryland to a power station near the Virginia border.
In a statement Thursday, Stop MPRP,  a coalition formed to protest the project, applauded the schedule proposed by the PSC.
“PSEG asked for a rushed timeline that would have forced a decision by early 2026 — before complete studies of farmland, forests, wetlands, and community impacts could even be done,” the statement read. “The PSC rejected that approach.”
The coalition of property owners and other project opponents have also balked at PSEG’s attempts to conduct land surveys for the project, arguing that the surveys represent the company prematurely invoking eminent domain before it has the approval of Maryland regulators.
Federal courts have so far disagreed. A U.S. District Court judge in Baltimore has issued orders allowing PSEG to go onto the property of uncooperative landowoners to complete its surveys on hundreds of properties. Many landowners have appealed the decision in the ongoing case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the judge’s order, PSEG argued that a handful of landowners were continuing to resist the surveys, and requested back-up from U.S. marshals. But after most of those landowners pledged to allow surveyors onto their property, a judge ruled that the marshals would not be necessary.
The schedule released Thursday calls on PSEG to complete the surveys and submit an updated environmental review for the project by March. Involved parties, including landowners, Maryland’s ratepayer advocate and experts from the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, would file briefs with the PSC by September 2026, followed by two weeks of public hearings in the affected coiunties.
Evidentiary hearings would come in December 2026, and the parties would then submit post-hearing briefs by February 2027. The PSC would make its decision some time after reviewing those briefs, although it isn’t clear how long that could take. The schedule could be amended later for “good cause,” said Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the PSC.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0305-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 02:56:19.887459

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland legislative leaders were targeted at their homes by bomb threats Thursday, and the U.S. Naval Academy was briefly on lockdown, as tension lingered after the assassination Wednesday of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah.
Both House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) reported receiving bomb threats that were directed at their homes, not their state offices. The threats were deemed credible, officials said, but police ultimately did not find an actual threat.
The only injury reported was at the Naval Academy, where officials said a lockdown was imposed “out of an abundance of caution” after a nonfatal, accidental shooting of a midshipman on campus, which followed threats that had been received at the academy earlier in the day. The campus was put on lockdown shortly before 6 p.m. and remained so into the evening, No other injuries were reported.
Maryland was not alone. Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia were on lockdown Thursday after officials at those campuses received what one called “terroristic threats.”
Democratic legislative leaders in Rhode Island and New Mexico were also the targets of bomb threats, as was the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, which was closed by a bomb threat Thursday, according to news reports.
State lawmakers reconsider cost, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

None of the threats were linked directly to the killing of Kirk, who was gunned down during a public appearance before several thousand people Wednesday at Utah Valley University. But in most cases, authorities said the decided to be on the safe side, given the mood of the nation.
Ferguson said that after the killing of Kirk, and the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker in June and attempted killing of another, “it is clear that tragic political violence is on the rise.”
“Earlier today, the Baltimore Police Department received a bomb threat involving our family home. Thankfully, everyone is safe and secure,” said Ferguson, who went on to praise Baltimore City and Maryland State Police in a social media post.
That was echoed by Jones, who said authorities responded quickly to “a bomb threat at my home in Baltimore County … and determined that it was a non-credible bomb threat.”
“While such threats are violating, we can’t let them distract from the important work we do,” she said on social media. “Tonight, I will take time to care for my family and team and look forward to getting back to work tomorrow.”
As they did after the killing of Kirk, state leaders from both sides of the aisle reacted to the threats against Jones and Ferguson with denunciations of political violence and calls for civility in public life.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said on a Facebook post that Jones and Ferguson are “decent, respectful and when they can, consistent with their political beliefs, helpful and accommodating to me and my constituents.” He noted that Jones’ son died unexpectedly earlier this year and that Ferguson has a family with young children
“Calling in bomb threats to their residences or threatening them with violence of any form is despicable and does nothing to advance the conservative cause or better our nation’s future,” he wrote, adding that whoever made the threats should be “investigated, charged and punished significantly.”
Although he disagrees “strenuously” with much of what Democrats advance in Annapolis, Buckel said he would defend them “from violent and unhinged people on either side of the political divide who think that threats and violence are acceptable. Enough.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said on social media that his administration “takes threats like these seriously. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Violence of any type — including rhetoric and threats — will not be tolerated.”
Ferguson said the current violent political climate is “a poison whose inevitable outcome is the destruction of us all.”
“Somehow and someway, the current momentum of our political culture must move away from dehumanizing our ideological opponents and towards a recognition of our shared experiences in this world together,” he wrote. “We can and must be better than this.”

Knowledge could help prevent that, she writes.","There are simple steps that can help prevent a stillbirth, but Angela Moxley didn't learn that until she went through a stillbirth herself (Stock photo by John Fedele/Getty Images)The exam room was dark. In a moment I would replay in my mind hundreds of times, I watched the side of my obstetrician’s face, illuminated by the glow of the ultrasound screen. The nurse had called her in after she couldn’t find my baby’s heartbeat with the Doppler wand.
I had gone into the office first thing that morning because I hadn’t been feeling my baby move. He was due in just over three weeks. Truth be told, I wasn’t overly concerned. The iconic pregnancy book “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” didn’t have much to say about fetal movements. Everything I’d researched said that babies slow down at the end of pregnancy. The night before, my husband asked if he should come. I told him to go to work.
My doctor was upbeat at first, but her face changed. After several minutes of searching the ultrasound screen, she said, “There is no heartbeat.”
In that moment, I couldn’t comprehend what she said. This was my second child — no complications, the nursery was ready at home. Dumbfounded, I asked, “What does that mean?” Still staring at the screen, she softly replied, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” Reality shattered. I don’t remember much after, only sitting in the dark waiting for my husband, numb with disbelief, thinking, “I guess this was a stillbirth.”
Before it happened to me, I thought stillbirth was something that had ended back in the 1800s. No one had informed me how common it still is today, with 20,000 babies stillborn each year in the U.S. That’s one out of every 170 pregnancies — 65 stillbirths every single day. And now, my son, Luke, was one of them.

These basic facts about stillbirth opened the door to a hidden world of pregnancy loss, just beneath the myth that everything is safe after 12 weeks. Thrust into a quiet, nationwide community of grieving parents, I began to realize how everything I didn’t know about pregnancy had, in fact, hurt me and my child.
The next morning, I delivered Luke. The obstetrician — not my regular doctor — advised against an autopsy, saying, “Sometimes these things just happen.” But that wasn’t good enough. Luke’s death didn’t make sense, and we needed answers. The autopsy showed Luke was perfect — but his placenta was tiny, shriveled, and filled with blood clots.
We eventually connected with Harvey Kliman, a Yale researcher, who examined slides from Luke’s placenta and informed us that it was in the 0.01 percentile—smaller than 99.99 percent of all placentas. Luke himself was small but not overly so, and his placenta just couldn’t supply his body with enough nutrients and oxygen.
As it turned out, my immune system had attacked the placenta, a condition known as chronic histiocytic intervillositis. In normal pregnancies, Kliman explained, placentas are invisible to the mother’s immune system. No one yet understands why they are not in cases of CHI and similar conditions.
We learned about a tool called estimated placental volume (EPV), developed by Kliman, that helps measure placenta size during ultrasounds and flags when it’s too small — or too large. It’s simple and quick, yet still not widely used for reasons that remain frustratingly unclear. In Luke’s case, EPV almost certainly could have prompted an intervention that would have saved his life.
We also learned how critical it is to monitor fetal movements daily in the third trimester — slowdowns aren’t normal, even near delivery. Tracking can significantly reduce stillbirths, but no one ever emphasized this to me. Luke’s movements had been slowing for weeks, but without proper guidance, I didn’t think much of it.
I’ve heard providers avoid discussing adverse outcomes to avoid stressing mothers. It reminds me of my grandmother, who wasn’t told she was having twins in the 1940s. Over 70 years later, women are still being shielded from truths we deserve to know.
I wish we could reframe the conversation — not as fear, but as power. Parents deserve to know the risks of pregnancy and be trusted to advocate for themselves and their babies. Conditions like preeclampsia, placental disorders and cord compression are real and common. We deserve that knowledge. We deserve agency.
After Luke’s death, I used what I’d learned to protect my next pregnancy. I worked with a specialist to monitor the placenta using EPV and tracked every movement. My second son arrived healthy — but it was the most terrifying experience of my life, filled with constant fear.
No pregnancy should be a nail-biter. No one should have to hear their doctor say, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” No one should have to deliver a dead baby in the middle of the night. Women are smart and strong. We have tools to prevent stillbirth. Let us use them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sonogram-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 00:56:26.855314

“It’s clear to me this morning how much we have lost and how far we have fallen, and how hard it’s going to be to find our way back to each other,” said Attorney General William Tong, who lost a friend and classmate when the twin towers fell in lower Manhattan.
The message was not exactly on-brand for Tong, a Democrat who has not shied from opportunities for confrontation with President Donald Trump. He is a political pugilist, a lawyer more than willing to sue. Over everything from immigration to clean energy, Tong vows to make a fight.
“We have to find a way to have policy and political fights,” Tong said, going off topic at a press conference about his demand for documents from the WNBA related to the possible sale and relocation of the Connecticut Sun. “I use that word a lot, I know I do — fight.”
The rhetoric of politics is one of conflict and warfare, if more metaphorical than literal. But a sniper’s killing of Kirk, a charismatic 31-year-old evangelist of conservatism, as he spoke to a college audience of 3,000 in Utah is the latest in a series of attacks on political figures in the U.S.
Trump was the target of two assassination attempts. The residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was firebombed. Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked in their home. A state legislative leader in Minnesota and her husband were killed, and another lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded the same night.
Would Kirk’s death beget more violence?
“We’re sick, we’re sad, we’re angry, and we’re resolute, and we’re going to avenge Charlie’s death in the way Charlie would want it to be avenged,” conservative commentator Jesse Watters said on Fox. He did not explain how Kirk, a religious father of two, would want to be avenged.
On social media and cable, the recriminations over Kirk came fast and from all directions: The rhetoric of the left was at fault, or Kirk deserved his fate after mocking the attack on Pelosi’s husband and arguing that some shooting deaths must to be accepted rather than erode the right to bear arms. There were bipartisan efforts to tamp down such exchanges, nationally and in Connecticut.
“Nine-eleven was 24 years ago, and Charlie Kirk was assassinated less than 24 hours ago. I just want each and every one of us to look out for each other, be particularly kind,” Gov. Ned Lamont said. “There’s a lot of hateful rhetoric in the political marketplace. There’s some pretty tough rhetoric in the social media world, and this seems a pretty good day to be thoughtful, and particularly a time to look out for each other.”

His audience, manufacturers attending a conference at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, interrupted him with applause.
Which instinct would prevail? 
The young Democratic and Republican groups in Connecticut jointly denounced the murder Wednesday, a gesture that drew attention and praise. Their adult counterparts, Democratic Chair Roberto Alves and Republican Chair Ben Proto, followed suit late Thursday afternoon.
“Now is the time for public officials and advocates to step back and think about how rhetoric impacts and influences the people around us. As leaders of our respective parties and to the leaders of our government, it is imperative that we work together on this issue,” they said in a joint communique. “Violence is unacceptable whether against a Republican or a Democrat or any one of any political belief because we disagree with the opinions they hold.  We bring about change through debate, discussion, and at the ballot box.”
Like Tong and the governor, they noted the date.
“On this day, the anniversary of one of the greatest tragedies our nation has ever suffered, we are reminded that America is at its greatest when we work together,” they said “The task is not an easy one, but America is worth the effort.”
By day’s end, there was another bipartisan call for unity — from the spouses of governors from 30 states and territories. They offered themselves as close witnesses of the contempt heaped on America’s elected leaders, men and women they love.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful violence or rhetoric takes root,” the spouses wrote. “Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics. Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”
Annie Lamont, the first lady of Connecticut, was among the signers.
Politicians acknowledged, however, a collective crouch, a fear of what might come next. Would angry voices on social media drown out the more temperate pleas for peace and reflection and serve as fuel for more violence in a nation led by a president whose insistence on a stolen election helped inspire an assault on the U.S. Capitol?
Luiz Casanova, the chief of the state Capitol police, emailed legislative leaders and their chiefs of staff Thursday morning urging them to have their members to begin advising his office of any official events away from the Capitol campus.
“This information will allow us to assess potential security needs and coordinate with local authorities, where appropriate, to provide coverage and mitigate risk,” the chief wrote.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the orientation for new lawmakers includes advice on security — and social media. His suggestion on the latter is not to engage or inflame. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who aggressively promotes her views on social media, will not swear off positing, but she has grown wary about engaging in on-line debates.
“It’s intense right now,” said Gilchrest, who recently announced a campaign for Congress. “As someone seeking higher office, there is a fear.”
Lamont, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year, talked about a dire need to lower the temperature of American politics. 
There is no thermostat that can make that happen. 
Proto, the GOP state chair, signed the statement with Alves, but he was pessimistic in an interview earlier Thursday about taking down the heat, especially in the pundit class and on social media. 
“Do we need to turn it down? Yeah,” Proto said. “Do we have the ability to turn it down?”
Without mirth, Proto recalled the jokes in the earliest days of Twitter and Facebook about social media one day being the undoing of democracy.
“Well, we’re watching it,” Proto said. “We’re watching it happen.”
Kirk’s death showed signs of resonating more widely and loudly than some other recent acts of political violence. 
The attack was captured on video. He was upbeat and marveled at the size of the crowd, some of whom likely there to accept his invitation to debate his defense of gun rights and all things Trump, a gambit that added to his draw on college campuses. 
“He was doing the right thing when he was murdered,” said state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, who just began a run for governor. “He was using his words to reach out to people who disagree with him in places he was most likely to find them, college campuses.”
Kirk took questions. The last one in Utah was, “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”
His reply: “Counting or not counting gang violence?”
There was a single shot, Kirk fell and his audience fled in confused panic. 
Fazio, more or less a contemporary at 35, said he appreciated the column published in the New York Times by Ezra Klein, a liberal thinker. The headline was, “Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way.”
Causal observers on the left might dismiss Kirk, who began organizing as an 18-year-old college student, as just another right-wing provocateur, loyal to Trump and hostile to liberal causes, transgender rights among them.
“You can dislike much of what Kirk believed and the following statement is still true: Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” Klein wrote. “He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion. When the left thought its hold on the hearts and minds of college students was nearly absolute, Kirk showed up again and again to break it.”
Fazio said Kirk was a cultural phenomenon, drawing Gen Z to conservative causes — or inspiring liberal ones to oppose them. Proto agreed, saying, “He clearly was the instigator in getting younger Millennials and Gen Zers engaged in this conversation.”
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford, the leader of the Republican minority in the Connecticut House, said, “I was getting phone calls from my kids. This one really struck them.”
Tong offered public condolences.
“I want to say how sorry I am to the family of Charlie Kirk, how sorry I am for the loss of Charlie Kirk, to the people that loved and supported him. We should all be able to say that,” Tong said. “Everyone has a right to be safe.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-7.32.34-PM.png,,,2025-09-11 21:57:13.608705

(Photo provided by ConocoPhillips)A report published by the Alaska Department of Revenue last month says the state treasury will benefit far less from the new Willow oil project than previously estimated.
According to the department’s new estimate, Alaska’s state treasury will net $2.6 billion from the development between 2029, when Willow is expected to begin producing oil, and 2053, the end of its expected productive life.
That’s down 50% from $5.2 billion expected in a 2024 estimate, and from $6.3 billion forecast in a 2023 estimate.
Fairbanks writer Dermot Cole first noted the decline on his website.
Under all three estimates, Willow’s operator, ConocoPhillips, would receive more in state-paid tax credits than it generates the state in tax revenue.
Under Alaska’s current oil tax system, oilfield developers receive tax credits for their lease expenses — the cost of drilling for new oil or producing from an existing field. 
Those credits can be applied against production taxes elsewhere on the North Slope, or on oil from a new well, reducing the amount of money the state receives in taxes.
The new estimate lowers the expected price of oil and increases the cost of production across the North Slope, thus increasing the amount of tax reductions that could be applied to North Slope oil. It also takes into account a slightly different development plan that reduces expected production by 6%.
“Of these changes,” the department wrote in an emailed response to questions, “the increase in slope-wide lease expenditures had the greatest impact on state revenue.”
The department confirmed that the amount of tax reductions exceeds the new projected state revenue from Willow.
“Yes, in our Willow project analysis the total tax credits applied against tax liability over the duration of the analysis do exceed the revenue to the state from the Willow project over the duration of the analysis,” the department said by email. “This is true under both the 2024 and 2025 versions of the analysis. These credits do not represent cash out the door but rather an offset to taxes due based on the volume of oil produced.”
Willow is the largest oil and gas development to date on federal land within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, to the west of Prudhoe Bay. 
That area, believed to be home to significant oil reserves, is almost entirely untapped, and some state officials have said they believe that revenue from NPR-A would be particularly important as the state tries to bring expenses and revenue in line over future years.
The new estimate diminishes that hope. It predicts that peak production in 2030, Willow will be generating less than $300 million per year for the state treasury.
The state of Alaska isn’t the project’s only fiscal beneficiary. Under federal and state laws, 16.67% of production is paid in royalties to the federal government, with half of that money being redirected to the state, which uses it for grants to North Slope Borough communities.
This year, $31 million was split across four communities and the North Slope Borough.
Over the next 27 years, the state estimates those communities and the borough will share $3.1 billion. The borough itself will receive $1.2 billion from local property taxes. The federal government would receive $5.8 billion.
ConocoPhillips, the producer, would receive $10.3 billion, the state estimates. That’s up from $9.8 billion in the 2024 estimate and $9.9 billion in the 2023 one.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan joined fellow Senate Republicans Wednesday night in voting to set aside a budget amendment that would have compelled the U.S. Department of Justice to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The vote to table the amendment, stopping the Senate from considering it, was 51-49. 
All of the Senate’s Democrats voted in favor of the amendment, as did Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky.
The failure of either of Alaska’s Republican senators to vote for the amendment drew criticism from the Alaska Democratic Party.

Murkowski, talking by phone on Thursday, said the amendment, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, came as a surprise, and she voted against it for procedural reasons, not because she opposes the idea of a release.
“What Schumer did was nothing more than a political stunt,” Murkowski said.
In July, Murkowski and other members of a Senate budget subcommittee voted unanimously to amend a proposed appropriations bill to mandate that the U.S. Department of Justice compile a report on the activities of Epstein, a sex trafficker with extensive ties to rich and powerful people worldwide. Epstein died in jail while awaiting trial in 2019. 
The final text of the bill requires a report, but not the release of original documents in the possession of the federal government.
President Donald Trump campaigned on releasing the documents during last year’s presidential election, but this summer has since broken that campaign pledge, downplaying the case 
In February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had Epstein’s client list “sitting on my desk right now.” But in July the FBI announced in a memo that there was no “client list” and no more public information would be released. The announcement caused a public outcry, and the federal government still has not released the documents.
Trump’s social relationship with Epstein was well-documented, and this week, the Wall Street Journal published a copy of a birthday greeting Trump sent to Epstein in 2003. Trump has claimed the letter doesn’t exist, but it bears his signature.
The letter was released to the public after being obtained by U.S. House members investigating the Epstein case.
“I have been — I don’t know if it’s fair to say one of the rare Republicans — certainly a very early Republican on the Senate side who said, ‘Look, just, just release these Epstein files. Just get this stuff out there,” Murkowski said.
The appropriations bill with Murkowski’s preferred Epstein language would fund the U.S. Department of Justice and other commerce and science-related parts of the federal government. For that reason, it’s been nicknamed the “CJS bill.”
It has not yet come to a floor vote, and with senators hurrying to pass budget bills before the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, it isn’t clear when it will come up.
“Will we see the CJS as part of a floor package that could move through the Senate? It’s not impossible, but we are kind of running out of daylight,” Murkowski said.
Part of that uncertainty is due to Senate Democrats’ opposition to the overall contents of the bill. That opposition has slowed the bill’s progress.
Schumer’s amendment would have forced the Senate to debate the Epstein issue immediately, as part of the annual defense authorization bill now under debate.
In response to a request for comment, Sullivan’s office issued a written statement that also criticized Schumer’s amendment and defended his vote.
It said in part, “Senator Sullivan has repeatedly said that he believes the DOJ should release as much information as possible on Epstein’s horrific crimes, while protecting survivors. Chuck Schumer tried slipping the Epstein provision into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), knowing full well it would be stripped out as the bill went through the process, leaving no doubt he’s using Epstein’s atrocious crimes as a political pawn instead of focusing on building up our military in the NDAA, which Schumer has never shown any interest in doing.”
Murkowski said the amendment disrupted normal work on the defense bill and “threw a real wrench into the whole negotiated process that had really been moving along in a positive way.”
She said she believes Schumer brought up the Epstein issue because Senate Republicans are preparing to change the rules for the confirmation of Trump’s executive-branch nominations.
Ordinarily, the Senate approves uncontroversial nominees without a roll-call vote to make the process more efficient. Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, none of his nominees have been approved without a roll-call vote, an unprecedented change in the Senate, and one that has slowed both the Senate and the Trump administration’s confirmations.
In response, Senate Republicans are planning to change the Senate’s rules to allow the approval of multiple nominees with a single vote.
“I think he was trying to kind of change the narrative,” Murkowski said of Schumer’s proposed amendment. “I don’t think he was making much headway on his pushback on some of the nominations. And he made a decision that, I think, is going to be short-lived in its political fire. He really kind of poisoned the waters around here in terms of good-faith negotiations.”
The day after the vote, Alaska Democratic Party Chair Eric Croft released a statement, saying by email: “Just two months ago, Dan Sullivan called on the Department of Justice to release the documents to shine a light on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes. But last night, Dan Sullivan was a deciding vote to continue the cover-up and block an effort to force the DOJ to release the Epstein files. Instead of listening to Alaskans and the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Sullivan acted in his usual fashion – like a spineless politician who’s only loyal to his billionaire buddies. Alaskans and survivors deserve better.”
Sullivan faces re-election in 2026 and is running for another term in Congress.
To date, no Democrat has filed with the Alaska Division of Elections to challenge Sullivan. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Republican Christopher Miklos of Homer and Democrat Ann Diener of Fairbanks have filed forms necessary to begin fundraising.
The U.S. House, meanwhile, is close to having enough support to force a vote on the Epstein issue. While Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, opposes bringing up the topic, a bipartisan petition could override the Speaker if it has 218 signatures. As of Wednesday night, it had 217. Alaska’s lone member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Nick Begich, has not signed the discharge petition. His office did not respond to questions about his position on the Epstein issue and whether he will sign the petition.

Gilchrist is a resident of Detroit. He said in a statement issued via email and on social media that the threat has been cleared. He thanked law enforcement for their quick response, and for “keeping my family and our neighborhood safe.”
The incident occurred a day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at a university event in Utah.
“I know that people are on edge – it’s a scary time … in the midst of an escalating pattern of political violence in Michigan and in America,” Gilchrist said. “The purpose of this violence is to silence, intimidate, and eliminate people and their voices from our society. That won’t work on me. We cannot let this remain our reality.”

A message seeking comment and further details of the incident from the Michigan Department of State Police was not returned at the time of publication.
A spokesperson for the city of Detroit said that State Police were handling media inquires regarding the incident when asked if the city’s police and fire departments responded to Gilchrist’s home on Thursday.

Gilchrist, who is also a candidate for governor in 2026, added that the nation and Michigan “cannot tolerate political violence.” 
“We cannot excuse it. We cannot normalize it,” he said. “We have to push through this and do the work to do better. It’s not easy, but nothing important ever is. It’s up to us to dig deep and commit to ending violence and creating a safe, healthy society.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also commented on the incident on social media.
“I’m grateful that Lt. Governor Gilchrist and his family are safe after the bomb threat at his home today,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Let me be clear – political violence is unacceptable and has no place in Michigan. As Michiganders, we must reject all political violence and work towards a safer future.”
Reports of bomb threats were documented around the nation on Thursday, including against New Mexico’s Democratic Senate and House leaders, and numerous historically Black colleges and university campuses. Rhode Island State Police also said they were investigating bomb threats against top Senate Democrats on Thursday afternoon, however, the law enforcement agency said the emailed threats appeared to be hoaxes.

By Ryan Colasanti, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE Sports
MIDDLETOWN, Del. — After a grueling start against nationally respected opponents, the Middletown Cavaliers will once again defend Delaware’s football reputation when they host Our Lady of Good Counsel (Md.) this Friday at 7 p.m.
Delaware teams are a combined 5–6 against out-of-state competition this season, and Middletown accounts for two of those six defeats. Both losses came on the road—narrow setbacks against Ohio’s Bishop Watterson and New Jersey’s Red Bank Catholic by a combined margin of just six points. The Cavaliers’ defense shined in both contests, holding each opponent to just two touchdowns, but the offense fell just short in the closing minutes.
Middletown isn’t the only team carrying the state banner in these regional matchups. Last week, Salesianum hosted Pennsylvania powerhouse La Salle College High School in a hard-fought non-conference game on September 5 in Wilmington. The game was tied 14–14 at halftime, and Salesianum briefly grabbed a third-quarter lead with a 30-yard field goal to make it 17–14. But La Salle answered with two fourth-quarter touchdowns to pull away, sealing a 28–17 victory before a crowd of more than 1,000 fans. Strong defensive stands and strategic punting highlighted a contest that showed Delaware’s top programs are willing to test themselves against elite out-of-state foes.
Now Middletown returns home for its third and final out-of-state matchup of the year, looking to turn near-misses into a statement victory. The challenge will be steep. Good Counsel, a perennial power from the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, arrives undefeated at 2–0 after impressive wins over opponents from Florida and New Jersey. The Falcons reached last year’s WCAC championship game, defeating Gonzaga High School in the semifinals before falling to DeMatha.
Friday’s showdown offers Middletown a chance to reclaim momentum and give Delaware a signature win against a national-caliber program. With a stingy defense and home-field advantage, the Cavaliers will look to show they can finish what they’ve started in tight games against elite competition.
Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Middletown High School.  Delaware LIVE will have a report on the game on Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/e3910720-3486-45ce-96d5-37fa255d28a9.png,,,2025-09-11 20:56:37.467907

This […[...]","The possibility of removing four Snake River dams — Ice Harbor Dam, Lower Monumental Dam, Little Goose Dam and Lower Granite Dam — has long been a contentious one that has generally split along party lines. Shown is the Ice Harbor Lock and Dam, the first of four dams constructed as part of the Lower Snake River Project, authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945. (Photo by Columbia River System Operations EIS)Northwest states, tribes and environmental groups will resume suing the federal government over its hydroelectric dam operations in the Columbia River Basin that have harmed endangered native fish species. 
The move comes after the Trump administration in June withdrew from a “historic” deal made two years ago, when President Joe Biden was in office. This agreement called for putting long-running legal battles aside and investing in the restoration of endangered Columbia River fish runs. 
Behind the litigation are 10 environmental groups backed by Oregon, Washington and four Lower Columbia River tribes: The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe. 
Court fights over the dams had gone on for more than three decades before the pause. Now, they are back on, according to Amanda Goodin, an attorney with the environmental law group Earthjustice, which filed a motion Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oregon to end the multi-year pause on a 2021 lawsuit. 
“The Trump administration’s recent actions leave us with no choice but to return to court,” she said. 
On Oct. 8, Earthjustice will officially resume its lawsuit, spokesperson Elizabeth Manning said. 
Earthjustice’s plaintiffs include the National Wildlife Federation, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, Sierra Club, Idaho Rivers United, Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, NW Energy Coalition, Columbia Riverkeeper, Idaho Conservation League and Fly Fishers International, Inc.   
Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a statement that Oregon, too, was ready to resume legal action. 
“The federal government has put salmon and steelhead on the brink of extinction and once again broken promises to tribal partners. Extinction is not an option. Oregon will return to court to hold the federal government accountable and ensure these iconic fish runs have a future,” he said.
White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday. 
The 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement involved pausing active Snake River litigation for a minimum of five years while the federal government worked with tribes and states on a plan to advance recovery of native fish populations in the Columbia Basin. 
At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. 
The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
“These wild native fish are essential to tribal cultures and important to sport, commercial, and tribal fishing communities and economies throughout the Pacific Northwest.  We can and must do better,” said Bill Arthur, the director of the Sierra Club’s campaign to protect salmon in the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
The Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative included a roadmap for salmon and steelhead recovery, as well as steps to replace the energy, transportation, irrigation, and recreation services provided by the four lower Snake River dams so they could potentially be breached. 
The agreement was a way to increase salmon populations and fishing opportunities while improving public services, cutting taxpayer subsidies and meeting promises made to the tribes, according to Mike Leahy, senior director of wildlife, hunting and fishing policy for the National Wildlife Federation. 
In June, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum withdrawing the federal government’s support from the agreement, calling it “radical environmentalism” and saying completion of the restoration initiative would “be devastating for the region.” 
“It’s been disappointing to see the federal government overrule all the progress made in the region in favor of returning to court,” Leahy said. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement that renewing the lawsuit is necessary to protect natural resources, preserve fish runs, and hold the federal government responsible.
“President Trump walking away from these commitments presents a very real threat at a time when the fish are on the brink of extinction. It also continues our nation’s shameful legacy of broken promises to sovereign tribal nations that this partnership sought to repair,” she said.
While environmental groups agree that going back to court is an essential next step, they have committed to finding other ways to continue restoring the Columbia Basin while the lawsuits are ongoing. 
“We will nevertheless keep working with sovereigns and stakeholders across the Northwest to find real solutions to restore healthy, abundant salmon and bring our communities forward together,” said Columbia Riverkeeper Legal Director Miles Johnson.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iceharbor-dam-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 20:56:37.467907

(Screenshot from Arkansas PBS YouTube channel)Homeschooled children account for nearly 40% of those approved to participate in Arkansas’ Educational Freedom Account program this school year, according to figures presented to the State Board of Education Thursday.
Darrell Smith, assistant commissioner in the Office of School Choice and Parent Empowerment, told board members 18,420 of the 46,634 students approved for EFA participation this fall are homeschooled. The school choice office is part of the state Education Department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Arkansas’ public school student population by comparison is 474,337, according to the ADE Data Center.
Smith said the number of homeschooled students in the voucher program represents about 50% of the estimated homeschooled student population.
The Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall. Private school tuition is one of the allowable education expenses for students who receive the roughly $7,000 each the state will provide in the 2025-26 school year.
Since the state funds go to the student’s family, students in microschools also are eligible. Smith said 100 microschools are registered with the education department. Arkansas defines a microschool as “a tuition-based organization that serves a community of homeschool students, simultaneously in the same space, and that maintains responsibility for employing instructors or facilitators to provide part-time or full-time academic services.”
Smith told the state education board that 162 private schools and 28,214 private school students are approved EFA participants this academic year.
Asked how his office assures that schools don’t gouge parents with hefty tuition increases because of the state funding, Smith said his staff requires schools to provide a history of tuition increases and makes sure the schools have “a legitimate, rational reason” for any increases. His office also analyzes each school’s cost of educating a child to determine if any increases are in line with additional costs.
“We’re not just taking them at their word,” Smith said.
Under EFA program rules, the Department of Education may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.”
Smith said the department doesn’t give schools an upper limit or maximum percentage by which tuition can increase, adding that the policy is “one way we can hold private schools accountable.”
During his report on EFA participation, Smith said 17% of this year’s approved students are those with disabilities. Students with disabilities were among the first eligible when the program started in the 2023-2024 school year.
Another 17% of voucher recipients this year are children of veterans and first responders, he said. Children of law enforcement officers and active duty military each account for 2% of participants. 
Another 2% are students from public schools with “D” or “F” grades, according to a chart Smith presented. Students in foster care represent 4% of voucher recipients, and roughly 0.3% are homeless, the chart showed.

The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.[...]","A Bureau of Land Management office in Billings, Montana. The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)The federal government on Wednesday proposed rescinding a Bureau of Land Management rule that allows the department to consider conservation as part of its multi-pronged approach to federal land management.
The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.
The proposal drew immediate reactions from Montanans — with political leaders praising the reversal as helpful to energy production but conservation groups decrying it as another harm to public lands access.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are bringing back commonsense land management policies that will benefit Montana farmers, ranchers, and producers,” Montana U.S. Sen Steve Daines said. “The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing, and forest management. By rescinding the Public Lands Rule and unlocking more timber sales in Montana, we’ll be better able to manage our forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. President Trump is committed to Treasure State priorities and this is welcome news.”
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a department press release that the “Public Lands Rule” exceeded BLM’s authority and placed an “outsized priority” on conservation use of federal land, threatening energy development, grazing and recreation use.
“The previous administration’s Public Lands Rule had the potential to block access to hundreds of thousands of acres of multiple-use land – preventing energy and mineral production, timber management, grazing and recreation across the West,” Burgum said. “The most effective caretakers of our federal lands are those whose livelihoods rely on its well-being. Overturning this rule protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on.”
The Biden-era rule, formally the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, went into effect in spring of 2024, as a way to better define how the BLM approaches land management decisions. According to the final decision in the federal register, the rule helped clarify the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, by letting the department protect “intact, functioning landscapes;” offer restoration and mitigation leases, alongside grazing and extraction leases, to restore degraded habitats and ecosystems; and emphasize landscape health in decision making by utilizing science and data, including Indigenous Knowledge.
“The rule does not prioritize conservation above other multiple uses. It also does not preclude other uses where conservation use is occurring. Many uses are compatible with different types of conservation use, such as sustainable recreation, grazing, and habitat management. The rule also does not enable conservation use to occur in places where an existing, authorized, and incompatible use is occurring,” the final rule states.
The rule drew the ire of industry groups and politicians across the west, including Burgum, then-Gov. of North Dakota, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who along with the state of Idaho sued the federal government over the conservation rule. The BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land across Montana and the two Dakotas.
Conservation and recreation organizations, along with an overwhelming majority of the public that weighed in on the rule, supported allowing conservation and restoration to be considered more actively by federal land management agencies. According to an analysis by the Center for Western Priorities, 92% of more than 150,000 public comments supported the rule.
Outdoor-oriented policy and advocacy groups, including the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and the National Parks Conservation Association released statements opposing the change en masse on Wednesday.
“Every one of this administration’s public-lands policies is designed to sell out public access, recreation, clean water, and wildlife to boost corporate profits. ‘Multiple-use’ doesn’t mean that oil and gas corporations get to dictate what happens to our public lands,” said Aubrey Bertraim, federal policy director of Wild Montana. “Rolling back the Public Lands Rule is another way to cut out public input, undermine local management, and give industry and billionaires control of the places where we hike, hunt, fish, camp, and ride. Who cares if that hurts regular Montanans? It’s time to call this what it is: The latest move in a systematic approach to dismantle the public lands that support our way of life.”
The Outdoor Industry Association in a press release said the change would hurt economies and businesses that rely heavily on the outdoor recreation industry.
“America’s public lands are the engine of the $1.2 trillion outdoor economy and should be protected so future generations can continue hiking, climbing, and recreating in our most cherished places,” Outdoor Industry Association president Kent Ebersole said. “The rescission of the public lands rule would not only prevent accessible outdoor recreation on these vital lands but also hurt the small businesses and gateway communities that rely on it. The outdoor industry urges the administration to reconsider this decision and protect the landscapes that are vital to local economies, small businesses, and the outdoor recreation community.”
Many opponents of the Public Lands Rule claim it excluded grazing, extraction and recreation in favor of conservation, but the rule specifically states that it “does not prioritize conservation” above other uses, but puts them on equal footing in decision making. The text of the rule describes how conservation is an essential piece of the planning and management process. As an example, the rule states that a restoration lease could be paired with a grazing lease to allow tracts of public land to recover between periods of grazing.
But the Interior Department said rolling back the rule will also offer a more stable future for extraction and energy industry stakeholders concerned about litigation or permitting delays that could be brought forth under the rule.
“The rescission of the Public Lands Rule will eliminate unnecessary barriers to energy development and support the multiple-use mandate of the BLM by not prioritizing conservation over all other uses,” according to the Interior Department.
Rich Nolan, President and CEO of the National Mining Association, praised the move, saying the Biden had “unlawfully placed conservation above all else.
A screenshot of the BLM’s website on Sept. 11, 2025.
“This new rule reinstates the balance of federal land use intended by Congress, ensuring that our vast resources can meet today’s soaring energy needs and become the secure mineral supply chains for American industry,” Nolan said in a statement.
According to the BLM website, the policy on restoration and mitigation leasing has already been declared inactive as of Feb 27 of this year, following one of Trump’s executive orders from early in his term.

He discussed his “50 by 50” generation plan to increase West Virginia’s energy capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050 – an increase from the 15 gigawatts it currently produces. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey unveiled a new comprehensive energy plan for West Virginia on Wednesday, which will largely rely on doubling down on and increasing power generated from the state’s nonrenewable energy sources like coal and natural gas.
The plan — dubbed the “50 by 50” generation plan by Morrisey — aims to see the state increase its power capacity from the current 15 gigawatt generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. Morrisey said increased generation is necessary so the PJM — the massive power grid network that West Virginia feeds into — can meet estimated future demands.
Morrisey noted that, by 2045, it’s estimated that there will be a 70 gigawatt increase in peak load demand from the PJM, which serves West Virginia along with 12 other states. Meanwhile, he said, it’s projected that about 40 GW of the PJM’s generating capacity may be retired by 2030.
“Within the next 20 years PJM will likely need 110 GW of new generation capacity just to keep pace with demand growth and aging retirements. Currently, very few states within PJM can produce enough power to meet their own needs, much less export power to other states. West Virginia is one of those states,” Morrisey said. “[W]hile West Virginia is a national leader in per-capita electricity exports, we lack the existing generation capacity to meet future needs.”
To reach his goal of 50 gigawatt generating capacity, Morrisey said the state will prioritize growing its “stable baseload generation over renewables” through continued reliance on coal and natural gas as well as nuclear energy. 
“Baseload generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear are critical to our way of life,” Morrisey said. “It provides a stable backbone to the grid, ensuring there is always a dependable supply of electricity.”
West Virginia currently has no nuclear energy developments operating. In 2022, however, lawmakers passed a bill repealing the state’s previous ban on nuclear energy, paving the way for future generation. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, West Virginia has five “multiple unit small modular reaction plants” that are scheduled to be in operation by 2025. Appalachian Power, the state’s largest electric company, is currently in the process of creating a small modular reactor in Virginia.
Morrisey said that he not only wants to keep the state’s current coal plants operational, but he also plans to explore options for newly created coal-generated power plants.
“West Virginia has numerous coal plants that have powered this country for decades. We need these plants to remain operational,” Morrisey said. “… We will never turn our backs on our existing coal plants and we will work with the federal government to pursue new coal-fired generation.”
Most of the state’s existing coal plants were commissioned decades ago and upgraded since then to remain operational. No new large coal-fired power plants have been commissioned in West Virginia or elsewhere in the United States in over 10 years.
Morrisey said West Virginia’s coal industry has been a “cornerstone of electricity generation” and has helped ensure “affordable and reliable power” in the state.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
National security and the race for artificial intelligence, data center developments
Morrisey’s remarks heavily focused on threats facing the U.S. from China, Russia and elsewhere. Namely, he said that “energy is being used by our adversaries to threaten the American way of life.”
“China, Russia and Iran are three of the largest energy producing countries in the world and three of our nation’s biggest adversaries,” Morrisey said. “They are coordinating diplomatically, militarily, and economically to weaken American influence and build an alternative global order.“
Specifically, Morrisey said, the country needs to ensure it is competing with and protecting itself from China, which is a massive coal-fired power generator and “dominates” mineral supply chains.
“China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of critical data to China instead of to the United States,” Morrisey said. “America can either find a way to dramatically increase its power production, or China will eclipse our nation in a technological battle that will undermine our national security.”
Data centers, Morrisey continued, are central to this “battle.” He said the state has partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with “crafting our data center development strategy.”
But several data centers are already proposed to be developed in West Virginia. Permits for some have already been approved. Several of these data centers will be powered by “microgrids,” which operate separate from existing utilities. This was made possible during the 2025 legislative session, where lawmakers passed House Bill 2014 allowing these microgrids to be established.
That legislation also included language to stop localities from enforcing zoning laws and other ordinances — like ones for noise and light pollution — against the developments.
From Tucker County to the state’s Southern Coalfields, residents have started organizing in an attempt to stop these developments. They’re worried about how they will impact their communities through unhealthy emissions and massive water consumption, which they fear will threaten their own water supplies.
Morrisey said Wednesday that the state needs to “ensure” that the “rapid innovation and demand” from data centers does not “negatively impact” residents. He did not outline what those negative impacts would be or how they would be avoided. 
Environmental advocates decry lack of renewable energy in state strategy
While Morrisey said that every kind of energy needs to be embraced in order to meet electricity demand, he said the place for renewable energy — like solar and wind — is limited.
He cited the state’s lack of “flat land” and a study showing that West Virginia, on average, does not have a high number of “annual sunlight hours.”
Solar power, generally, does not need year-round sunlight to create power. When electricity is generated from solar, it can be stored in batteries for use on overcast days and at night.
Shawn Phillips, with the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said it was insulting to hear Morrisey call West Virginia’s energy “affordable” and coal “common sense” since power bills in the state continue to climb. Meanwhile, largely under Republican leadership, West Virginia has refused to invest in or grow its renewable energy sector.
Just this year, lawmakers proposed legislation to prohibit all wind power projects, establish new taxes for electricity from wind and solar projects, limit the number of wind projects allowed in a year, eliminate all subsidies for renewable energy projects, and increase taxes on wind turbines.
Current policies ban community solar, which allow residents and businesses to join a nearby solar project and lower their electricity prices from utilities. Bills to repeal this ban have repeatedly failed at the Legislature.
Phillips said that if West Virginia wants to make energy affordable and reliable, the state needs to explore its options with renewable energy forms.
“Coal is an unreliable fuel — it’s aging, breaking down, and driving prices up,” Phillips said. “Renewables are the fastest, cheapest, and most dependable sources we can build today. Fossil fuels don’t just drain wallets — they poison our air and water. Propping them up means West Virginians pay twice: once on their bills, and again with their health.”
Jillian Welsh, communications coordinator for the state Environmental Council, echoed Phillips’ points. If energy affordability is the goal, Welsh said, then “renewables have to be front and center.”
“Wind, solar and [battery] storage are the fastest, cheapest resources to build, and leaving them out makes [Morrisey’s] plan obsolete on day one,” Welsh said. “Chasing ‘50 by 50’ by tripling coal, gas and nuclear is a recipe for higher bills and dirtier air — not progress.”
Welsh noted that Morrisey did not once mention the growing impacts of climate change in the region or any move to cut carbon emissions, which can threaten residents’ health and contribute to climate change.
West Virginia is already home to the ninth highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the nation, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. As a whole, the state was the 12th highest emitter nationally for greenhouse gases in 2023.
Currently proposed natural gas power plants would contribute more emissions into the atmosphere. In Mingo County, two proposed methane-powered plants would become the state’s third and fourth largest power plants once built, behind only the John E. Amos plant and the Harrison Power Station. Those power plants, if approved, are planned to power two data centers and an ammonium plant. 
As they would operate as microgrids, local governments would have no say or power over their operations.
“Communities get no say over whether they want massive new plants in their backyards. There’s barely a nod [in Morrisey’s address] to protecting air, water and health — and not a word on mountaintop removal,” Welsh said. “And while the governor warns about China, he ignores the fact that China is leading a solar revolution that’s making energy cheaper. At the same time, West Virginians are being told to foot the bill for outdated, polluting power.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington state Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu will retire from the bench at the end of this year.
Yu, appointed in 2014, told fellow justices Thursday afternoon after informing Gov. Bob Ferguson in a letter last week. 
Ferguson will appoint a new justice, his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
“It is not an easy decision to step away,” she wrote in the letter. “I have had the good fortune of serving the people of our great state as a judge for 25 years and have cherished every single moment of such service.”
Washington Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu announced Thursday she will retire at the end of the year. (Photo courtesy of the Administrative Office of the Courts)
Yu highlighted the time she’s spent “mentoring and teaching those younger than me to embrace life, lead, and to make a difference.”
“They cherish the rule of law, and they will defend and protect the courts that I love so deeply,” she said.
Chief Justice Debra Stephens called Yu “a dynamic leader,” praising her work as a mentor of new lawyers and a champion of racial justice through her leadership on the Washington State Minority and Justice Commission.
“She has served the people of Washington with passion, intellect and boundless energy,” Stephens said in a statement.
Ferguson said in a statement that during her time on the bench, Yu has demonstrated her commitment to respect, dignity and fairness for all.” 
“Her legacy is in bending Washington state further toward justice,” he said.
Trailblazing career
Yu was raised in Bridgeport, a South Side neighborhood in Chicago, by immigrant parents. Her mother came from Mexico and her father from China. She is the first in her family to graduate from college, according to her official biography.
When Gov. Jay Inslee appointed her to the state Supreme Court on May 16, 2014, Yu became the first Asian, the first Latina and the first member of the LGBTQ community to serve on the court. She went on to win elections in 2014, 2016 and 2022.
Before reaching the state’s high court, the trailblazing Yu had etched her place into state history.
At midnight on Dec. 9, 2012, when same-sex couples could begin to legally marry in Washington state, several lined up outside a Seattle courtroom to have Yu, then a King County Superior Court judge, preside over their nuptials.
Sarah and Emily Cofer of Snohomish County were first up.
“Judge Yu was warm and welcoming. She presided over the ceremony with comfort and joy that made it feel like a personal event even in such a public setting,” Sarah Cofer recounted in a biography of Yu in the “Love, Equally” exhibit marking the history of marriage equality in Washington.
Yu worked more than 14 years as a trial court judge in King County Superior Court after serving as deputy chief of staff to former King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.
In her letter to Ferguson, Yu said personal events over the past year “have shed a new light on how I might want to spend the next 25 years of my life.”
Yu, in a phone interview Thursday, said two events catalyzed her decision. Last year, an early detection of breast cancer led to two surgeries and she is now “completely healthy.” Then, in March, Justice Susan Owens passed away at age 75, just three months after retiring from the bench.
“I thought, life just can’t end this way for me. I want to travel. I want to teach. I want to write,” she said. “Life is a precious gift.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/washington-state-temple-of-justice-supreme-court--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 19:57:57.363547

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)HOPE — Hempstead County health care providers and law enforcement officers told Arkansas lawmakers Thursday they need more money in order to meet Southwest Arkansas’ mental and physical health care needs.
Pafford Health Systems, a locally-owned ambulance service that serves 23 Arkansas counties and parts of three bordering states, purchased the local hospital a year ago after its previous corporate owner filed for bankruptcy.
In addition to Hempstead County, the Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center serves three counties that do not have hospitals: Lafayette, Nevada and the southern portion of Pike. If financial strain closed the hospital, it would leave “a big hole in Southwest Arkansas,” Chief Administrative Officer Shelby Brown said.
“Right now, we have more money going out than we have money coming in,” Brown told the Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee, which met Thursday morning at the hospital.
Brown and Republican Rep. Dolly Henley, who represents Hope and serves on the House Public Health committee, both said they have asked Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her staff to visit the hospital and help them come up with financial solutions. Sanders, who was born in Hope, has not yet visited the facility, Brown and Henley said.

The Legislature distributed nearly $60 million in federal pandemic relief funds to 17 rural hospitals deemed eligible for the aid between 2022 and 2024. Hope’s hospital, then called Wadley Regional Medical Center, did not receive aid from this subset of COVID-19 relief funds.
Medicare and Medicaid make up roughly a combined 66% of the hospital’s payers, Brown said, and many “people who are really at risk see us as their primary care provider.”
The hospital gets paid $12 per Medicaid patient who uses its emergency room for non-emergent primary care, she said.
She also said Southwest Arkansas Regional has applied to be a critical access hospital, a federal designation for facilities located no less than 35 miles from other hospitals and maintaining no more than 25 beds. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsidizes critical access hospitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare recipients.
If CMS approves Southwest Arkansas Regional’s application, it will have to reduce its inpatient beds from 48 to 25. The hospital will also be required to retain intensive care patients for no longer than an average of 96 hours.
Brown said she and other hospital administrators considered seeking rural emergency hospital status, which draws more federal funds to rural hospitals if they reduce or eliminate inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment.
“But if we did that, you have to get rid of all your acute beds, and the community decided that’s not where we need to be,” Brown said.
The Hempstead County Quorum Court and the Hope board of directors each passed resolutions in June 2024 pledging $1,000,000 to support the hospital in 10 installments of $100,000 per month.

 More services needed

After the committee meeting, Brown and Pafford employees led lawmakers on a brief tour of the facility, including the intensive care unit and a Pafford ambulance.
The ICU is technically separate from the hospital and is owned and operated by Pafford, Brown said. The hospital also has a geriatric psychiatric ward.
The hospital wants to add services, such as colonoscopies, “but we need to get our feet planted and financially stable” first, Brown said.
About 25% of local ambulance calls result in a patient refusing to be transferred to a hospital, and this creates expenses with no attached revenue stream, said Pafford marketing director Suzy Barham and Arkansas Ambulance Association President Amanda Newton.
In addition to becoming a critical access hospital, Southwest Arkansas Regional is also in the process of becoming a nonprofit. This will help repay some of the money the Pafford family has invested in keeping the hospital afloat, Brown said, and it will make the hospital eligible for the federal 340B discount prescription drug pricing program.
Lawmakers and local law enforcement officers said another potential revenue stream for the hospital would be mental health services if it had the funding to provide such care. About 20% of county jail inmates in Miller County, Hempstead County’s neighbor to the west, need mental health treatment, Miller County Sheriff Wayne Easley said.
Texarkana, Arkansas, is the Miller County seat and no longer has a hospital, leaving Southwest Arkansas Regional as the closest facility. Texarkana Police Chief Ed Chattaway and Hope Police Chief Kimberly Tomlin both said Hope’s hospital could be a good point of intervention for people whose mental health struggles attract police attention.

“If they aren’t breaking the law and they’re in that limbo spot before something happens, sometimes you have to walk away from people that you know need something,” Tomlin said.
Arkansas has three crisis stabilization units — located in Little Rock, Fort Smith and Jonesboro — established in 2017 as alternatives to incarceration for people with substance use and mental health issues.
Sen. Missy Irvin, a Mountain View Republican and the Senate chair of the Public Health committee, said the units are underfunded and mental health resources need a stronger support system.
“We have to have a collaboration and a partnership to go back and see what’s working, where it’s working and how it’s working,” Irvin said. “It’s going to require a commitment and spend from the Legislature, in my opinion, and I think it’s a worthy spend.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shelby-Brown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 19:57:57.363547

She, along with 34 other first spouses across the U.S., signed on to a letter dated Sept. 11 to call on Americans to “listen more, eliminate hate and find connection and healing” after highly publicized acts of political violence have rocked the country within the last year.
Manhunt for Charlie Kirk shooter: Rifle found, person of interest photos released

The call comes one day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem and three months after Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband was shot and killed by an assailant in their home. That attacker also shot Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, but they survived.
A shooter also fired on U.S. President Donald Trump, and a bystander was killed, at a campaign rally in July 2024 in Pennsylvania before the attacker was shot and killed by the U.S. Secret Service.
“As First Spouses of states and territories across the country, we are in a unique position to both witness and experience the contempt that has permeated our culture,” the first spouses wrote. “Today, we stand together — across political backgrounds — to condemn political violence of every kind.”
The first spouses wrote that they are committed to seeing every American “as a person with inherent dignity and worth,” and that the U.S. system of democracy and unity as a country depends on Americans finding common ground with one another.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful rhetoric or violence takes root. Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics,” the group wrote. “Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)South Dakota public university enrollment this fall is 36,091 students, exactly the same as last fall, according to numbers released Thursday by the South Dakota Board of Regents.
Enrollment dropped for two universities and increased by less than 3% at four others:

Black Hills State University in Spearfish increased by 2.36% to 3,425 students.
Dakota State University in Madison grew by 1.8% to 3,842 students.
Northern State University in Aberdeen grew by 0.84% to 3,739 students.
South Dakota Mines in Rapid City decreased by 1.47% to 2,541 students.
South Dakota State University in Brookings grew by 0.61% to 12,139 students.
University of South Dakota in Vermillion decreased by 2.02% to 10,405 students.

System-wide enrollment peaked at 36,662 in 2017, and no year since then has equaled that mark.


The numbers could be a sign of the “2025 cliff” that officials have been fearing, attributed to a lower birth rate during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. There will be a 10% decline in high school graduates nationally from 2025 to 2037, Board of Regents Executive Director Nathan Lukkes told lawmakers last year.
Despite the flat trend overall, more South Dakota high school graduates are pursuing higher education in the state than in recent years, Lukkes said in a news release. South Dakota student enrollment increased this fall to 22,410, a 1% increase over last year, according to system data.
State university enrollment grows by 5% as ‘2025 cliff’ looms

Black Hills State University reported the largest increase in student enrollment this fall by percentage and raw numbers, with 79 more students. It also reported its largest freshman class since 2019 at 500 enrollees, and a 58% increase in Native American enrollment, at 142 students.
South Dakota State University reported the highest percentage increase in full-time enrollment. Dakota State University’s enrollment is a record high for that school, and Northern State University’s enrollment is the highest since at least 1998.
Despite the decline in enrollment at USD, the university reported enrollment at its Sioux Falls campus increased by 19.1%. The university expanded degree programs to the campus in recent years, including its masters in business administration program and a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. The university recently announced that it will move its medical school to Sioux Falls.

The Turning Point USA founder was speaking at an outdoor event with over 3,000 people in attendance when he was shot at Utah Valley University, according to the Utah News Dispatch. Authorities have not arrested Kirk’s shooter as of Thursday evening.
Kirk, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump known for traveling the country and holding debates, has been credited with mobilizing young GOP voters and bringing a more populist conservative movement into the mainstream. His death sparked bipartisan rebukes against political violence nationwide.
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

The attack came at a time of heightened attention to political violence in the United States Then-Republican nominee Trump survived an assassination attempt last summer, with a bullet grazing his ear, while he was campaigning in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were the victims of arson when the Governor’s Mansion was set aflame while they were asleep. And most recently, former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman was assassinated in her home, while another state senator was gravely wounded in a related attack the same night.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote after Kirk’s death was announced that “America witnessed a cowardly act of evil,” and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton wrote that the act of violence was “heartbreaking.” Sanders said the U.S. was better off because of Kirk, 31.
Many officials characterized the shooting as an assassination, and offered their prayers for Kirk’s wife and children.
“The senseless and evil assassination of Charlie Kirk casts a sad and painful shadow over America tonight,” wrote Attorney General Tim Griffin. “My prayers are with Charlie’s beautiful family — his wife and his two young children — all those who were close to him and our Nation.”
Arkansas Speaker of the House Rep. Brian Evans of Cabot also offered prayers for Kirk’s family — and the university students who witnessed the shooting.

I’m deeply saddened and appalled by the news of Charlie Kirk’s passing and heartbroken by the violence today. My prayers are with his family and with the students who witnessed this horrific attack.
— Brian S. Evans (@AR_HouseSpeaker) September 10, 2025

The chair of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, retired Col. Marcus Jones, released a statement expressing hope that the shooter would be caught quickly.
“Political violence is reprehensible and wrong. Every American should be able to state their opinion — no matter what that opinion is — without facing violence,” Jones wrote. “Even and especially when we disagree with someone, we must all defend their right to use their voice.”
Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, referenced the shooting during a prayer she led at Thursday’s Legislative Joint Auditing-Counties and Municipalities hearing, saying the nation was in a “time of turmoil.” She asked God to “help us turn down the rhetoric and help us resolve to listen to others.”
“As each person, no matter the political spectrum, their ideology, their side of an issue, they have a right in our country and a sacred right to be able to speak their words and to express their views,” she said.
Rep David Ray, R-Maumelle, wrote on the social media platform X that the incident was “deeply disturbing and horrific.”
“There’s never an excuse for political violence, regardless of where it comes from. That’s why we have laws, rules, & a constitution: to settle our differences without banana Republic-type atrocities. God help us,” Ray wrote.
Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, wrote Kirk’s death pained him deeply, and that he had been “such a gift to this generation.”
“We don’t kill people because we disagree with them. Charlie was one of the last bastions of civil discourse, and they killed him for it,” Rose wrote in a separate post.

Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, had sharper words, using the moment to call for “Commonsense, bipartisan actions to reduce gun violence.”

The Turning Point USA founder charted the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
The post Charlie Kirk influenced Wyoming politics. A local GOP megadonor helped launch his career. appeared first on WyoFile .","When Charlie Kirk was a teenager, he had a chance encounter with Foster Friess, the late Wyoming businessman and Republican megadonor. 
They met in Tampa, Florida, at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Months before, Kirk had formed a new organization to recruit and organize young conservatives on college campuses, naming it Turning Point USA. 
In Tampa, Kirk spotted a man in a cowboy hat at the convention and recognized him as Friess, the New York Times reported earlier this year. 
“I ran into him in a stairwell,” Kirk posted on X in November. “A literal elevator pitch when I was 19.” 
The pitch worked. After the encounter, Friess wrote Kirk’s organization its first $10,000 check. 
Before Friess’ death in 2021, the two men and their families developed a friendship that would help launch Kirk’s career into the conservative stratosphere. At 31, Kirk was among the most influential young Republicans in the United States.
“Foster knew then that Charlie would move the culture and change history… and he did!” Lynn Friess, Foster’s widow, said in a statement posted on X. 
“He’s gone to be with the Lord. We are devastated by this news,” she wrote. 
Charlie Kirk, Lynn Friess and Foster Friess are pictured together. (@fosterfriess/X) 
By the time Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, he had built one of the most high-profile conservative brands in the country, amassed a social media following in the millions and become a trusted ally to President Donald Trump. 
He’d also helped to set the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
“I’ve known Charlie since before his rise to prominence — a salt-of-the-earth man with a beautiful family, driven by an unwavering commitment to his beliefs,” Wyoming Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said in a statement. 
“My heart aches for his loved ones, his wife and two beautiful children, and my prayers are with them during this unimaginable loss,” Biteman wrote. “This act of political violence is a wound to our nation, and we must stand united against such hatred. Let us honor Charlie’s memory by fostering respectful dialogue over division, and peace over violence.”
Other Wyoming officials echoed Biteman in their own statements, including Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. 
Additionally, the Wyoming Republican Party called for civil discourse and the Wyoming Democratic Party denounced political violence. 
“In the midst of this tragedy, it is important that we reaffirm the right of all to express their views freely, especially on college campuses, as Mr. Kirk did recently at UW,” University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel said in a statement. 
In April, Kirk spoke on campus after UW’s Turning Point USA student chapter invited him. The event sold out, and Kirk spent the majority of his time on stage debating students, according to The Laramie Reporter. And despite concerns that Kirk’s visit could grow unruly — as Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman’s town hall in Laramie did the month prior — no such disruptions occurred.

It was Kirk’s first time speaking on UW’s campus, but not his first visit to Wyoming. 
In 2020, he addressed Republicans at their convention in Gillette, warning them the state could soon be run by Democrats if conservatives didn’t go on the offensive. 
That same year, Kirk got involved in Teton County’s local elections via attack ads, which were unusual for the community at the time. The three candidates endorsed in the mailers also condemned them. 
In 2023, he visited Teton County for the local GOP’s annual fundraiser. A few months later, Kirk weighed in on one of Wyoming’s more high-profile court cases in recent memory. 
After a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against a UW sorority for admitting a transgender woman, Kirk said the student should be imprisoned and he encouraged members of Kappa Kappa Gamma to harass her. 
“These girls should bully this freak,” he said on the Aug. 29, 2023 episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, a popular podcast. 
Not far from the sorority house, a group of about 100 students gathered on campus Wednesday evening to mourn Kirk. They stood together and prayed, some crying, others embracing one another. 
“I met [Kirk] like three years ago, and I was really struggling running this thing because people just didn’t like Turning Point all that much,” Gabe Saint, president of the organization’s UW chapter, told WyoFile at the vigil. 
“And now we’re way more popular, and it’s because of a lot of the stuff Charlie’s done, and how he’s supported us,” Saint said. 
Last December, Saint was awarded Turning Point USA’s student patriot of the year award in Phoenix.

“Spotting an inactive TP USA chapter on campus, [Saint] single-handedly revived it, transforming a four-member club into a powerhouse organization, hosting record-breaking events and reshaping university policy,” Kirk said at the awards event. 
Kirk credited Saint’s leadership with influencing the Wyoming Legislature’s decision to defund diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the university. 
“The sad thing is, like, Charlie, was he hardcore in a lot of his beliefs? Absolutely,” Saint told WyoFile. “But he did it the democratic way by having discourse. And he was shot for doing it the democratic way.” 
While Saint may be responsible for Turning Point’s growing popularity on UW’s campus, it was another student who started the chapter in 2017. 
“At the time, I did not realize how much starting that chapter would shape the rest of my life,” Jessie Rubino said in a statement sent to WyoFile. 
As the Wyoming state director for the State Freedom Caucus Network, it’s Rubino’s job to read and analyze legislation to then guide Wyoming Freedom Caucus members on how they should vote. In 2024, the group won control of the House — the first time a state freedom caucus controlled a legislative chamber in the U.S. 
That work and so much of Rubino’s life “can be traced back to the small group of conservatives who met Thursday nights in the student union in Laramie — all thanks to Charlie,” she wrote. 
She met her closest friends and the man who would become her husband, Joe, “through campus activism (and the Lord’s good hand),” she wrote. Joe Rubino is now a top official in the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office.
“I became connected with the most amazing patriots in Wyoming and across the nation. There are thousands of other people just like me who have been blessed by Charlie’s work,” Jessie Rubino wrote. “I am sickened and saddened, but assured that Charlie is in paradise with the Lord today.”

University Chancellor Glenn Boyce released an official statement on the university’s social media pages Thursday stating that an unnamed employee was terminated after Kirk was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on the Utah Valley University campus. 
“The comments run completely counter to our institutional values of civility, fairness and respecting the dignity of each person,” the statement said. “We condemn these actions and this staff member is no longer employed by the university.” 
The university did not identify the employee in its statement. It’s just one instance among many Thursday where educators at schools across the country were criticized or fired for their comments about Kirk after his death. 
The employee referred to actions that “reimagined Klan members like Kirk” have taken, ending the post with, “So, no, I have no prayers to offer Kirk or respectable statements against violence.”
Mississippi State Auditor Shad White, a vocal critic of what he calls “woke” initiatives in higher education, shared a post on X that may have alluded to an employee at the university and what was re-shared on social media. 
“To Ole Miss, did an Ole Miss employee just repost this insane reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder? Answer,” White wrote. 

The attached photos to White’s post names Lauren Stokes, executive assistant to the vice chancellor of development at the university. She also has been publicly identified in other media. Stokes could not be reached for comment.
White’s post also shows the alleged reshared post that reads, ““For decades, yt [white] supremacist and reimagined Klan members like Kirk have wreaked havoc on our communities, condemning children and the populace at large to mass death for the sake of keeping their automatic guns.”
Neither university officials nor White’s office responded to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
Kirk was scheduled to appear at Ole Miss on Oct. 29, part of his “The American Comeback tour,” sponsored by his organization. 
It’s another high profile instance where White has used his platform to call out university employees and higher education leaders in the state for their beliefs he says are antithetical to conservative policy. 
In 2020, he pushed for a University of Mississippi professor to be fired after he stopped going to work for two weeks to protest racial inequality. More recently, he’s criticized Tommy Duff, former IHL board member, for his involvement in IHL policies surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion and other topics.  Both are considering a run for governor.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06180031/OleMiss1-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-11 18:57:21.278544

The state transportation agency has proposed making up a $7.5 million gap in its current budget with cuts to construction projects and “position management savings.”

The Vermont Agency of Transportation released a plan this week to cut $7.5 million from its 2026 fiscal year budget — including more than $2 million in “position management savings” — after state economists lowered revenue projections in July by the same amount.
On Wednesday, the agency sent what’s known as a rescission plan to two Vermont legislative committees tasked with overseeing state spending when lawmakers aren’t in session. Those are the Joint Transportation Oversight Committee and the Joint Fiscal Committee. The latter must approve the agency’s plan before it goes into effect.
The committees are scheduled to meet Sept. 17 and 18, respectively, during which they are set to discuss the plan and hold public hearings on it. The agency was obligated to come up with budget cuts after state economists, at a July meeting with top lawmakers, downgraded previous estimates for how much money the state could expect to bring in to support its transportation system.

At that meeting, economists pointed to lower-than-expected recent revenue from taxes on motor vehicle purchases and from fees collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Over the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June, those receipts saw a sharp drop-off from the state’s initial projections. In the first month of the current fiscal year, this past July, tax revenue from vehicle purchases again underperformed against economists’ expectations, according to the latest state data.
Meanwhile, the state has long faced a decline in gasoline tax revenue as cars have become more fuel-efficient, and as more people purchase electric vehicles. Lawmakers added a new annual fee on electric vehicles last year aimed at curbing some of the impact.
On Wednesday, the transportation agency listed about a dozen line items from its 2026 budget it is looking to cut. 
The largest, according to the list, is $2,254,000 in projected “position management savings,” though the agency did not elaborate. Another $2 million would be saved by delaying a garage project in Springfield, while reductions in tree trimming, mowing and culvert maintenance would together save $915,000, the list states. 
Delaying a rail platform project in Rutland would save another $500,000, while another $230,000 in savings would come from suspending agency employees’ travel and participation in conferences, the list states.
Joe Flynn, the state’s transportation secretary, declined to provide more detail about the plan before it is presented to lawmakers, he said through a spokesperson Thursday.
One of the legislators who will weigh in on the plan next week is Rep. Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House Transportation Committee. Walker said Thursday the fact that budget cuts are on the table highlights a need for major changes to how the state’s transportation system is paid for.
He said he does not like the idea of cutting any costs lawmakers have already deemed important enough to budget for, such as maintenance to keep roads safe. With transportation revenues failing to keep pace with expenses, lawmakers need to have serious conversations about new ways to pay for key infrastructure, Walker said.
This year, for instance, legislators agreed to halt an annual transfer of about $20 million from the state’s transportation coffers to its general fund for use by the Vermont State Police. But that’s not going to be enough, he warned.
“We’re going to have to close this gap, and all things need to be on the table to do that,” Walker said.

The Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park has long offered a true wilderness experience, with its undeveloped shorelines and remote campsites reachable only by paddling. But after years of back and forth between state officials and the owners of the dam that creates the reservoir, the future of this site still looks uncertain.
Before the state could consider acquiring the facility, it needed a comprehensive picture of the conditions of the Green River Dam and dike and the operational and maintenance costs. A long-awaited study commissioned by lawmakers provided those answers when it was released two weeks ago.
The hydro facility was built in 1947, which raised concerns about whether it would need expensive structural updates. The report finds that the hydro facility is largely safe and performs well and provides estimates for the initial project costs and annual maintenance costs. 
But Gov. Phil Scott made clear last week during a press conference that the state doesn’t have the resources to take over the dam.
The Green River Reservoir’s dam is owned and operated by Morrisville Water & Light, but the utility has been seeking a new owner for the dam, saying they can no longer make a profit operating the facility. The utility argues the state should take it because the state benefits when people visit the Green River Reservoir State Park.
In 2010, Morrisville Water & Light started the process of relicensing the dam with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a step required every few decades. During that process, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources issued new water quality regulations, which establish how the facility can be operated to align with the federal Clean Water Act.
Morrisville Water & Light claimed that operating the facility under the new permit would limit their power generation capabilities, as the water level in the reservoir would need to be roughly stable, impacting the utility’s ability to do drawdowns and resulting in financial loss. After years of litigation, a Vermont Supreme Court decision ultimately determined the regulations were necessary to meet Vermont water quality standards.

Scott Johnstone, general manager of Morrisville Water & Light, said the utility would no longer be able to operate the hydro facility if it’s not producing revenue through power generation, and it has been exploring options to sell the facility, but no other company has been interested in buying it, for the same reason.
The recent legislative report also states that generating power at the facility with the new water quality permit would result in financial loss.
However, Jon Groveman, policy and water program director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, took issue with that finding. “There’s no analysis that I was able to see,” he said. “Maybe that’s accurate, maybe it’s not.” 
“But even if that is correct,” Groveman added, “it doesn’t change what’s needed to meet the minimum water quality standards.” Groveman emphasized the importance of these standards in maintaining healthy waters and fish habitats.
Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, said some hydropower facilities have experienced a reduction in maximum power production, but not to the extent that they wouldn’t be able to generate power without a financial loss. “This is the only instance my staff are aware of where our regulatory framework produced a result that effectively would not allow power generation to continue, at least not cost effectively,” she said.
But Johnstone said there are two reasons the Green River Dam situation may differ from the others. “The Green River Dam was built to fluctuate and draw down water as all reservoir-based dams do, and essentially the state is no longer supportive of that sort of flow regime even where there’s a reservoir,” he said.
Johnstone added that there are a few other dams in the state that rely on drawdowns from reservoirs, but most of them have bigger rivers flowing into them, whereas the Green River Dam relies mostly on the reservoir because it doesn’t have a significant daily flow.
Secondly, the relicensing process may occur at different times for different facilities, and according to Johnstone, the regulations become stricter as the years pass, and some facilities could have different permits.
According to the study, the most cost-effective option would be to maintain the dam and dike to preserve the reservoir but decommission the hydroelectric facility and cease producing power. In that scenario, the report estimates, the reservoir would generate $32.7 million in visitor spending and $1.5 million in state sales tax revenue over the next 20 years. 
Yet Moore highlighted that the facility is particularly complex to operate, so taking ownership of it would be a significant obligation for the state. “We already are responsible for 100 dams; many of which have costly maintenance needs that we are struggling to keep up with,” she said.
Gov. Scott said during last week’s press conference that he was willing to collaborate with the parties involved to find a solution. But what that solution could look like is still unclear.
“We’re not fighting about the permit anymore. We’ve kind of given up on that,” Johnstone said. Morrisville Water & Light is still following the old regulations, but when federal regulators issue a new license, the utility will have to comply with the new water quality permit.
In the meantime, the utility has started the process to receive federal approval to stop producing power at the Green River Dam.
“We’re going to take care of the facility during this, what we hope is a transition period, but our view is that if we are not going to generate power at that facility anymore, then the use of the dam that is left is to support the state park,” Johnstone said. “So our position is that the state of Vermont should now own that dam because it supports that state park.”
The process of transition could take years, so nothing is expected to change at the Green River Reservoir in the immediate future, but now that the legislative report has been released, the ownership of the dam is likely to become a topic of discussion in the next legislative session.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn a January 2024 proposed rule that would have reduced the discharge of nutrients and pollutants from meat packing plants and slaughterhouses. 
The agency said it chose to withdraw the rules in an effort to prioritize the nation’s food supply and to keep food prices down. 
The proposed rules would have revised effluent limitations guidelines and standards, or ELG,s for the meat and poultry products industry. This industry, which the agency refers to as MPP, includes facilities that slaughter, dress and pack meat and poultry products for human or animal consumption. 
According to EPA, the meat and poultry product industry produces wastewater polluted with nitrogen, phosphorus, oil and grease, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and chlorides. 
The EPA’s proposed rule from January 2024 said the more stringent effluent limitations would “improve water quality and protect human health and the environment.” EPA said the regulatory guidelines would cost about $232 million annually in social costs and could reduce pollutant discharges by 100 million pounds per year.

EPA said in its withdrawal statement, published in the Federal Register: 
“In the EPA’s judgment, it is not appropriate to impose additional regulation on the MPP industry, given Administration priorities and policy concerns, including protecting food supply and mitigating inflationary prices for American consumers following a protracted period of high inflation from 2020 through 2024.”
Additionally, the withdrawal decision said EPA’s evaluation of the proposed rules showed it would have caused increased air pollution and solid waste that would “negatively impact the environment and public health.”
The shift also reflects, according to the rationale, the agency’s focus on nitrogen and phosphorus from non-point source polluters, rather than point-source polluters. Non-point source pollution – or pollution that cannot be traced to a singular source – makes up the majority of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution that enters U.S. waterways. 
In line with Trump administration
In its rationale for withdrawing the proposed rule, which was published Sept. 3, 2025, EPA said it only has to revise the ELG guidelines “if appropriate” and has “broad discretion” to consider the priorities and policies of the current administration in its decisions.
“At the core of the EPA’s decision is the understanding that the MPP industry plays a critical role in the nation’s food supply chain, and meat and poultry processors have faced an unprecedented disruption in operations and costs in recent years as a result of several factors, including COVID-19 food supply and supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the unprecedented outbreak of avian flu and New World Screwworm,” the rationale said. 
The rationale said more stringent ELGs on the meat and poultry products industry would lead to “further diversion of the industry’s resources at a critical time.” EPA explained additional limits could cause plants to close or to divert from their a goals of increasing food production and availability. 
The rationale sites several executive orders from President Donald Trump, and recent actions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that show the administration’s priorities for the industry. Closures in the industry, EPA said, could lead to meat shortages and food price increases similar to those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The EPA proposed rules would have regulated water pollution from slaughterhouses and meat packing plants with tools like screening, anaerobic treatments, chemical additions, ultraviolet lights, denitrification, hauling and more. 
In its rationale for withdrawal, EPA said these methods would increase energy demand and therefore lead to increased ozone and fine particulate matter air pollution. 
EPA said the regulatory options would also lead to an estimated 2.5 billion to 8.5 billion-pound increase in solid waste, like animal blood, fluids and excrements, that would have to be sent to landfills or applied to cropland. 
Analysis included in the proposed rules found that the market effect from the additional pollution regulation would be “sufficiently small” and “unlikely to have a noticeable effect on producer or consumer behavior.” It also said the regulatory options would result in a “negligible increase” in required energy generation. 
The proposed rules’ analysis of the regulatory options said it would not “significantly increase” the amount of wastewater treatment sludge generated by the facilities. Estimates in the rules ranged from around 380,000 to 1.2 million pounds of “sludge” annually.
Environmental groups say EPA made the ‘wrong move’ 
In its proposed rules, which were filed under the Biden administration, EPA’s gathered data found that the meat and poultry product industry “discharges the highest phosphorus levels and second highest nitrogen levels of all industrial categories” or point source pollution.
The nutrients, and other pollutants EPA identified as common in the industry, can impact stream health and biodiversity, impact human health and increase drinking water treatment costs. Health risks associated with consuming water high in these pollutants, according to EPA, include infant methemoglobinemia, or blue baby syndrome, colorectal cancer, thyroid disease, neural tube defects and gastrointestinal illness. 
In its environmental impact analysis EPA estimated around 75% of all stream segments below direct and indirect wastewater outfalls from MPP facilities are impaired for at least one pollutant found in MPP wastewater. 
The more stringent guidelines, the proposed rules said, would improve human health outcomes, stream ecology and recreation, drinking water treatment costs and fishing yields, among other things.
The proposed rules were submitted in early 2024 and received thousands of public comments through March 2024, before the current EPA’s decision to withdraw the proposed rules.
Molly Armus, a program manager with the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said EPA’s decision was “a direct contradiction” to the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again directive. 
“For decades, slaughterhouses have dumped toxic waste into our rivers, leaving rural communities to pick up the tab,” Armus said in a statement. “By allowing this pollution to continue unchecked, Trump is once again putting industry profits over clean water and public health.”
Locally, Michael Schmidt, the general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council, said slaughterhouses and packing plants are some of the largest dischargers of nitrate in Iowa. 
Schmidt said even when the industry is regulated, “they don’t always comply with their limits” and referenced a recent settlement from the Iowa Attorney General against a meat packing plant in northeast Iowa that violated its pollution guidelines several times. 
“Rolling back EPA regulations to outdated standards from decades ago is the wrong move,” Schmidt said. “It benefits the near-monopoly international corporations controlling the meat industry, not everyday people. It will not make our water cleaner or Iowans healthier.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA —  Data centers and large manufacturing facilities can pull hundreds of megawatts of electricity from the utility grid. A case in front of Kansas utility regulators has created a new way to ensure costs created by those businesses are fairly distributed among consumers and investors. 
On Oct. 8, the Kansas Corporation Commission will consider a unanimous settlement agreement created after multiple consumer, nonprofit and private interest parties worked to reach agreement on a large load service rate plan and utility tariff. 
A utility tariff sets up a rate structure and terms and conditions of utility services. 
The unanimous agreement designs a rate structure for large-load customers, defined in the agreement as those that reach a peak load of 75 megawatts monthly. 
To put that in perspective, Topeka and Lawrence together probably use about 75 megawatts of electricity per month, said Chuck Caisley, Evergy executive vice president of public affairs. 
Parties involved in the settlement negotiations included KCC staff, Evergy, the Data Center Coalition, the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, school districts, Google LLC, the Sierra Club, multiple industrial businesses and the National Resources Defense Council.
“It’s really going to be, I think, a model for the rest of the United States when it’s all said and done,” Caisley said. “It’s unprecedented when you go into a regulatory proceeding like this on such a complicated issue for all the parties to ultimately walk out and say, ‘This would be fair for everybody.’”
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel at the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, was part of the negotiations on behalf of small businesses and residential consumers. 
“There’s definitely a lot of compromise here,” Astrab said. “This is a unique document. Normally, we file some initial testimony, respond to the application, kind of setting off positions and preferences. But in this docket, we went straight into technical discussions and planning and more of a collaborative approach with utilities, data center customers and other stakeholders in Kansas, to figure out what’s a good tariff.”
 
Equity between customers
The rise of data centers has pushed forward national policy conversations about large-load users, with the intent often to make sure costs aren’t shifted to other customers or that their significant electricity needs don’t destabilize the grid. The conversations can be at odds with the desire to create a welcoming economic development environment.
The U.S. Department of Energy in January issued a policy statement  about mitigation of financial risks should a large user close, leaving an underutilized utility system, and mitigating resource risks if electricity demand would exceed supply, among other issues. 
Kansas’ proposed tariff addresses multiple factors, including costs large utility users will bear if they terminate their contract early and other safety nets, Caisley said. 
Large-load users will sign a 17-year contract outlining their maximum load projections, he said. Even if the company reduces its electrical demands to 50% or 75% of their projections, the company will be required to pay 80% of that projection, Caisley said.
“There’s no other rate in our system today, not even for giant manufacturers, not for oil refineries, not for the Ford plant, not for the Mars plant – they don’t have a requirement like that,” Caisley said. 
A significant amount of collateral is also required to be posted, he said, amounting to two years of minimum bills, which could run to millions of dollars. 
Astrab said discussions about rate design captured the “unique notion” that capital investments would not have been made until a later date if a large-load customer hadn’t been coming onto the grid at a specific point.
 
‘Novel’ element
A third part of the proposed tariff is what Caisley called the “most novel” and an approach that makes the Kansas plan stand out. An interim capacity charge will be in place on top of the regular electrical rate to pay for additional electricity generation that’s required to meet the new demand, he said. It acknowledges that Evergy may need to invest in expansion plans earlier than expected, which comes with a cost.
“As far as I know, that’s one of the first places in the United States that has that, and so these rates will actually be higher than existing industrial consumer rates, but the data centers acknowledge that it’s an issue of equity and fairness,” Caisley said. “From our perspective, if these data centers cause significant rate increases to existing customers, that’s not ultimately good for the state. It’s not ultimately good for economic development.”
 
Open for business
In strategizing about potential rates, making sure Kansas stayed competitive in drawing companies to locate here was important, Astrab and Caisley said. 
“We think that this will protect existing consumers while enabling economic development in Kansas,” Caisley said. “We’ve been calling it the Goldilocks solution. It’s just right.”
Astrab said Kansas policymakers and the governor’s office have made economic development and attracting large business customers a priority. 
“With that context in mind, we don’t want to be in the way of developing Kansas’ economies and communities and bringing new businesses to the area,” he said. “We definitely want to make sure that if we do something, it’s not going to be so strict or cost-prohibitive for business that they’ll say, ‘No, we can’t come to Kansas.’”
Caisley said he believes Kansas is leading the way. 
“Anytime in today’s society and in the environment that any company or town or regulatory entity operates in today, where you can get everybody with such diverse perspectives and interests around a table and stack hands on something, that means you must have done something right,” he said.

Instead, on Sept. 5, HUD issued a new notice of funding to supersede the funding opportunity WDC applied to in May, effectively canceling $75 million in Continuum of Care Build Program grants already announced by Congress. The new funding opportunity, which included significant changes to eligibility criteria, set an application deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 12.
A one-week turnaround is unrealistic given the extensive revisions to eligibility requirements that require applicants to support the partisan agenda of the Trump administration, say WDC and the National Alliance to End Homelessness in a lawsuit against HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The two plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, National Homelessness Law Center, Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and the ACLU of Rhode Island. They claim that HUD’s new eligibility policy is unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
“The new notice categorically disqualifies from consideration any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors,” the lawsuit states. “And, even in jurisdictions with policies the Administration deems acceptable, entities effectively cannot compete for funding unless they profess agreement with the Administration’s view that sex is binary and immutable and foreswear operating safe injection sites or similar programs designed to reduce the harm from drug use—even with wholly non-federal funds.”
The lawsuit lists the following 36 states where housing development projects would be disqualified under the new grant eligibility criteria: Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Georgia; Hawaii; Idaho; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Maine; Massachusetts; Minnesota; Montana; Nebraska; Nevada; v. New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Texas; Utah; Vermont; Washington; West Virginia; and Wisconsin. 
WDC Executive Director Frank Shea said that attaching political strings to competitive funding programs prevents the organization from providing critical services to the community. WDC has no control over whether the state or the city of Providence is or is not considered a sanctuary or allows a safe injection site.
“This is almost like redlining where entire communities aren’t eligible to apply for federal grants that are congressionally authorized programs using our tax money,” Shea said. “None of it is related to whether the housing is good or we’re using the resources appropriately. It’s just random things.”
WDC’s 14-unit project was part of a larger development to preserve 47 family units across 19 historic buildings, including some for families experiencing homelessness. WDC was working with the Rhode Island Continuum of Care and Sojourner House on the project.
Chip Unruh, a spokesperson for Reed’s office, said the senator is working with his colleagues in Congress “to reverse HUD’s unjust decision and ensure HUD’s Inspector General thoroughly investigates.”
“WDC applied for this competitive grant, they earned it, and clearly deserve it,” Unruh said in an email. “But instead of awarding the funds as Congress intended, Trump officials at HUD decided to rewrite this program – for the second time this year – and change it from a grant that does the hard work of reducing homelessness to an extremist program that ignores what actually works. HUD’s job is to reduce homelessness and expand housing opportunities, not make it harder to do those things.”
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon he was still awaiting word on whether a hearing would be scheduled Friday on the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order.
“The new conditions that have been imposed are completely irrelevant to what the grant is about … and designed to simply promote a partisan and ideological agenda of the Trump administration,” Brown said.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.
A HUD spokesperson had not responded to a request for comment as of 6 p.m. Thursday.

In a video message posted on X Wednesday night, Sheriff Ivey, a longtime advocate for the Legislature to pass an open-carry law, said that he had informed his deputies of the policy shift. The statute at issue (790.053) makes it “unlawful for any person to openly carry on or about his or her person any firearm or electric weapon or device.”
“While the opinion at this point is not yet final as the court allows for time for the filing of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, there’s no reason to expect that the court will reverse its decision,” Ivey said.
He’s not the only sheriff making that move.
The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office, and the Pensacola Police Department will no longer enforce the state’s open carry law either, according to the Pensacola News Journal.
The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office announced on Wednesday that it has informed officers that they cannot detain or arrest solely based on openly carrying a firearm.
The ruling isn’t final until the 15-day window for a rehearing has run out, but the state likely won’t appeal the decision. Ron DeSantis advocated as recently as Monday for the Legislature to change the ban on open carry, and Attorney General James Uthmeier’s said on Wednesday that the court’s ruling was “a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
The ruling is only applicable to the First District, which encompasses most of the counties in North Florida. Brevard County is not within that jurisdiction.
Ivey said he had consulted with Wayne Scheiner, the state attorney in Florida’s 18th Judicial Circuit, as well as the attorney representing the Florida Sheriffs Association. He said he had informed all of the police departments in the county that they no longer needed to enforce the ban.
A spokesperson for the police department in Palm Bay, the largest city in Brevard County, confirmed that it is following suit. “At the direction of the State Attorneys’s Office and Florida Police Chiefs Association, we will not be enforcing that statute as it pertains to open carry,” said Lt. Virginia Kilmer.
Not all law enforcement agencies are dropping enforcement — at least not yet.
“We have not changed our policy,” said Cpl. Jamie Miller with the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department.
“We have not issued a change in policy yet on this matter but it is anticipated soon,” said Javonni Hampton with the Leon County Sheriff’s Department.
Several other sheriffs departments did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Florida Sheriffs Association, nor the attorney general’s office.
In its ruling, the First District noted that the Florida Supreme Court had upheld the ban on open carry in its 2017 ruling of Norman v. State. However, Judge Stephanie Ray wrote that the court felt bound instead to apply a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case called New York State Rifle & Association v. Bruen, which struck down New York’s concealed carry restrictions.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, a vocal opponent, drove more than four hours from her home district to learn more about the facility than has been shared with Democratic lawmakers. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — Frustrated by a dearth of information coming her way, a Nebraska lawmaker showed up unannounced this week at the state prison system’s Work Ethic Camp more than four hours from her home district.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.
However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.
“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”
 Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE. 
As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.
After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences. 
“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges. 
Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”
A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early.  (That’s up to the Parole Board.) 
Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.
“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.
Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.
 Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.
A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.
DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.
Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol. 
The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.  
Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.
“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.
While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English. 
Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services. 
 No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”
Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”
Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.
What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission. 
Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.
A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.
“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”
 Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said. 
But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.
After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.
“I’ll be coming back,” she said.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, testifies Thursday against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver warned Missouri lawmakers Thursday that the effort to redraw the 5th District seat to favor Republicans will be long remembered by voters who resent being swapped by politicians seeking to increase their power.
Speaking to the Senate Local Government, Elections and Pensions Committee, Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that Texas has already revised district lines this year to favor Republicans and California will vote later this year on a plan that favors Democrats.
President Donald Trump is demanding the changes to help Republicans keep their slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Democrats are fighting back in the states they control.
“If we fight fire with fire long enough,” Cleaver said, “all we’ll have left is ashes.”
Cleaver’s warning went unheeded and the committee, on a 6-2 party-line vote a few hours later, sent the redistricting plan, which has already passed the Missouri House, to the Senate for debate. By the same vote, the committee also approved a proposal altering how majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
Both pieces of legislation will be debated Friday, with Republicans apparently ready to shut down debate as they did to push through rules changes on Wednesday.
During the hearing, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said he expects little or no debate on Friday.
“They’re going to shut us down,” Beck said. “They’re not going to let us speak on this, because it’s inconvenient.”
There was some grumbling about the process from one Republican, state Sen. Joe Nicola of Grain Valley, who said he has been told he can speak on the floor about the legislation but that no amendments will be accepted.
“When I don’t have my voice, the 185,000 people I represent also lose their voice, and that’s extremely irritating to me,” Nicola said. “I’ve seen many processes here, and even recently, the rules being broken. And it’s just a shame. It’s a real shame for this institution.”
Nicola voted for both pieces of legislation in the committee.
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. The other Democrat, U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell, represents the 1st District in St. Louis.
Cleaver said he skipped votes in Washington to make the rare appearance for a member of Congress before a state legislative committee. 
“I chose to miss (Wednesday) votes, and I chose to miss the ones today, because I thought this was extremely important,” Cleaver said.
The 5th District, which he has represented since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts while heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, speaks to reporters Thursday after testifying against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Cleaver said he is saddened by the bill and the need to explain how he works to represent all points of view and work with Missouri Republicans in Congress on the state’s behalf.
Polling, Cleaver said, shows voters oppose the redistricting plan. 
“This is immensely unpopular, so I was not just here representing myself,” Cleaver said. “I’m representing the people of this district.”
And, he said, he intends to seek re-election.
“A lot goes into making another decision,” Cleaver said. “But right now, I’m running.”
No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. While state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel who sponsored the bill, was testifying, he was challenged by state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, on the origin of the new map.
Deaton said it was drawn in Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office before the special session was called. 
Nurrenbern said she did not believe it.
“I think it is a lot of BS what you guys keep doing, that you’re saying that this map was drawn in the state of Missouri,” Nurrenbern said. “We all know the truth, representative. We all know that this came straight from D.C.”
Deaton said he accepted Kehoe’s word that the bill was drafted in his office. 
“People in Washington, D.C., as I’ve observed them, are not shy,” Deaton said. “If they had a map, I assume they would have been willing to put it out there and say, ‘we think this is a wonderful map. We hope Missouri would adopt it.’”
Final passage on Friday won’t automatically put the maps into place for next year’s election. The bill will take effect 90 days after the special session ends, but plans are being made by labor unions and others to seek a referendum, which would delay implementation until a statewide vote.
And opponents promised the bill will be challenged in court. The Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to draw new congressional district lines after every decennial census. The current map was passed in 2022 and the next census is in 2030.
Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition said she believes the constitution does not allow a new map to be imposed now.
“This map is also subject to a challenge under the Voting Rights Act for the dilution of African-American votes,” Lieberman said. 
Cleaver is Black and the line chosen for part of the district boundary, Troost Avenue, was the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal, Lieberman said.
“This is an unprecedented power grab here in Missouri,” she said.
 Initiative petition changes

The hearing on the changes to the initiative process brought some testy exchanges between Democrats and Republicans.
Currently, any proposal placed on a statewide ballot needs only a majority of votes to pass. That is the standard for constitutional amendments, statutory changes and proposals subject to a referendum.
The proposed changes, which would be on a ballot and subject to the current standard for passage, would only apply to constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petitions. Along with a statewide majority, those constitutional amendments would also need a majority vote in their favor in all eight congressional districts.
If one district opposed a ballot measure while the other seven passed it, as few as 5.3% of voters could control the outcome for the whole state.
“The main purpose is to protect the Constitution from changes that the majority of all the voters in Missouri, in every area of the state, don’t agree with,” said state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly, as he presented the bill to the Senate committee.
As the committee was voting, Beck tried to make it subject to the same majority requirements it would impose on citizen initiative petitions.
“If this is such a great idea and we are going to change the constitution, and this is the best way to do it, why don’t we use that same standard for the legislature changing it as the initiative process,” Beck said.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, said Beck was being “too clever” and joined other Republicans in voting down the proposal.
“The whole point of this is to set those standards and to change those standards,” Brattin said, “but it has to be adopted by the current standard.”

Kevin Stitt on Thursday appointed three officials to his administration, all of whom he has previously named to other positions in Oklahoma state government. 
Stitt appointed Donelle Harder as Oklahoma Secretary of State, David Ostrowe as chief operating officer and Dustin Hilliary as his senior advisor. 
“We successfully launched this administration by bringing a fresh set of eyes from Oklahoma’s business community, and we will finish the same way,” Stitt said in a statement. “These three outstanding Oklahomans bring diverse strengths: Dustin’s trusted leadership and negotiation prowess, David’s operational acumen, and Donelle’s strategic vision.”
The appointments follow the resignations of Josh Cockroft, who serves as secretary of state and Stitt’s chief policy advisor, and Rick Rose, the head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and Oklahoma’s chief operating officer. Cockcroft’s resignation is effective Oct. 2 while Rose plans to depart Sept. 26.

Harder previously served as Stitt’s senior advisor and deputy Secretary of State and worked as his spokesperson and campaign manager. She also previously worked as former U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s spokesperson. 
In the private sector, she sold her regional public relations and marketing firm to Pinkston in 2022, and she became one of the company’s senior vice presidents. 
“I’m honored to serve as Secretary of State and support Governor Stitt’s administration again,” Harder said in a statement. “I look forward to sharpening our strategic approach and ensuring this administration remains effective and focused on delivering good government for the people of Oklahoma.”
Her appointment is effective Oct. 1. 
Ostrowe will return to Stitt’s administration as the chief operating officer and secretary to “drive cabinet coordination and support agency directors.”

He currently serves as president and CEO of O&M Restaurant Group leading brand expansions across states. 
During Stitt’s first term, Ostrowe served as Oklahoma’s first Secretary of Digital Transformation and Administration. He was indicted by former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter in late 2020 for allegedly bribing a state official. Ostrowe was accused of threatening to cut funding from the state Tax Commission if commissioners didn’t waive penalties and interests on a tax debt. 
Current Attorney General Gentner Drummond dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled, and apologized to Ostrowe on behalf of the state after he took office. He said Ostrowe should not have been indicted and did nothing wrong.
“In Governor Stitt’s first administration, we worked with passion to deliver digital transformation and make government more efficient and transparent,” Ostrowe said in a statement. “I am honored to return as COO to help finish that mission and continue advancing good government for all Oklahomans.”

Hilliary, Stitt’s new senior advisor and chief negotiator, also serves as the vice chair of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. It was not immediately clear if he would continue serving in both roles. 
He is co-CEO of Hilliary Communications, which provides telephone and broadband service to customers in Oklahoma, Texas and Iowa. Hilliary is also co-publisher of the Hilliary Media Group, a media holding company, and operates a real estate development company.
“It is an honor to serve Oklahoma and to work alongside Governor Stitt in his final term to advance policies with the Legislature that put our state on a strong path today and for future generations,” Hilliary said in a statement.
The salaries of all three appointees were not immediately provided by the Governor’s Office.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)One day after announcing a deal with Japan’s largest electrical producer, the lead developer of the proposed trans-Alaska gas pipeline has revealed a second agreement, this time with POSCO International Corp. a South Korean steel manufacturer.
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the firm advancing the pipeline project, declined to make the terms of the agreement available on Thursday.
Glenfarne released a statement saying that the agreement includes terms for POSCO to buy 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from the pipeline, if built. 
“This agreement will include initial terms for POSCO to supply a significant portion of the steel required for Alaska LNG’s 807-mile, 42-inch pressurized natural gas pipeline,” the statement said.
Glenfarne owns 75% of AKLNG, as the proposed pipeline project is also known, which would transport liquified natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to the Kenai Peninsula for sale and export. The remaining 25% of the project is held by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. The two companies are pursuing the pipeline via a co-owned subsidiary, 8 Star Alaska.
Rex Cannon, co-president of 8 Star Alaska, said last month that the firm intends to make a final investment decision on the first phase of the project before the end of the year.
That first phase would consist of a pipeline for in-state gas customers. The second phase of the project includes a gas treatment facility and an export terminal on the Kenai Peninsula. A final investment decision on that aspect is expected in 2026.
Based on public announcements, 8 Star Alaska has not signed enough gas purchase agreements from North Slope producers to meet expected demand.
Previous proposed gas pipeline projects have failed in large part due to funding issues. Cannon said in August that 8 Star Alaska is pursuing federal loans from the Trump administration, and loans from outside investors in order to fund construction.
Gas purchase agreements like the ones announced this week are believed to be a key first step in showing the project is economical and worth investment.
The AKLNG pipeline is expected to have a final capacity of 20 million tons of natural gas per year. As of  Thursday, Glenfarne has announced preliminary commitments from buyers for approximately 12 million tons per year. 
Earlier this year, POSCO Holdings Inc., the parent company of POSCO International, said it was seeking to expand its liquefied natural gas businesses, partially in an effort to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s drive to boost U.S. exports.
Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly said that he sees the development of Alaska as a top priority.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)On Feb. 13, 2019, Tennessee lawmakers officially recognized the Orange Heart Medal, becoming the first state in the country to do so. Since that time, a number of other states have followed the Volunteer State’s lead. 
The Beehive State is currently not among the states that have formally recognized the Orange Heart Medal. Is there really any need for Utah legislators to approve an Orange Heart Medal to honor victims of Agent Orange exposure?
One could argue that Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides don’t really need any more recognition for their sacrifice.  After all, those veterans have already received an official federal service medal, the Vietnam Service Medal.
Additionally, Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides during the war are eligible for compensation from the Veterans Administration for illnesses associated with exposure to those chemicals. 
While the Vietnam Service Medal is a prestigious medal, it is awarded for a specific period of service performed in a specific area. A number of different awards are also authorized for circumstances that took place during the same period covered by the Vietnam Service Medal.
One notable example is the Purple Heart. That medal is awarded to service members wounded in action during wartime. It is not that uncommon for a veteran to receive a service medal and a Purple Heart during the same war.
In the case of VA compensation, many veterans do receive benefits for presumptive conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. However, the VA currently only recognizes a certain number of presumptive health issues linked to toxic herbicide exposure. That number could well increase.
Regardless of VA compensation for Agent Orange related illnesses received by eligible veterans, Purple Heart recipients also receive VA benefits in certain cases. One example is a veteran who became disabled due to a wound received in combat.  
A key difference between veterans who receive a Purple Heart and an Orange Heart Medal is the nature of the injury sustained. Purple Heart recipients were wounded externally, while Orange Heart Medal recipients were wounded internally. 
Like veterans who have received a Purple Heart for their obvious wounds, veterans exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides during the Vietnam War deserve an Orange Heart Medal for their inconspicuous wounds.
This rationale compelled Vietnam veteran Ken Gamble, founder and president of the Orange Heart Medal Foundation in Springfield, Tennessee, to design and create the Orange Heart Medal. 
Ken hopes the medal will eventually be approved in every state in the country. And there are certainly veterans in Utah who feel the same way. That was made clear by a recent Orange Heart Medal pinning ceremony in Sunset’s Rachael Runyan Memorial Park.
On Aug. 9, Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation Chairman Larry Kerr presented an Orange Heart Medal to Sunset veteran Robert F. Smalling in a solemn and emotional pinning ceremony. It was a ceremony that will no doubt take place with much greater frequency throughout the Beehive State.
The Orange Heart Medal is a very meaningful way to recognize veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange. So it is not really a question of whether lawmakers should approve an Orange Heart Medal. The real question is when will lawmakers approve a Utah Orange Heart Medal?",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Robert_F_Smalling_Orange_Heart_Medal-1024x967.jpg,,,2025-09-11 17:57:04.340222

Spencer Cox talks to media after conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hours after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, a morose Utah Gov. Spencer Cox took the podium at a news conference alongside state and federal law enforcement officials. 
Cox — a Republican who has devoted a large part of his political career trying to encourage bipartisanship in an increasingly politically polarized world — did more than condemn Kirk’s killing, calling it a “political assassination.” 
“This is a dark day for our state,” the governor said. “It’s a tragic day for our nation.”
Though Cox has tried to combat polarization in favor of civil discourse through his Disagree Better campaign, his home state made worldwide headlines for the very thing he’s tried to discourage. Politico’s headline put it this way: “Utah is now the epicenter of the political divide its governor warned about.” 
While speaking about Kirk’s killing on Wednesday, Cox made another plea. He urged Utahns and Americans to look at the bigger picture of increased political violence happening across the country — and also look inward. 
“Our nation is broken,” he said. 

“Our nation is broken.”

Cox pointed to the assassination of Minnesota House Democratic leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, the firebombing of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home that prosecutors say was attempted murder, and attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. 
“Nothing I say can unite us as a country. Nothing I can say right now can fix what is broken,” he said. “Nothing I can say can bring back Charlie Kirk. Our hearts are broken.” 
As Cox gave his solemn speech, state public safety and FBI officials were hunting for the suspected shooter, who as of Thursday had still not been found. 
“Charlie Kirk was, first and foremost, a husband and a dad to two young children,” Cox said. “We mourn with his wife, his children, his families, his friends. We mourn as a nation.” 
Manhunt for Charlie Kirk shooter: Rifle found, person of interest photos released

Kirk was also founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions, and a close ally of President Donald Trump. He was a widely known and often polarizing internet personality. 
That political involvement brought Kirk to Utah Valley University, one of the many college campuses across the U.S. where Kirk engaged students and members of the public in political debate with his signature “prove me wrong” events. But UVU was his last. 
An estimated 3,000 people attended Wednesday’s event. After the single gunshot rang out and Kirk collapsed from a bullet to his neck, students scattered, screaming in horror.  It was a moment that hundreds of students witnessed firsthand and now millions more around the world are viewing in viral, graphic videos that continue to spread on social media.
Cox lamented that university campuses are supposed to be places for students to learn and grow, not places where students fear for their safety.

“Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate, to shape ideas and to persuade people,” the governor said. “Historically, our university campuses in this nation and here in the state of Utah, have been the place where truth and ideas are formulated and debated. And that’s what he does. He comes on college campuses and he debates.” 
Free speech and debate are “foundational to the formation of our country, to our most basic constitutional rights,” Cox said. “And when someone takes the life of a person because of their ideas or their ideals, then that very constitutional foundation is threatened.”
As of Thursday, law enforcement officials had not released any information about the shooter’s motive and the investigation is ongoing. 
“I want to make it crystal clear right now, to whoever did this, we will find you. We will try you. And we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law,” Cox said. “And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.”
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

Cox also condemned anyone who may have reacted to Kirk’s killing with any level of celebration. 
“If anyone, in the sound of my voice, celebrated even a little bit at the news of the shooting, I would beg you to look in the mirror,” Cox said, “and see if you can find a better angel in there somewhere.” 
The governor said he didn’t care what Kirk’s politics were — “I care that he was an American.” 
“We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be. To ask ourselves, is this it? Is this what 250 years has brought on us? I pray that that’s not the case,” he said, pointing to the upcoming anniversary of the nation’s founding. 
Cox said he also prayed that “those who hated what Charlie Kirk stood for will put down their social media and their pens and pray for his family.” 
“And that all of us — all of us — will try to find a way to stop hating our fellow Americans,” Cox said.

Four public hearings this fall will review the reassessment process, property tax impacts, and education funding, as Republicans question the effort’s bipartisanship.
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE
DOVER — September 3, 2025 — Delaware lawmakers have created special House and Senate committees to review the state’s first comprehensive property reassessment in more than four decades, aiming to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.
House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown (D) and Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D) announced the committee assignments on Wednesday, emphasizing transparency and public engagement. The committees are scheduled to hold four public hearings between September and November, which will be livestreamed from Legislative Hall.
Purpose of the Committees
Legislative leaders said the committees are intended to identify lessons from the reassessment, recommend process improvements, and explore targeted tax relief options for Delawareans who may be facing significant property tax changes.
“We know that there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the reassessment process – both for Delawareans and for lawmakers,” said Speaker Minor-Brown. “These committees are about finding those answers and putting together a thoughtful roadmap that we can act on in the coming legislative session.”
Senate Majority Leader Bryan Townsend (D) said committee members were chosen for geographic balance and policy experience in housing and land use. “I look forward to putting our heads down and working together over the coming months to really drill down on what happened, and make recommendations about how we can move forward on behalf of the people of Delaware,” Townsend said.

Public Hearings: Topics and Timeline
The committees will hold four public hearings this fall, each addressing a different set of issues:

Week of September 22 – Review of the 2024 reassessment process

County-level practices, Tyler Technologies’ methodology, intergovernmental coordination, error safeguards, appeals process, and an update on emergency legislation passed August 12.


Week of October 6 – Future reassessments and tax structures

Comparative models from other states, potential differentiated tax rates by property type or size, and county-level capacity to implement such systems.


Week of October 20 – Delaware property tax framework and exemptions

Programs for taxpayers on fixed incomes or facing hardship, comparison to other states, and potential updates to property tax exemptions.


Week of November 3 – Property reassessment and education funding

The reassessment’s relationship to Delaware’s education funding system and the legal settlement that prompted the 2024 reassessment, as well as coordination with the Public Education Funding Commission.



Republican Caucus Raises Concerns Over Process
Following the announcement, the House Republican Caucus issued a statement criticizing how Democratic leaders initiated the reassessment review effort, arguing that Republican proposals were sidelined and that the committees were formed without bipartisan consultation.
“Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers: 27 of 41 seats in the House and 15 of 21 in the Senate. And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion,” the statement said.
Republicans said they were not given input or advance notice about the new committees and argued that earlier Republican-sponsored bills — including measures to double the senior property tax credit (HB 73) and limit tax hikes tied to reassessment (HB 245 and HB 246) — were ignored during the recent special session.
The statement also questioned the committee’s bipartisan nature:
“It’s clear Republican participation will serve only as window dressing, a superficial gesture intended solely to lend a veneer of bipartisanship to a process that is anything but.”
Looking Ahead
All committee meetings will be open to the public and livestreamed at legis.delaware.gov. Legislative leaders said additional details on the hearings and opportunities for public engagement will be announced in the coming days.
While Democrats frame the committees as a step toward transparency and solutions, and Republicans voice skepticism about the process, the hearings will give Delawareans a rare, statewide look at the property reassessment system and its potential long-term effects on taxes and school funding.

“We’re supporting a major expansion in food production, investing in renewable energy, and fueling local economic development,” Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a press release. “Each project strengthens our communities and ensures long-term growth for our state.”  
The Board of Economic Development approved the awards Wednesday. 
Bel Brands, known for producing mini-cheese wheels dipped in red wax, received approval for a state loan of up to $10 million. The loan, offered through the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative (REDI) Fund, provides low-interest, long-term financing for companies that want to expand or relocate in South Dakota. The company plans to build an additional 100,000 square feet of space at its Brookings plant, which would double its production capacity.
Grant Solar LLC received approval for up to $2.8 million in tax relief through the Reinvestment Payment Program to help build a 585-acre solar power facility in McCook County. The program refunds a portion of the state sales and use taxes paid on construction costs, with the goal of making capital projects more affordable to build in the state. Bel Brands was previously awarded up to $2.6 million in tax relief from the same program for its expansion.
Ally Dakota Development, a group with offices in Watertown and Rapid City that provides development support to local businesses, was awarded a $7,500 grant through the state’s Economic Development Partnership Program. The program provides small grants to help local organizations hire staff, run programs, or carry out projects that support business growth.

The six-page opinion overturned a circuit court judge’s decision last week that the state must hold onto its data on 3.3 million registered voters — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — while a lawsuit plays out over privacy concerns.
The U.S. Department of Justice asked for that information last month as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.

Opinopm 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision, the state Election Commission could hand over its voter information right away, said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing a voter suing to stop the release of her personal information.
Whether the commission will do so is unclear. An agency spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.
The agency began working to comply with the Trump administration’s request Aug. 27, three weeks after it sent the first of two letters asking for the information, spokesman John Michael Catalano said previously. The Department of Justice set a due date of Sept. 5, two days after the circuit court judge’s order barred the state from complying.
The Supreme Court’s order, which all five justices signed, didn’t get into the questions of privacy raised in the lawsuit. Instead, justices focused on procedural issues in the order barring the state from fulfilling the request.
Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein didn’t explain in her order what sort of damage Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the lawsuit, might face if the state gives her information to the federal government, according to the Supreme Court’s order. Goodstein also failed to explain whether she believed the lawsuit was likely to succeed, which is required for a court to intervene, the order reads.
Goodstein told the Election Commission not to comply with the request before the agency had even received notice of the lawsuit, which was filed Aug. 29 ahead of the Labor Day weekend. That on its own violates longstanding court precedent, the state’s highest court said.
She scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning in Aiken County but canceled it after the state Election Commission appealed to the Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will continue. Justices made it clear Crook can still ask for a hearing in her case. Where and when that might happen is still to be determined.
“We still are going to get our day in court,” said Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
Governor joins the lawsuit
Although the initial lawsuit didn’t name Gov. Henry McMaster as a defendant, he asked to join in defense of the state Election Commission.
The request “should not be a big deal,” McMaster’s attorney wrote last Thursday in response to the lawsuit.
Anyone can purchase partial voter records, including full names, addresses and birthdays. Also, federal agencies — including the IRS and Social Security Administration — already have most of the information requested, McMaster’s filing argued.
“The federal government already has Crook’s full Social Security number (as well as every other South Carolinian’s) because the federal government issues those Social Security numbers,” the governor’s attorney wrote. “It’s untenable (to put it mildly) to insist that the State cannot tell the federal government something that the federal government already knows.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment on the high court’s decision.
Judge temporarily blocks release of SC voter data to Trump administration

While it’s true that some government agencies have access to personal information, the Department of Justice clearly isn’t among them, Hutto said. If it were, the agency wouldn’t be asking for states to provide that information, he said.
McMaster told reporters last week that he would like to enter a formal agreement with the Department of Justice making it clear that the agency will respect voters’ privacy rights.
However, those privacy rights don’t extend to voter registration information, his attorneys argued in a court filing. South Carolinians have a right to privacy only from electronic surveillance and in cases of bodily autonomy, McMaster’s filing reads.
Federal law gives government agencies the authority to get whatever data they need to fulfill their obligations, McMaster’s attorneys argued. That includes the Department of Justice, which is tasked with enforcing voter laws, his office wrote.
“Nothing is unreasonable about giving the federal government information it already has (Social Security numbers) or information that Congress has authorized it to obtain (driver’s license numbers),” the filing reads.
Those laws apply only if the agency has a good reason to get the information, which the Department of Justice hasn’t proven, Hutto argued.
If the Department of Justice said exactly what it planned to do with people’s personal information, voters like Crook might not be so concerned about violations to their privacy, Hutto said.
“Why do they need to know?” Hutto said. “That is the very data everyone says we need to safeguard from identity theft.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Headquarters-Voting-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

New Mexico State Police posted on social media a little after 12 p.m. on Thursday that a bomb threat had been called in somewhere in the area of Camino De Cruz Blanca in Santa Fe between Camino Del Monte Sol and Calle Romolo. 
Students from Santa Fe Preparatory School were evacuated, according to media reports. 
Police then alerted the public about an hour later that both streets were open. 
According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, a separate bomb threat prompted a precautionary and brief closure of Santa Fe City Hall. A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to Source’s text message or phone call. Neither did a State Police spokesperson.
In the aftermath of Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, threats Thursday at colleges in Virginia and Historically Black Colleges and University campuses across the country have led to lockdowns and canceled classes.

 Chris Nordstrum, the communications director for Senate Democrats, initially confirmed the threat to Source New Mexico. Wirth subsequently issued a statement mid-afternoon acknowledging that a threat had been made against him, “leading to disruption and an evacuation at schools in my neighborhood. I am grateful to our state and local law enforcement agencies for their swift and professional response to this serious matter, and to the school officials who skillfully managed the disturbance.”
“Political violence and threats against elected officials have no place in our democratic society and are never an acceptable way to address political differences. Regardless of our political views, we must reject intimidation and work together through peaceful, lawful means to resolve our disagreements.”

Wirth concluded the statement by saying he remains “committed to fostering respectful civic dialogue and protecting the safety of all who serve our community.”
New Mexico State Police initially posted on social media a little after 12 p.m. on Thursday that a bomb threat had been called in somewhere in the area of Camino De Cruz Blanca in Santa Fe between Camino Del Monte Sol and Calle Romolo. 
A statement from City of Santa Fe Deputy Police Chief Ben Valdez provided to Source said that city and state police initially responded to a bomb threat in the 1000 block of Camino de Cruz Blanca at approximately 10:40 am.  SFPD provided patrol officers for scene security and traffic control, and its Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit to investigate the threat.
“Contact was made with leadership at Santa Fe Prep to inform them of an incident near their campus. Santa Fe Prep was evacuated, parents were contacted to pick up their students.  Both NMSP and SFPD were present with the students and faculty as a controlled release was conducted and students were released to their parents,” Valdez’s statement said.

At the same time, Santa Fe Police received “another threat of the same nature” on a nearby street.

“Out of an abundance of caution, considering yesterday’s senseless killing of political activist Charlie Kirk, City Hall was placed on a lockdown,” Valdez wrote. That lockdown was lifted at 1:47 p.m.

“We take all threats seriously,” Valdez’s statement said. “They have no place in our community and individuals that make threats will be held accountable.”

Thomas/Getty Images).A Jackson County judge is weighing whether to keep in place two state regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing its providers from performing medication abortions in Missouri.
Over the course of several hours Wednesday, attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office argued before Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang over whether current regulations on abortion medication — the most common kind of abortion — are a necessary safeguard or onerous and unconstitutional.
In November, Missouri voters legalized abortion up to fetal viability. But abortion remains widely inaccessible to most Missourians as a number of related legal cases play out in the courts. 
Procedural abortions are again accessible on a limited schedule at Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. But medication abortions are not available because Planned Parenthood does not have an approved medication abortion complication plan or supplemental insurance required by state regulations.
Missouri abortion rights amendment trumps most restrictions, judge rules

Planned Parenthood continues to argue that these restrictions fly in the face of the abortion rights amendment, which reads: “The government shall not discriminate against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.”
Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general involved in the lawsuit, argued Wednesday that “regulation and medicine go together.”
Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, countered that the complication plan puts the state “squarely between patients and providers” by forcing “medically unnecessary requirements.” 
In late March, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services rejected Planned Parenthood’s complication plan, stating that it did not meet the requirements of a new emergency rule published the same day by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office. 
That rule requires the complication plan for any facility prescribing abortion medication to more than 10 women a month must: 

Have an on-call OB-GYN who lives within 25 miles of the clinic available at all times for seven days after a patient takes the medication. This physician would be required to treat any complications that arise as a result of the medication unless the standard of care requires someone else to treat them. 
Provide for patients who live further than 25 miles from the clinic the name of the emergency room and a physician “within a reasonable distance of the location where the patient will complete the abortion.”
Submit the full names of all physicians involved in the local complication plans.

A medication abortion requires two different kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. 
Both medications can also be used to treat miscarriages.
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. Hemorrhaging and infection are among rare complications. 
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Wednesday’s hearing included testimony from two OB-GYNS: Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, and Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion research group.
Baum said a complication plan is not required when she performs vasectomies at the clinic, even though she said the risk of infection is greater for that procedure.
Between April 2018 and August 2023, there were 438 abortion complication reports — including 186 from medication abortions — filed with Missouri’s health department. Details on individual cases were not presented. 
In her testimony, Skop suggested the number of complications could be higher. It is difficult to collect accurate data, she claimed, because many women are advised by abortion providers not to tell primary care or emergency room doctors that they had an abortion if seeking further treatment. 
Baum said that’s because miscarriage and medication abortion present the same and require the same treatment, so choosing not to disclose an abortion can protect a patient’s privacy. She added that when she administers mifepristone to patients at her clinics in Illinois before sending them home with a dose of misoprostol, she gives them multiple ways to reach a provider if they have concerns that they are bleeding too much or are experiencing any other complications.
Missouri law also requires providers prescribing abortion medication to carry tail insurance, a supplemental plan to medical malpractice insurance that would extend coverage for 21 years following the administration of the medication in case there is a claim of “personal injury to or death of a child who survives such abortion.”
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have argued in briefings that this 2019 law is also discriminatory because it’s not required for other medical events such as childbirth, which carries much higher risks of injury or death. 
Among the state’s witnesses was Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Abortion Survivors Network, based in Kansas City, which connects women who underwent failed abortions and their families with resources. Ohden is also an outspoken opponent of any abortion exceptions. 
“The reality is that abortions fail far more frequently than women are told about,” she testified Wednesday, based on anecdotal data she said she’s gathered over years of working with thousands of people through her organization.
If a medication abortion fails, patients can take another dose of medication or undergo an in-clinic abortion, according to Planned Parenthood’s website.
While Pai-Thompson, Planned Parenthood’s attorney, said the restriction is another attempt to subject abortion providers to licensing penalties, Donohue argued it was in place to protect doctors. 
A “rural woman” might not know a “big, fancy” medical word like mifepristone, Donohue said. He then gave a hypothetical of a woman accidentally “overdosing” on mifepristone because her local doctor didn’t have access to medical records indicating she was already prescribed mifepristone by Planned Parenthood. 
FDA data shows among the nearly 6 million cases of patients taking mifepristone, only one documented death has occurred due to taking too much of the medication.
Donohue said any inability of Planned Parenthood to meet these requirements is “self–imposed.”
Pai-Thompson countered that any restrictions are a big deal if they’re unconstitutional.
Missouri judge weighing whether new abortion ban should appear on 2026 ballot

Missouri has a long history of imposing “targeted regulation of abortion providers” laws.
These regulations played a large role in reducing the number of abortions in Missouri from more than 5,000 a decade ago to 167 in 2020, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
As the medication abortion regulations hearing played out in downtown Kansas City on Wednesday, the Missouri Court of Appeals was hearing arguments down the street in the Missouri attorney general’s attempt to overturn a preliminary injunction issued by Zhang allowing clinics across the state to resume procedural abortions for the first time in years.
The attorney general’s office is asking the appeals court to reverse that decision and again make procedural abortions inaccessible in Missouri.
The appeal was initially filed by Bailey, who recently resigned to become co-deputy director of the FBI. Catherine Hanaway, a former lawmaker and U.S. attorney, has taken his place.  
Gillian Wilcox, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, said it’s yet to be seen if the change in leadership will change the office’s approach to the several abortion-related cases it’s involved in.
“At this point we expect the state to do everything in their power to have all of the restrictions on abortion care stay in place,” Wilcox said, “despite the amendment that the voters passed.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/planned-parenthood-2-e1707947543157.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)BECKLEY, W.Va. — A former West Virginia health officer testified Thursday that the state’s compulsory vaccination law, as it’s written without religious or philosophical exemptions, is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. 
“At the end of the day, the… compulsory vaccine law actually is about creating healthy communities,” Dr. Cathy Slemp said. “It’s about protecting the health and safety of children, having a well vaccinated population so that we decrease disease spread and the occurrence of outbreaks.”
Slemp was West Virginia’s state health officer from 2002 to 2011 and again from 2018 through 2020. She testified Thursday during a hearing in Raleigh County Circuit Court. 
Circuit Judge Michael Froble is overseeing two consolidated lawsuits in a battle over the state’s school vaccination law and religious freedom. 
In one case, Miranda Guzman and other families are suing the West Virginia Board of Education and the Raleigh County Board of Education so that their children may attend school with a religious exemption for vaccines. The state school board has directed county boards not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July issued a preliminary ruling allowing students in the case to attend class, but the ruling is limited to those students. The hearing Thursday was on a permanent injunction in the case. 
The other case is a lawsuit filed by Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson, parents of immunocompromised children, who are suing the state Department of Health to stop it from issuing religious exemptions. The plaintiffs in that case are represented by the American Civil LIberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
All states require students attending school to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow students to opt out of the vaccination requirements because of philosophical or religious objections to the shots. 
In January, Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established the exemptions in state code. 
As health officer, one part of Slemp’s job was to review appeals of decisions of the state immunization officer about medical vaccines exemptions.
Slemp said the state has gotten on average 50 applications for medical exemptions per year over the last seven years, about 80% of which are approved. 
By contrast, the state health department has gotten 570 applications for religious or philosophical exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year, Froble said. 
She said even small percentages of religious and philosophical exemptions increase disease. 
“They look like small numbers, but they are significant,” Slemp said. 
Slemp said states that allow religious exemptions see a “multifold” increase of vaccination exemptions overall, which can contribute to disease outbreaks. 
“So that does increase at a population level, the number of people that are unvaccinated, and that then therefore leads to increased risk of disease and outbreaks,” Slemp said. 
Non-medical exemptions also tend to be in clusters, compared to medical exemptions which are evenly distributed, Slemp said. Different diseases require different levels of vaccination for “herd immunity.” So some counties may have higher risk than others. 
Froble said Thursday that the state Department of Health has not said which of the 570 exemptions that have been sought are for religious versus philosophical reasons. 
The distinction is important, he said. 
Morrisey’s executive order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which says that “no state action may burden a person’s exercise of freedom of religion, unless doing so is essential and is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.”
“If we are to really determine the application of the Equal Protection [for Religion Act], I believe the board is restricted only to consider religious exceptions, not philosophical exemptions,” he said. “They wouldn’t apply under the Equal Protection [for Religion Act.]”
Froble said part of the compelling state interest in the case is that if religious exemptions to the state school vaccination law are allowed, it may “open the floodgate” for people who don’t have religious beliefs but don’t like vaccines to get exemptions. 
“I believe the court is very concerned with trying to protect the religious beliefs of individuals, but also believes that is a very compelling interest by the state to make sure that we protect children in our school… I think that’s a paramount issue that we need to address in this case,” Froble said. 
Chris Weist, an attorney for families suing the state Board of Education, said he doesn’t know if the agency has a breakdown of philosophical and religious exemptions. 
“I want to be clear, we’ve never made a claim in this case that our particular plaintiffs are entitled to enforce the exemptions that they’ve gotten from the health department necessarily,” he said. “What we said is, ‘we’ve got an EPRA claim. Our clients have sincerely held religious beliefs. That triggers EPRA.’”
Weist said one of the reasons they haven’t asked for a statewide ruling is because determining whether the 570 exemptions are religious or philosophical reasons would be challenging. 
“I’ll be candid with the court, our team has discussed class wide relief, and that issue of, is it religious, or is it something else is a challenge to that,” Weist said. 
Holly Wilson, an attorney for the state Department of Health argued that there is no distinction between a religious and a philosophical exemption. 
“The West Virginia Supreme Court has already construed the term religious or religion for purposes of the First Amendment free exercise clause that religion encompasses philosophical objections,” she said. “These are one and the same… you can’t break these two things apart because they are the same.”
The judge gave counsel in the lawsuits two weeks to write briefs about religious versus philosophical exemptions. 
The hearing in the case is expected to continue.

Ned Lamont on Wednesday announced the creation of a new state office focused on eliminating barriers to behavioral health care in Connecticut and nominated Howard Sovronsky, a former social worker with leadership experience in both government and health care, as its inaugural head.
The Connecticut Office of the Behavioral Health Advocate will help residents access behavioral health services and help providers receive payments from insurers for the care they provide.
“Access to mental health services is one of the most pressing needs of our time, and it needs to be treated just as we do for any other physical health situation,” Lamont stated in a press release. “This new office will provide the residents of our state with an advocate to help break down the barriers that still stand in the way of true mental health equity.”
Most recently, Sovronsky served as chief behavioral health officer at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford, and he has more than 40 years of experience as a licensed clinical social worker. He also worked in Nassau County, Long Island’s local government for two decades, including a stint as the commissioner of the county’s Department of Mental Health and Development Disabilities. 
In his new role as the behavioral health advocate, Sovronsky wants to hear from people who receive behavioral health services about what improvements the system needs.
“The answers are out there. We have to be nimble enough and open enough to hear them,” Sovronsky told legislators during a confirmation hearing in March.
A national report published last year ranked Connecticut among the top 10 states for access to mental health care. Still, issues persist, particularly in the face of a “dramatic increase in demand” for services, Sovronsky told legislators.
“We should all be proud that Connecticut has one of the most highly developed behavioral health systems in the country,” he said. “Yet individuals and families continue to struggle, navigating a system that is fragmented and confusing.” 
Last year, the state Office of Health Strategy found that roughly 1.5 million residents lived in areas where the demand for mental health services exceeded the capacity of local providers. Statewide, adults earning low incomes reported feeling chronically depressed at five times the rate of those earning high incomes. Demand for mental health services for children, in particular, continues to climb. 
In his new role, Sovronsky will also help behavioral health providers receive timely payments from insurance carriers and advocate for greater access to behavioral health services.
In 2019, Connecticut passed a law requiring what’s known as “mental health parity,” meaning insurers cannot place greater restrictions on access to mental health services than on surgical or medical care. During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers added teeth to the measure, allowing the Insurance Commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance. 
During a hearing earlier this year, behavioral health providers testified that they often hear from patients who can’t access treatment they need because payers are less likely to provide adequate coverage for mental health services.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8544-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

The monitor’s latest report, released Thursday, Sept. 11, shows about 7.33% of the state experiencing “extreme drought” conditions.
“Extreme drought occurs when conditions are dry enough to cause water shortages, particularly for agriculture and for residents who rely on well water,” said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone in a Sept. 11 email to the Bulletin. Farmers in areas under this classification could see widespread crop loss, according to the National Weather Service.
The monitor relies on data tracking rainfall, stream flow, soil moisture content, reservoir levels, and more to draw its drought maps, according to the website. Extreme drought conditions are the third most extreme of four drought categories represented by the monitor. 
“This time of year, drought can enhance wildfire hazard and negatively impact fall foliage and crop health,” Stampone said. If the ground freezes before the drought ends, she added, it will become more difficult for the ground to “recharge” with groundwater — “essentially locking hydrologic drought in place through the cold season,” she said.
The state recommends mandatory water conservation measures during times of extreme drought, Stampone said, but whether to impose restrictions on water use is ultimately up to municipalities.
Across much of the rest of New Hampshire, a drought of lower classification is ongoing, with most of the northern half of the state experiencing “severe drought,” according to the monitor. Much of the rest of the state is experiencing moderate drought, leaving less than 10% of the state outside the drought conditions — although that area, which stretches between Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, is classified by the monitor as “abnormally dry.”
Despite a rainy spring and early summer, New Hampshire was plunged into drought conditions in a matter of weeks this summer. Stampone said in an interview with the Bulletin earlier in September that such a swing could become characteristic of the state’s changing climate, with rainy springs followed by the potential for hot, dry summers.
Though droughts have long been a reality in New Hampshire, they are becoming more intense with climate change, Stampone said then. The drought conditions have made for a challenging growing season for farmers across the state, who are contending with water scarcity they said has become a seasonal pattern.
And the speed with which the weather can swing from damp to dry makes it important to conserve water even when the need may not seem pressing, she added.
“When we do go into drought, we tend to go into it quickly,” she said. “Water conservation is something that should always be on our minds, even in times when we are wet.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nhdrought-1024x609.png,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

“This is an age of ideological turmoil, turmoil frequently manifested on our college campuses. The state of Florida and the UF administration and board leadership responded crisply to the post-Oct. 7 unrest. I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility,” Landry said. 
Landry’s confirmation came one day after the shooting death of political commentator Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
Landry was announced as UF trustees’ choice for interim president on Aug. 25. He started the job Sept. 1, but his position was not finalized until BOG approval.
The university needed to find a new interim president after former President Kent Fuchs’ interim contract expired. The first search for a president after the resignation of former President Ben Sasse ended with the BOG rejecting Santa Ono, former president of the University of Michigan. That meant another search couldn’t be completed before Fuchs’ contract expired.
“It’s been said by people in the last few years, especially in the last year, that the state of Florida, because of what we’ve done, we won’t be able to attract great presidential candidates. And if you look around the room, I think we’ve got some of the best presidents in the country,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said. 
Landry’s contract would pay him $2 million if he is not named UF’s formal president at the end of his interim stint.
UF trustees applying pressure to make interim leader permanent

The provision follows concerns that candidates might be scared to apply for the presidency if there was a chance they would end up jobless after quitting their previous job, like Ono did.
“We are excited to see what UF can accomplish under his leadership,” UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini said of Landry. Hosseini previously called Ono’s rejection “deeply disappointing.”
Landry’s contract will provide him a base salary of $2 million with a $500,000 performance incentive.
As president, Sasse was paid a $1 million base salary in a contract worth $10 million over five years. Florida State University President Richard McCullough just received a raised base salary of $1.25 million for the last year of his five-year contract.
“UF is on the ascendant and I enthusiastically endorse and will tirelessly work to achieve this aspiration,” Landry said, noting that UF is “clearly in the top five, arguably the best.”
The Board of Governors concluded its two-day meeting on New College of Florida’s campus with Landry’s vote. 
The University of Florida has yet to announce a new presidential search committee.

Sept. 10, 2025 | Photo courtesy of Michigan Energy, Michigan JobsHundreds of environmental advocates and community leaders gathered in downtown Lansing Wednesday for a day of action that included live music and commentary from activists and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
The event was led by Michigan Energy, Michigan Jobs, which included speakers in state Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Timmy Beson (R-Bangor Township), and state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing).
“Today’s event showed the strength and unity of Michiganders who know that clean energy is the key to strengthening affordability, creating healthier communities, and building a stronger economy,” Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director for Climate and Energy at the Natural Resources Defence Council said. “Seeing people from all walks of life gather at the Capitol demonstrates the broad support for policies that keep energy affordable, reliable, and homegrown here in Michigan.”
Those who participated in the event highlighted the economic benefits of clean energy, and the negative health impacts brought by fossil fuels. 
“Protecting the health of Michigan families must be at the center of energy policy,” Dr. Lisa Del Buono, board chair of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action said. “As clinicians, we see how fossil fuel pollution drives asthma and respiratory illness, especially in children and seniors. By accelerating the shift to clean, reliable energy, lawmakers can help ensure every child grows up breathing cleaner air.”
Attendees also advocated for community solar, which would allow Michigan communities to lower their energy bills by subscribing to a local solar energy project.
“Community solar is one of the smartest ways Michigan can grow its clean energy economy,” Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director for Vote Solar said. “These projects keep investment and decision-making local, creating jobs, strengthening our farms and businesses, and helping families save on their electric bills. By expanding community solar, we can deliver both energy independence and economic opportunity to communities across the state.”

(NOAA archive photo)Federal legislation introduced jointly by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, and Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, seeks to establish a fire weather program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The legislation passed the Senate unanimously on Sept. 10. 
“As a former aerial firefighter, one of my top priorities since taking office has been to reform our federal wildland firefighting apparatus to better protect our communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “The Fire Ready Nation Act ensures we can better predict these disasters and respond quickly to prevent the devastation to families, homes, and businesses that is caused by catastrophic wildfire.”
Fire weather describes certain conditions that lead to an elevated level of alert. Wind and humidity, for example, are two factors taken into account. Wildfire smoke is also tracked by federal agencies, and that information is then disseminated to the public. Many state agencies, including Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality, also track smoke impacts.
Earlier this year, Cantewell said more than 300,000 acres burned in Washington last year, and wildfires in California in January demonstrated the nation was facing “costly, unpredictable wildfires year-round.
“The Fire Ready Nation Act can help save homes and lives by giving scientists and weather forecasters on the front lines of wildfires innovative tools to better predict wildfire and smoke conditions,” Cantell said in a Jan. 30 press release.
The legislation is seeking to address a gap, a Cantwell release said.
“(NOAA) has no defined authority in law for its wildfire services. And while NOAA is a world leader in wildfire forecasting, better coordination and funding for new high-tech initiatives would help improve forecasting and preparedness,” the release stated.
The Department of Government Efficiency cut employees at the National Weather Service earlier this year, though the Trump administration has since sought to rehire them.
According to the bill text, program priorities include creating an improved fire-weather model that includes variables important for firefighters to know. It also asks the agency to implement artificial intelligence and cloud computing when creating the program. There’s also an ask for “a rapidly deployable network of rain gauges for post-fire hazard monitoring,” the bill states.
The hope is to update and upgrade weather models and make that information easily available to those that depend on it.
In addition, the bill would also “establish and maintain” an Incident Meteorologist Service within the National Weather Service. It appears they would be providing on-site support services during weather incidents that includes fires.
The bill also asks for various working groups to address issues, including communication between different agencies. It’s asking for an appropriation of $118 million over the next five years, according to the bill text.
Statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center say that more than 48,000 wildfire incidents have been reported year-to-date. Those fires have burned 4,320,279 acres across the country this year.
Fires have been a focus for Sheehy, with the Fire Ready Nation Act his second piece of fire legislation that’s passed the body unanimously. Prior to his Senate term, Sheehy co-founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company that operates a fleet of water-scooping aircraft.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/5083386035_8a18a32373_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 20:20:27+00:00,CT Mirror,Western Mass. working to halt sewage flowing into CT,"Hallie Claflin, CommonWealth Beacon",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/western-mass-sewage-ct-river/,The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by sewer overflows that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.,"Reports of toilet paper, raw sewage, and other discarded items flowing through the Connecticut River in Suffield and Enfield went viral in recent weeks as Connecticut state Rep. Tami Zawistowski pointed the finger at Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee.  
“They all have issues that have emerged in recent years,” Zawistowski told WTNH News 8, claiming Holyoke alone “dumped” seven million gallons of sewage into the river in one day. “It’s time for Massachusetts to step up.” 
Officials in the cities that have been singled out say the “issues” that have emerged are intensifying rain events due to climate change.  
The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.  
Cities like Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee have historically combined sewer systems where both wastewater and stormwater come through shared pipes. During heavy rains, the excess flow bypasses the treatment plants where it is supposed to be cleaned and is instead discharged into local bodies of water to prevent backups in people’s homes.  
All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent overflows and have reached the final stages of separating their stormwater and sewer systems, significantly reducing their annual discharges. But as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress. 
Funding the expensive projects required to update the sewer systems is a daunting task, and the three Gateway Cities often lack the taxpayer base to pay for it.  
“By no means would I say that Chicopee, Holyoke, and Springfield have done nothing,” Springfield Water and Sewer Commission Executive Director Josh Schimmel said. “If we could wave a wand and make them go away tomorrow, we would, but we serve a disadvantaged population that pays for it.” 
Mary Monahan, interim director of Holyoke Public Works, said the city has already eliminated 70 percent of the overflows outlined in their legally binding performance improvement plan established with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Justice Department. Previous CSOs in Holyoke violated federal and state wastewater discharge permits, according to the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. 
“On a normal day, we’re only using half the capacity of the plant,” Monahan said. “It’s only this rainfall that overwhelms it. Climate change is definitely exacerbating this issue.” 
Two projects amounting to $22.5 million are in the works now. River Terrace Phase A and B will continue the city’s efforts to separate the two systems and mitigate CSO events. Holyoke generally secures funding for CSO projects through the EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which offers no interest loans.  
Last year, the city applied for a $19 million grant through the EPA’s Community Change Grants Program, a Biden-era initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that provides funding to disadvantaged communities for environmental projects. While waiting in the queue to be funded, the program was cancelled in May by the EPA under the Trump administration.  
The grant was going to help fund a new centrifuge in Holyoke’s treatment plant, which removes liquid from the waste sludge and lowers disposal costs. It is expected to cost between $3 million and $4 million.  
“For a city like Holyoke, it really is a financial burden,” Monahan said. “Our ratepayers are paying almost $2 million a year in debt service, and River Terrace Phase B is going to add more.”  
The city is required to report the volume of discharge associated with CSOs each time there is a rain event. While Zawistowski was correct in claiming that seven million gallons had been discharged into the river in one day, Monahan estimates that nearly five million of that had already been treated in their plant. She says the city is working on revising how they report CSO volumes.  
“Ninety-nine percent of the overflow could be rainwater, which is technically clean, and 1 percent of it could be the sewage that was in the pipe,” Chicopee Water Pollution Control project supervisor Quinn Lonczak said. “It’s hard to know what is actually going out.”  
Monahan and Lonczak, along with city officials from Springfield, say they want to see the Connecticut River clean as much as anyone else does.  
“If it’s a regional rain event and all of the other plants are overflowing, sure, there’s going to be water quality issues and everything coming downstream,” Monahan said. “We’re really easy to pick on.”  
In Chicopee, between 80 and 85 percent of the city’s average annual discharge has been eliminated, according to Lonczak. Between 60 and 65 percent of their long-term CSO control plan projects have been completed. Since 2000, the city has spent close to $250 million on CSO-related projects. 
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not a cheap fix. And it’s not something that we ignore,” Lonczak said. “We’ve done a lot of projects here, spent a lot of money, and nearly all of that money is local. Our ratepayers here are paying for those projects.”  
While making considerable progress, Lonczak anticipates that completing the targeted projects will cost another $100 million before inflation. Some parts of the system are still combined, but don’t discharge a significant amount. He said the challenge is that now the city is left with project areas that will cost a lot but will ultimately remove only a small amount of overflow.  
A Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection report released in May showed that 543 million gallons of wastewater overflowed into the Connecticut River last year across 12 days with weather events, compared to nearly one billion gallons in 2023.  
“There’s a plan, and it may not be going as fast as the state of Connecticut wants, unless somebody starts writing some checks,” Lonczak said. “If you wanted to eliminate CSOs in Chicopee in five years … is it possible? Anything’s possible, it’s just the dollar amount.” 
Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the EPA.  
“We can handle regular rain. We’re going to get an inch and a half of rain over 12 hours? That’s no problem. We’re designed for that,” Lonczak said. “It’s short-duration, high-intensity events.”  
Springfield is less concerned with separating their sewer systems, according to Schimmel. Their CSO elimination projects involve a mix of separation in some areas, increased treatment plant capacity, and creating in-system storage. He says complete separation could solve one problem while creating another.  
“You can eliminate 100 percent of CSOs, and storm water alone is going to violate water quality standards every time it rains,” Schimmel said. “Although storm water is more dilute pollution by volume, it’s every bit as harmful as CSO. Separation reduces your combined sewer overflow, but it increases your stormwater.”  
Springfield has spent approximately $300 million on CSO projects, according to Schimmel, which have eliminated more than 50 percent of its CSOs in the last two decades.  
In the years following the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, the construction of wastewater treatment plants was largely paid for by the federal government through grants. Local entities paid a small portion of the cost. Municipalities must now pick up most of the cost, while state and federal agencies finance small, if any portions of their projects, Schimmel added. 
“There’s never been free money since the 70s and early 80s for any of us to do CSO work,” he said. “The pendulum has swung completely to the other side. It needs to come back to the middle to some degree.”  
He takes issue with river alliance and environmental advocacy groups referring to the city as “polluters.”  
“How about you put all of that effort into advocating your state legislators to get us money to fix the problem?” Schimmel said.

A small but pensive crowd gathered together Thursday morning at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter to observe the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.
People silently entered the Wall of Honor, which is in the center portion of the cemetery, via a walkway flanked on each side by members of the Rhode Island Patriot Guard Riders standing at attention, holding flags. 
Debbie Kane of The Rhode Island Highlanders played the bagpipes before the speaking program began. 
Among those who delivered remarks was Lt. Col. Andrew C. Cairns, professor of the University of Rhode Island’s ROTC program, who shared his memory of watching the clear blue sky fill with smoke across the New York skyline from his high school classroom in New Jersey.
Other speakers were The Rev. William Reynolds of the Beacon Church in Exeter; Paul Murgo, administrator of the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and George Lieb of the Exeter #1 Volunteer Fire Department. 
Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, presented a proclamation to William Pennoyer of the American Legion. The proclamation states that new legislation passed this year by the General Assembly allows teachers or administrators in Rhode Island public schools to hold a brief moment of silence after the pledge of allegiance on the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001. The new law, ceremonially signed Thursday afternoon by Gov. Dan McKee, was modeled on a measure enacted in New York to commemorate the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon.
Followed by the bugle call of the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team playing “To The Colors.”
The ceremony continued with the laying of a memorial wreath, the reading of the names of the Rhode Islanders lost in the attacks, and the “Striking of the Four Fives” — a ceremonial ringing of five bell strikes repeated in four series, a tradition that signifies the death of a firefighter in the line of duty.
Exeter Town Council Vice President Ray Morrisfield gave the crowd a few words to contemplate before the ceremony ended with a rifle volley by the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team, standing high upon a hill.
“Up to 9/11, we would say let the dead rest in peace, but today let us say, let the living live in peace,” Morrisfield said.

(Photo by Brandon O’Connor, NRCS/USDA )The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it had improved and expanded its Farm to School Grant program and would invest up to $18 million to connect locally grown food to child nutrition programs. 
The Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants program was initiated in 2013, but according to a news release, the fiscal year 2026 investment represents the “largest total amount” the department has offered in a given year. 
The Farm to School Grant announcement was made alongside U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s latest Make America Healthy Again report, which called for more whole, unprocessed foods in children’s diets.

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the grants are “one of the best ways we can deliver nutritious, high-quality meals to children, while also strengthening local agriculture.” 
“These grants will open new doors for small family farms, expand access to healthy food in schools, and inspire the next generation of Great American Farmers,” Rollins said in the news release. 
State agencies, tribal organizations, child nutrition programs, nonprofits, agricultural producers and groups of producers can apply for grants from $100,000 to $500,000 to support new and existing farm to school projects, according to the grant website. 
Eligible projects are those that: incorporate more unprocessed and locally produced foods in school meals, encourage the consumption of fresh foods, train producers on food safety and procurement requirements or educate students on agriculture and nutrition.
The release from USDA said updates to the program will also streamline the application process, remove barriers to innovation and emphasize partnerships.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, USDA is proud to streamline this program, so it works better for families, farmers, and communities across our nation,” Rollins said in the release. “Putting America’s Farmers First starts with putting our children first.”
According to USDA’s latest Farm to School Census, more than 440 Iowa school food authorities, the entities that manage school food service, have participated in the program.
The grants can also be used to support agriculture education at schools through things like ag and nutrition classes, or school gardening programs. According to the census, nearly 50% of Iowa school food authorities had classroom programs and slightly more than 15% of Iowa school food authorities had edible gardens. 
According to USDA, Farm to School Grant awards totaled $100 million since 2013. 
The millions in Farm to School Grant dollars are significantly less than the billions of dollars that schools and food banks used under a pandemic-era program to support local food purchases. 
These programs, Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance, were canceled in March after USDA announced in October 2024 over a $1 billion in funds to continue the programs across the country. 
Tommy Hexter, the policy director for Iowa Farmers Union, said the new investment from USDA is positive, but said it doesn’t make up for the loss of programs that provided “vital government support” to food farmers and players in the local food system.
Hexter said the canceled programs created relationships between farmers, food hubs, the state department of agriculture, schools and community, that are “fundamental to our food system in Iowa.”
“The first and foremost thing with this announcement is like, yes, let’s see how we can take advantage of this new announcement and make these programs come to Iowa,” Hexter said. “But we also are acknowledging that this investment does not replace the major loss of funding that happened earlier this year.”

From January through August, Arkansans bought $193.1 million in medical marijuana products from the state’s dispensaries, compared with $182.5 million in the same period last year, according to a press release from the state Department of Finance and Administration.
“With daily sales averaging about $800,000 in 2025, we are on track to surpass the 2023 sales record of $283 million,” department spokesperson Scott Hardin said.
There has also been a significant year-to-year increase in the number of pounds of cannabis sold, Hardin said, with the 2025 total at 52,292 pounds.
The state collected $5.38 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana in July and August, bringing the total tax haul so far this year to $21.57 million.
Patients spent $24,262,201 in July, purchasing 6,721 pounds, and $24,647,170 in August, buying 6,778 pounds, according to the finance department.
Suite 443 in Hot Springs and Natural Relief Dispensary in Sherwood sold the most medical marijuana in both July and August, according to the press release. Suite 443 sold 1,419.6 pounds total for both months. Natural Relief sold 1,317.7 pounds over July and August.
“A total of $1.5 billion has been spent on medical marijuana since the state’s first dispensary opened in May 2019,” Hardin said.
The Arkansas Department of Health reports 109,060 active patient cards. The Medical Marijuana Commission has licensed 38 dispensaries but only 36 are operating, Hardin said. The license of one of the closed dispensaries was revoked by the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board last year, and its owner’s appeal of the revocation remains before the courts.

Restoring Every Aspect of Life begins with hope and someone by
your side while you take the first step.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Recovery is REAL in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom.","Every September, communities and care providers across the nation,including in the Northeast Kingdom (NEK) of Vermont, recognize NationalRecovery Month, a time to celebrate the millions of Americans who are inrecovery from mental health and/or substance use disorders—and torecommit to breaking down barriers to treatment.
This year’s theme, Recovery is REAL (Restoring Every Aspect of Life),highlights the truth that recovery goes far beyond abstinence. It’s aboutrestoring health, a sense of purpose and overall wellbeing. But achievingthese goals often depends on one critical factor: access to recovery services.
Why Integrating Recovery Services into Primary Care MattersRecovery begins with hope and the conviction that healing and change arepossible. Building on an individual’s strengths, readiness, and availableresources; recovery is a holistic process that extends beyond symptommanagement to encompass the whole person.
For nearly 20 years, Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) has embracedholistic, patient-centered care through the integration of mental health andsubstance use (behavioral health) services within their Primary Carepractices throughout Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. Because of this,NCHC’s Primary Care practices provide not only a medical entry point, butalso a cornerstone of recovery. NCHC’s Primary Care providers are often thefirst and most consistent point of contact, ensuring whole-person care thatintegrates physical health, mental health, social health, and substance usesupport.
“I have heard for years, and from many patients, that it is reassuring toknow that we see them and care for them as entire beings, and not just aspatients with substance use disorder. And that it makes it comfortable andconvenient to receive all services in one place,” says Jeri Wohlberg, FamilyNurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s AssistantMedical Director.
Jeri Wohlberg, Family Nurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s Assistant Medical Director; and Brook
Marcotte, RN at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator discussing recovery with a patient.
“This program and the ones (who) run it, saved my life. I’ve never felt socomfortable with a medical team before,” said a patient in recovery fromsubstance use disorder (SUD) with NCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.
Substance Use Disorder (SUD)A substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic but treatable medical condition.It occurs when someone continues using alcohol, drugs, or other substancesdespite harmful effects on their health, relationships, or daily life.
In 2022, more than 1 in 6 Americans aged 12 and older reported having aSUD. SUDs can range from mild to severe and can affect anyone, regardlessof race, gender, income, or background.
Substances linked to SUDs include:

 Alcohol
 Cannabis
 Hallucinogens
 Inhalants
 Opioids (prescription and illicit)
 Sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety drugs
 Stimulants (like cocaine or methamphetamine)
 Tobacco/nicotine

Substance use disorders can happen to anyone. Some people begin usingsubstances to cope with trauma, stress, or mental health conditions. Othersdevelop SUD after being prescribed opioids for pain. Over time, substanceuse can change the brain, creating strong cravings that drive continued use.
Treatment and RecoveryRecovery looks different for every person – there is no single “right way.” Forsome, recovery may include counseling, medical treatment including medication, or peer groups; for others, it may involve faith, family support, or self-care practices. Often, it’s a combination.
Because SUD is complex and requires a personalized approach, NCHCPrimary Care teams provide a variety of options for patients including accessto compassionate and specialized staff to address many key components ofrecovery:

Behavioral health care and counseling staff, including psychiatry, forsupport with related mental health needs, understanding triggers andbuilding coping skills, and encouraging patient participation inmeaningful daily activities—like work, school, caring for loved ones,volunteering, or exploring creative outlets.
Community Health Workers and Peer Support Workers to connectpatients and families to community resources (housing, food,transportation), facilitate access to social services, self-managementprograms and peer support groups, and provide guidance andencouragement.
Licensed medical Primary Care providers (Doctors, Nurse Practitioners,Physician Assistants) to maintain a schedule of ongoing checkups andtreatment. Many are trained to prescribe medications that reducecravings or ease withdrawal like those used for Medication for OpioidUse Disorder (MOUD) (formerly known as Mediation AssistedTreatment or MAT), or to provide referrals to specialized care when itisn’t available right in the practice.
MOUD specialists to coordinate medical care, use of medications,counseling and behavioral therapies, and support services to provide awhole-patient approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder.

Reducing StigmaPeople with SUDs often struggle to stop using substances, even when theyunderstand the risks, and even when services like those at NCHC PrimaryCare practices are available. Overcoming SUD almost always requires morethan “willpower.”
Addiction stigma, the negative and unfair belief that those who developSUDs are morally weak and that they should “just quit,” often keeps peoplefrom seeking help. Over time, stigma may become internalized and leadpeople to believe that they are of lesser value or unworthy of help becausethey can’t tackle SUD on their own.
Understanding SUD as a health condition—and not a personal failure—canmake it easier for individuals and families to access life-saving treatmentand long-term recovery. This understanding and compassionateenvironment is one that NCHC Primary Care practices seek to cultivate.
“The research shows us that the biggest reason people don’t reach out forhelp with substance use is stigma, and anecdotally, this is what I hear frompatients. It is both heart-breaking and affirming when patients say, ‘I wish I’ddone this 20 years ago.’ We still have a long way to go, but when I hear that,I know that we have provided a safe space where people feel heard andsupported –and I know we’re on the right track,” says Brook Marcotte, RN atHardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator.
When this type of care is available, recovery is not only possible—it ishappening every day. “My MAT RN is amazing and is so helpful and kind,and I believe she actually cares about my recovery. She is always advocatingfor me, listens to me and helps me in any way that I need,” says a patient atNCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.

(Photo: NCGA livestream) Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall held a rare joint press conference Thursday to announce plans to bring forth a comprehensive package in September to address violent crimes. The two legislative leaders connected the August 22 murder of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail system with Wednesday’s assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
“I’ll start by acknowledging today being September 11th and the tragic time in our country 24 years ago,” said Hall. “Unfortunately, as we stand here today, another tragic time in our country with the murder of Charlie Kirk yesterday, and for us here in North Carolina coming on the heels of a tragedy on the Charlotte transit system with the murder of the Ukrainian refugee.”
Hall said while they are still in the “homework stage” of determining what happened in Zarutska’s case, it was clear to him that it was largely the result of the judicial magistrate allowing the suspect, a repeat offender, to walk out of jail on the promise to reappear in court at a future date.
Michael Whatley, the Republicans’ presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026, joined the press conference to honor Kirk’s legacy and find fault with former Gov. Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for Senate seat.
“There is a crime crisis here in North Carolina and across the country brought about by the left’s soft on crime policies. Roy Cooper has a history of being soft on crime,” said Whatley.
The former chair of the Republican National Committee said leaders in Democratic Party need to call out hateful rhetoric that is leading to violence.
Both Whatley and Berger pointed to the Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice (TREC), formed in 2020 by then-Gov. Cooper to address systemic racial bias in the criminal justice system.
Berger said that Zarutska’s life was tragically cut short because of the “atrocious policies pushed by out of touch politicians and court officials” that prioritize a “perverted vision” of equity and social justice.
TREC was tasked with submitting an annual report with legislative and municipal recommendations. It would be up to North Carolina’s legislature to decide which of those policies to advance.
But Berger said such recommendations could be problematic.
“What they do is they reflect an attitude on policing, an attitude on how things ought to be taking place,  and those attitudes in many respects are the things that inform the kinds of decisions that were made by the magistrate in this case,” said Berger.
Restarting the death penalty 
When the House and Senate return on September 22nd, Republican leadership will propose a package of policies to address crime.
“We can start by ensuring that Governor Stein and other members of the executive branch cannot establish any future task forces like the one Roy Cooper created that advanced weak-on-crime policies that kept Iryna’s murderer on the streets,” said Berger.
Berger also pledged to personally look for ways to restart North Carolina’s death penalty.
“Republicans in the General Assembly have attempted to restart the death penalty over the past decade and a half but those efforts have been stymied at every turn,” said the Senate leader.
There has been a de-facto moratorium on the death penalty in North Carolina for almost 20 years. President Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday that the suspect in the Charlotte case should be given a quick trial and the death penalty.
“There can be no other option,” Trump wrote.
Screengrab from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social Account on September 10, 2025.
Berger said legislators would also work to end cashless bail and keep repeat offenders in jail.
Speaker Hall said the forthcoming legislation would include more oversight of magistrates.
“Looking at the way that we select magistrates, making sure that the folks who are making these decisions are paying attention to what they’re doing and that they’re trying to serve public safety, not some left-wing interest,” Hall said.
Hall said the legislature would also examine the budgets of both Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to determine if any outside grants may have influenced magistrates to oppose cash bail. Advocate for bail reform have argued previously that cash bail disproportionately impacts the poor.
“Ultimately, we’re dealing with two local governments that in my opinion have lost institutional control of their areas,” said Hall.
Neither Berger nor Hall suggested that the new legislative package would include gun control.
“You know the murderer in Charlotte killed this young lady with a knife. A gun had nothing to do with it,” Hall told reporters. “Again, it’s a problem of local officials being soft on crime.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Speaker-Hall-09112025a-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

North Dakota and 11 other states are advocating for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the arguments of North Dakota ranchers in a dispute with an energy company.
WBI Energy used eminent domain to take a portion of the northwest North Dakota landowners’ property for a pipeline project in 2018. The ranchers were compensated for their land under a confidential settlement with WBI in 2021, though the parties disagreed as to whether the group was also entitled to legal fees.
A North Dakota federal judge initially ordered WBI to pay the landowners about $380,000 in legal expenses, though the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal overturned that decision earlier this year.
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

In early August, the landowners filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate court’s decision. They ultimately want the high court to reverse the circuit court’s ruling.
Twelve Republican-led states in a Monday friend-of-the-court brief took the landowners’ side.
Bob McNamara, the lead attorney representing the McKenzie County property owners, said it’s “remarkable” to see so many states come together in support of the ranchers’ petition.
The dispute centers on whether the parties have to follow federal or state law.
WBI took the ranchers’ land under a federal law called the Natural Gas Act, which allows private businesses to use the federal government’s eminent domain power for public natural gas infrastructure. While the landowners were paid for their land, the act doesn’t say whether that sum must also include landowners’ legal expenses.
Both the plaintiffs and the 12-state coalition that filed Monday’s brief take the stance that when federal law is silent, state property law governs.
Under North Dakota law, WBI is required to pay their attorney fees, the ranchers say.
WBI and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals disagree. The 8th Circuit in its ruling said that because  WBI wielded the federal government’s eminent domain power when it took the land, state law does not apply. When the federal government exercises eminent domain, it doesn’t have to cover property owners’ legal costs.
Allowing the appellate court’s ruling to stand would upset the balance of power between states and the federal government, the states argue in their Monday filing.
“Under the Eighth Circuit’s decision, landowners in seven states no longer have the benefit of state law property rights that landowners in the rest of the country have,” the brief says.
North Dakota landowners want to bring eminent domain case to US Supreme Court

The states expressed concern that the 8th Circuit’s legal interpretation could allow the federal government to quietly assume more regulatory authority over property-related matters.
WBI has to file a response to the landowners’ petition sometime in October, McNamara said. WBI declined a request for comment Thursday.
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to consider the petition sometime in November, he added.
It’s extremely rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to review a case, though the justices have shown an interest in eminent domain and property rights issues, McNamara said previously. 
He said the states’ brief could help put the case on the high court’s radar.
“The court listens to states when they say, ‘This creates a big federalism problem,’” McNamara said.
The 11 states that signed onto the brief with North Dakota are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)While union membership dips nationally, a new report by the Illinois Economic Policy Institute and Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois says two states that have strengthened laws on collective bargaining rights in recent years are seeing union membership increase.
In 2022, Illinois voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting bargaining rights. Illinois reported its first non-pandemic increase in unionization since 2017, with 27,000 union members added in 2024, according to the report.
Michigan repealed its “right-to-work” law in 2023, and gained 15,000 members in 2024 after years of union membership decline, the report shows. Michigan’s action was the first reversal of a state “right-to-work” law in decades, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. With the change, unionized workplaces can now require union dues or fees as a condition of employment. 
As a key labor union pushes into the South, red states push back

States have been active in recent years when it comes to determining the balance of bargaining rights between workers and employers.
In February, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a ban on collective bargaining for public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, firefighters and transit workers. The law is considered among the most restrictive in the country. 
Labor advocates have since collected enough signatures to put a voter referendum on Utah’s 2026 ballot that could overturn the ban. 
In Wisconsin, a county judge ruled last December that a 2011 Republican-backed law banning collective bargaining for most public employees violated the state’s constitution. His decision is being appealed before the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.
Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington state this year expanded bargaining rights for agricultural cannabis workers and ferry workers and corrections workers. Maryland enacted a locally supported law giving bargaining rights to sheriff’s deputies in Calvert County, southeast of Washington, D.C..
Bills that would have expanded bargaining rights for public-sector workers in Nevada and Virginia were vetoed by Republican governors.
Adjusting for occupation, geography, education and demographics, union membership offered an average 8.5% boost in wages in the United States between 2022 and 2024, the report found.
Twenty-six states now have “right-to-work” laws, in which employees at a unionized workplace are not required to pay union dues even if they’re covered by the bargaining agreement. The Illinois researchers say such laws, along with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling barring mandatory union fees for public employees, are major drivers of declining union membership nationally.

Free.,Trump commemorates Charlie Kirk alongside 9/11 victims,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-commemorates-charlie-kirk-alongside-9/11-victims,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump honored slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as he remembered the victims of Sept. 11 during a ceremony Thursday in Virginia, and announced he would posthumously award the popular figure the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Kirk, the late co-founder and head of the political advocacy organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on a college campus in Utah.Trump described the attack as a “heinous assassination” and told a crowd gathered at the Pentagon that Kirk, 31, was “a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.”“We miss him greatly. Yet I have no doubt that Charlie's voice and the courage he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on,” Trump said.Trump said the ceremony to posthumously award Kirk the highest civilian honor has not yet been scheduled but that he expects “a very big crowd.”In recalling the deadliest attack on the United States, Trump said the “entire world came crashing down” for loved ones of the 2,977 victims.“In the quarter of a century since those acts of mass murder, 9/11 family members have felt the weight of missed birthdays and empty bedrooms, journals left unfinished and dreams left unfulfilled,” Trump said. “To every member that still feels a void every day of your lives, the First Lady and I unite with you in sorrow and today, as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget September 11, 2001.”The president delivered remarks following Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who praised Kirk as a “good and faithful servant.” Hegseth said when faced with the tragic memory of 9/11 he finds hope in the “future of our great nation,” and invoked Kirk.“The young soldiers who take the oath give me hope. The young cops who wear the badge give me hope. The young firefighters who answer the call give me hope. The young agents who patrol our border give me hope. The life, example, and even death of Christ-follower and American patriot Charlie Kirk give me hope, sheer courage, no matter the arena,” Hegseth said.Vance in UtahVice President J.D. Vance, who had been scheduled to attend the 24th observance of 9/11 at Ground Zero in New York City, changed his travel plans to visit with Kirk’s family in Utah and fly with his casket to Arizona on Air Force Two, according to multiple media reports.Trump did not cancel a scheduled visit to a New York Yankees game Thursday night as part of a 9/11 commemoration.Vance issued a lengthy statement on social media Wednesday night sharing the story of his friendship with Kirk, including an acknowledgement they were both skeptical of Trump in 2016 before joining the president’s political agenda.“So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene. He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government,” Vance wrote.Kirk’s advocacy organization worked with Trump’s 2024 campaign to mobilize young voters in the November election.On Wednesday, Kirk was on the first of a 15-stop “American Comeback Tour” that was scheduled next week for events at Colorado State University.The zealous political figure was known for his outreach and events on college campuses. According to Turning Point USA, the organization has started over 1,000 chapters in high schools and 800 on college campuses across the U.S.Political violence Kirk’s killing is the latest in a string of politically motivated violence in recent years. A man fatally shot former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband in June. The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, also shot and injured Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter had in his possession several weapons and a list of several Minnesota and federal lawmakers, including some of their home addresses, according to authorities.During last year’s presidential campaign, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump during an event in Pennsylvania. Just over two months later, another man attempted to shoot Trump at his golf course in Florida.In 2022, a man wielding a hammer and zip ties broke into then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and fractured the skull of Paul Pelosi, the Democratic leader’s husband.On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of people stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. At least seven people died during or shortly after the attack and approximately 140 police officers were injured by the rioters.",,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s State Planning Council on Thursday approved a $10 billion blueprint for the next decade of transportation projects, even as questions linger over the availability of federal funding and the state’s ability to meet its own climate goals.
State officials must meet a Sept. 30 deadline to adopt the latest State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and send it to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for final approval or risk losing funding for future construction and rehabilitation projects.
“If y’all don’t approve this, starting Oct. 1, I can no longer approve reimbursements in Rhode Island,” warned Derek Torrey, Rhode Island administrator for the federal agency who sits on the council in an ex-officio role.
The State Planning Council is tasked by federal law with adopting a new STIP at least every four years. The STIP must present a four-year program, by year. Future projects are considered for informational purposes by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The project pipeline approved during the meeting held at the Department of Administration covers hundreds of projects for federal fiscal years 2026-2035, with 76% of capital spending being allocated toward the state’s roads and bridges. Notable projects include adding new lanes through the section of I-295 known as the “Cranston Canyon,” reconfiguring ramps near the state offices exit in Providence, and completing reconstruction of the new Route 6/10 interchange.
Even the rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge got listed as one of the notable line items in the draft STIP.
But just how many of those projects will remain fully funded over the course of the blueprint is unclear as spending authorized under the Biden-era Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is scheduled to sunset at the end of September 2026.
“We don’t know what comes next,” Torrey said. “We would all, I think, love it if the next transportation bill gives us more money, but we can’t plan for it. I certainly hope it comes in that direction.”
Meredith Brady, the council’s secretary and an associate director at the state’s Division of Planning, said she’s optimistic that Congress will reauthorize spending, despite “a new set of priorities coming out of Washington.”
“In the past when we’ve had a lot of political conflict, we’ve also had some extensions of the transportation authorization bill as it stands,” Brady said.

Short on state climate goals?
The STIP was approved by the council 19-1, with GrowSmart RI Executive Director Scott Wolf being the sole dissent.
Wolf commended the state for including “excellent individual projects” such as plans to replace bridges at Westerly’s Amtrak station starting in federal fiscal year 2029. But he called the overall project pipeline a “status quo roadmap” for Rhode Island’s future transportation priorities, noting that spending toward mass transit and bike infrastructure represents 12% of spending in the latest STIP.
“We need to move in a more transit and bike and ped-friendly direction,” Wolf said. “We need to reverse this serious underinvestment in non car-centric transportation projects.”
The Division of Planning first made the draft plan public in late June and then held two public hearings in North Kingstown and Providence along with two virtual sessions to gather feedback by July 30. Members of the public could also submit written comments online. Comments were compiled in a 255-page hearing report, many calling for greater investment in other modes of transportation.
“The advantages of alternative transit are well documented, including wellness, fitness, emotional health, reduced transit costs for riders, and reduced carbon emissions,” wrote Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat.
Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat who sat in the audience of about a dozen people, most of them state employees, expressed concern that the lack of investment in alternative modes of transportation will hinder the state in meeting its Act on Climate goals. 
That’s the law passed in 2021 requiring the state to develop a plan to reduce all climate emissions from transportation, buildings and heating, and electricity to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-zero by 2050.
“If we’re not meeting those mandated benchmarks, we’re, as a state, liable,” she told the council. “People can sue us.”
The law allows citizens or organizations that believe the state is not upholding its responsibilities under the legislation to file suit in Rhode Island Superior Court starting in 2026.
Tasked with defending those lawsuits would be the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General. But Attorney General Peter Neronha hasn’t signed off on the latest project blueprint, according to a July 30 letter he sent to the council.
“As currently drafted, the STIP fails to take a forward-looking approach to achieving the State’s long-term goals, and falls far short of meaningfully furthering compliance with the Act on Climate,” Neronha wrote.
Brady said it’s not up to council to set policy.
“We’re just slotting the funding that we have into specific projects,” she said in an interview after the meeting. “And there are a lot of projects in the outyears that have the potential to positively impact our mode shift.”
Wolf wanted the council to amend the STIP to allow for additional investments but his suggestion was quickly rejected by other members of the panel after Brady stressed the need to get the STIP approved by the Federal Highway Administration before its Sept. 30 deadline. 
“First and foremost, we need to take action today,” she said.
Changes could always be made in the future, though they will require some sort of trade-off, Brady added.
“If you add a project, you need to remove a project or at least remove money from somewhere,” she said. “We can’t drop fiscal constraint.”

Kirk’s suspected killer remains at large and the manhunt continued on Thursday, with law enforcement announcing that they may have found the murder weapon – a high-powered, bolt-action rifle – in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. The FBI in Salt Lake City released two photos of a potential person of interest and asked for tips in helping apprehend the person.
After the shooting on Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared on social media that she was thinking of Kirk, his family and members of the community at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was killed. 
Before news of Kirk’s death, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) offered prayers for Kirk, his family and the students at Utah Valley University, emphasizing that political violence “has no place in our democracy.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) shared an article about Kirk’s death and stated “Political violence should be condemned by all decent people, no matter what your political leanings might be.”
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) also called for a stoppage in American political violence, calling it “wrong, anywhere, at any time, no matter what.

“This is horrifying. It’s tearing our country apart,” Dingell said.
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) said in a social media post that “the political violence in this country has got to stop.”
In the same vein, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate, said: “We all can have political disagreements, but violence is horrific and unacceptable.”
Calls for prayers, support for Kirk’s family abound
Following news of Kirk’s passing, several Michigan Republicans offered words in memorial of the 31-year old Turning Point USA founder.
U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) said Kirk “articulated conservative views to younger generations clearer than anyone.” 
“Solving political differences through violence has no place in our Nation, and these instances are becoming far too frequent. We must do better,” Bergman said. “Those of us who value free speech and conservative values vow to carry Charlie’s torch and pass it on for generations to come.”
Utah and federal law enforcement have yet to identify the shooter and their motive, but U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) said Kirk was martyred for his Christian conservative values. 
“Charlie was faithful even unto death – obedient to his convictions, bold in his witness, and steadfast in proclaiming the truth,” James said in a post to social media.
Michigan leaders warn of normalizing political violence
Alongside the state’s congressional delegation, several other Michigan leaders and candidates for office shared their thoughts on Kirk’s death. 
In a statement, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist said Wednesday’s shooting is another reminder that gun violence and politically-motivated violence, cannot be tolerated.
No matter who you voted for, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said there is no justification of violence of any kind. 
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

Michigan Republican Party Chair and State Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) said he and his wife were devastated to hear of Kirk’s death, praising his work with conservative student activists on college campuses. 
“The wave of political violence gripping our nation is un-American, and unpatriotic,” Runestad said. “No American should fear for their life because of their faith or their political views. I hope everyone in Michigan will join me in continuing to pray for Charlie’s family and the profound impact he had on our nation.”
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) issued a statement mourning Kirk’s death. 
“Charlie always emphasized that the minute we stop having discourse, the second we stop sharing ideas with each other, despite our differences, is when we will devolve into violence,” Nesbitt said.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is also running for U.S. Senate, said, “Even if we virulently disagree, we stand for free speech, and nowhere should free debate be more encouraged or protected than college campuses.”
Former Wayne County Health Director and Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate Abdul El-Sayed said that Kirk was practicing his right to free speech when he was shot. 
“Whatever our differences, we handle political disagreements with words and not violence in this country,” El-Sayed wrote in a post to social media. “That is the essence of what democracy is about.”
College political groups unify to condemn Kirk’s killing
Michigan College Democrats and Michigan College Republicans also issued a joint statement condemning the shooting. 
“Violence in any form has no space on our college campuses, end of story,” said Stella Camerlengo, president of the Michigan College Democrats. “As a generation, we have seen political violence plague Michigan and states across the country far too often. While our organizations may disagree on a lot, we can both come together to say that we vehemently refuse to accept a future where violence substitutes for dialogue.”
The two groups pointed to Wednesday’s shooting as a symptom of growing polarization in American politics, calling for disagreements to be sorted through loving, rational and good-faith debate.
“Terrorism has no place in American politics no matter what despicable way it manifests, and we will not be swayed.,” said Tyler Campbell, chair of the Michigan College Republicans. “We call all in our generation to sincerely learn from this tragedy, that we may preserve a united America.”

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres/Governor’s Office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law Thursday that establishes a new cabinet-level New Jersey Department of Veterans Affairs, separating housing, health care, and other benefits for veterans and their families from an existing state department that also handled military readiness and National Guard operations.
The move comes after state officials paid millions to settle lawsuits over hundreds of pandemic deaths in state-run veterans homes. The deaths prompted both federal and state investigations, which led the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney’s Office to order reforms and expanded oversight for care they deemed so abysmal that it violated residents’ constitutional rights.
The law, which is set to take effect in 120 days, reorganizes the existing Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two entities — the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Military Affairs.
Murphy plans to nominate Vincent Solomeno, now a deputy commissioner in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and a former superintendent of the National Guard Training Center in Sea Girt, to be commissioner of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Brigadier General Yvonne L. Mays, the adjutant general of New Jersey and commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, will remain commissioner of the Department of Military Affairs.
Sens. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex County) was a chief sponsor of the law.
“Veterans need to know their voices are being heard and their needs prioritized. This bill reflects that commitment by giving them a dedicated seat at the table and a department that works only for them,” Vitale said in a statement.

(Getty Images)  LEXINGTON — The University of Kentucky has fired a tenured faculty member who formerly oversaw the university’s equine drug-testing lab. 
Scott Stanley was removed as the head of UK’s former Equine Analytical Chemistry Laboratory last year following an investigation that alleged the lab failed to meet standards under his leadership. The investigation was conducted by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, which oversees drug testing of Thoroughbred racehorses.
The UK Board of Trustees approved revoking Stanley’s tenure by voice vote during a Thursday special meeting. Trustees asked questions of Stanley’s attorney, Cristina Keith, and UK lawyer Whitney Stepp-Gay and publicly debated the decision. Stanley had waived his right to a hearing.
“At the University of Kentucky, we are committed to advancing Kentucky through research and service of the highest quality,” said board Chair Britt Brockman in a statement following the meeting. “We must uphold the highest ethical standards and comply fully with university and industry regulations. Any violations of these policies are taken seriously and addressed to maintain the integrity of this work – the work of thousands of people across this institution.”
Keith told the Lantern after the board vote that her client was obviously disappointed with the outcome, but she could not say if Stanley would appeal the decision in court without speaking to him first. 
A university press release said that terminating a tenured faculty member is rare, but allowed under Kentucky state law. 
UK began the process to revoke Stanley’s tenure last fall after initial findings in an internal audit. One finding included a test that was commissioned by the Horseracing Integrity and Welfare Unit was never performed but Stanley had reported the result. 
Keith said in the board meeting in response to questions about the testing result that “without additional information, Dr Stanley cannot speak to this specific allegation” and questioned the integrity of the finding. She said there has not been a photograph of the alleged unopened sample. 
“In addition to that, all samples are received in more than one vial, so assuming that there was a discovery of one unopened vial in the EACL lab refrigerator, that is not conclusive evidence that no testing had been performed,” she said. 
Charges Stanley faced, according to UK’s press release, were: 

Failure to perform duties: Misrepresentation, falsification of test results and fraudulent billing
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Lack of internal controls (to prevent tampering and manipulation of data) and lack of oversight of EACL operations
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Conflicts of interest/commitment and improper hiring practices

Frank Shoop, a nonvoting member of the board who is member and past chairman of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, spoke about the importance of accurate and credible drug testing for horse racing. According to the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, the thoroughbred industry brings in $115 million in tax revenue for the state annually. 
Shoop said a prominent testing facility used to be at the University of California-Davis. 
“A lot of people in this state worked a lot of years to get this to the University of Kentucky,” Shoop said.

Attorneys who asked a judge to make the Bureau of Land Management comply with an appeals court ruling announced that the federal agency has put off its plans to eliminate some herds until next summer.
The post ‘Checkerboard’ horse whiplash continues, southwestern Wyoming roundups now delayed until 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","The on-again, off-again and heavily litigated roundup and elimination of more than 3,000 free-roaming horses from about 2.1 million acres of southwestern Wyoming is looking increasingly unlikely in 2025. 
Over the course of the last few months, the Bureau of Land Management’s plans have been OK’d administratively, but then appealed, delayed and found to be illegal by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal agency wasn’t fully deterred, however, and had scheduled the roundups for Oct. 13, triggering a Friends of Animals lawsuit aimed at stopping BLM from proceeding.

This week, more plaintiffs joined the fray with yet another lawsuit, seeking to block the 2025 removal operations, which will eventually eliminate the Salt Wells Creek Herd, Great Divide Basin Herd and northwestern portion of the Adobe Town Herd. Those pro-horse groups and individuals — American Wild Horse Conservation, Animal Welfare Institute, Carol Walker and Kimerlee Curyl — sent word Thursday that the federal government informed them the BLM’s plans have changed. 
“Late yesterday afternoon we heard from the Justice Department, which represents BLM, that … the roundup is not happening this year,” Bill Eubanks, an attorney for the petitioners, told WyoFile on Thursday. “It won’t happen before summer of 2026. That’s all we know. It’s just a written assurance by counsel.” 
The next step in the legal process is a status conference in the U.S District Court for Wyoming scheduled for early October. Attorneys will convene to discuss potential remedies to a 2-year-old Resource Management Plan amendment that the appeals court found to be illegal. The court ruled that the BLM didn’t demonstrate how eliminating horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance,” which is required by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. 
The ongoing dispute over the existence of the Salt Wells Creek, Great Divide Basin and Adobe Town herds goes back 15 years. In 2010, the Rock Springs Grazing Association revoked consent for the free-roaming horses to exist on its property within the 40-mile-wide swath of southern Wyoming where interchanging public-private land forms a checkerboard pattern.

This story by Randolph T. Holhut was first published in The Commons on Sept. 9, 2025.
EAST DUMMERSTON — Read and Malah Miller have been running the Dwight Miller Orchard for more than three decades. Their succession plan was to start passing the operation on to his children this apple season.
“This was going be a transition year for us,” said Malah Miller. “We didn’t expect it to be this way.”
A three-alarm fire on Aug. 16 destroyed the orchard’s packing house building that was home to their cold storage and produce coolers, their cider press and apple packing facilities, their retail area and their maple evaporator and sugaring equipment.
“Everything went up in this building,” said Read. “Everything except for the orchard is gone. This building was the brain, heart, and soul of all our functions.”
Also lost were 25,000 gallons of apple cider vinegar, 1,000 gallons of maple syrup and 400 quart jars of pickles that they had just finished making for this season. “You could hear the pickle jars exploding in the fire,” said Read.
But within days of the fire, Malah began making another batch of pickles.
“When life gives you cucumbers, you make pickles,” she said. “You have to keep moving.”
When a fire destroys your business, you find a way to move forward. For the Miller family, they have an orchard full of apples to harvest, and they are finding a way to use this disaster not to mark the end of an eight-generation Vermont farm, but as a new chapter in its long history.
Dividing up a big task
Standing in front of the ruins of the packing house three weeks after the fire, Read talked about how his family has divided up rebuild.
His children, Will and Martha, are busy with running the business and shaping what it will be in future years. Read said he is busy with the difficult task of dealing with the insurance companies and government regulators, cleaning up the debris and documenting the damage.
“It’s huge, the emergency stuff,” Read said. “There are tractor-trailer loads of steel that need to be removed. I have to document and come up with the replacement value for every bit of the building, its contents, and what it was used for. And all that has to be perfect.”
Read said the orchard’s insurance will cover most, but not all, of the losses.
As for operations in the short term, Read said that “we’re going to stick with doing what we are comfortable with doing.”
That starts with the organic orchard’s pick-your-own operation on Miller Road, which began on Sept. 6. It will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., throughout the autumn.
Apples will continue to show up at the Brattleboro Area Farmers Market, but it may be a while before the farm returns to making organic apple cider and apple cider vinegar.
Read said the family bought a complete cider making setup, which is expected to arrive at the farm this week.
The replacement for the destroyed packing building, which was built in 1962 by Read’s father, Dwight, using timber harvested from the family’s wood lots, will be constructed in a similar manner.
“We have a lot of resources here on the farm, and a lot of people who want to help us rebuild,” Read said. “We have the opportunity to stand on our forefathers’ shoulders to rebuild, but we will need the help of our neighbors to do so.”
Read said the family “has all been affected by the fire,” and the challenge is “finding ways to stay together and be positive. The most important job for us is to come together.”
Malah said that she and Read are making sure that the Miller children are being given “lots of room to make their own future.”
Gratitude for the help
The community stepped up for the Millers in a big way, donating nearly $97,000 to the orchard’s GoFundMe appeal that was started by Martha.
“That was the kids’ idea,” Read said. “Reaching out for help is something I’m not totally comfortable with, but I’m past the age to be embarrassed. But my father always said that when someone offers to help, it’s rude to not accept it.”
Assistance has also been offered by Green Mountain Orchards in Putney and other neighboring farms.
Read said the family is committed to keeping the community informed about the recovery process and will keep people up to date through social media.
And, next Aug. 16, Read said the family hopes to have a gathering to mark the first anniversary of the fire and the progress that the farm has made.
“We’re blown away by the support,” said Malah. “It has been very humbling, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to pay all that support forward.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Democrats are calling for Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation to support efforts to compel the release of information related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The Democratic National Committee launched a digital ad campaign Wednesday calling for Iowans to contact U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and “demand they release the files,” showcasing photos of Epstein and President Donald Trump together as well as of a suggestive birthday card allegedly signed by Trump that was released by Democrats on the U.S. House Oversight Committee on X Monday.
Releasing the “Epstein files” has been a point of contention in Congress for some time. Before the U.S. House recessed in July, there was a bipartisan attempt to compel the U.S. Department of Justice to release government investigative documents on Epstein, who died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges. House Republican leaders successfully stopped attempts to force the House to vote on this effort.

Though there are some Republicans calling for the release of the “Epstein files,” much of the push has come from Democrats, especially following news that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump his name appeared multiple times in government documents related to Epstein as well as the publishing of purported birthday letters from Trump to Epstein.
The members of Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation said in July they support publicizing more information related to the Florida financier, but that they backed the Trump administration and DOJ approach to releasing information, saying Democrats were using the issue for political gain.
The DNC ad campaign is specifically targeting Miller-Meeks, who represents Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. The district, containing cities including Iowa City, Davenport and Burlington, is predicted by political forecasters to be one of the most contentious races in the 2026 midterm elections.
In a statement on the ad campaign, DNC Chair Ken Martin criticized Republicans in Congress for “covering” for Trump by not supporting efforts to release more information on Epstein.
“If House Republicans can’t even stand up for the victims and survivors of a notorious sexual predator, if they won’t even call out the president for a blatant government coverup, then how can their voters trust them?” Martin said.
Miller-Meeks said in July that she stands with Trump “in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.”
Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also called for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson to vote in support of the discharge petition to release files related to Epstein. Wahls and Hinson are both running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who announced earlier in September she will not seek reelection.
Wahls wrote that in light of the Democrat James Walkinshaw’s victory in the Virginia U.S. House special election who has signed or pledged to sign the discharge petition on the Epstein files” only one more representative’s support is needed to force a vote on issue. Wahls called on Hinson to join the four other House Republicans currently supporting the effort.
“Congresswoman Ashley Hinson is single-handedly blocking the release of the Epstein files,” Wahls said in a statement. “Instead of standing with survivors and the American people, she’s actively participating in a cover-up with Donald Trump and the rest of the D.C. swamp. Iowans deserve a Senator who will fight for transparency and accountability—not one who protects the powerful and hides the truth.”
Hinson has previously said she trusts Trump, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel will “do the right thing” while pursuing justice and investigating Epstein.

The prescription is part of a standing order the health department announced on Thursday that is immediately effective and will remain so through of August of next year, unless withdrawn by Durham.
DOH Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM the department recommends residents either print out a copy of the prescription or have it available on their phones when seeking the vaccine.
The standing order also follows updated protocols issued last week by the state Board of Pharmacy. Those protocols had emerged in response to an Aug. 29 public health order that directed the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
As Source NM previously reported, the Pharmacy Board protocol governs pharmacies’ distribution of vaccines. Previously, the protocol required the pharmacies to follow guidelines set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. However, ACIP has yet to convene on current guidelines. In an interview with Source NM last week, NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said that lacking the ACIP guidelines, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
The revised protocol was intended to remove that problem. However, Nott said the department has “had some calls about pharmacists not understanding the order or still feeling like New Mexico residents need a prescription…With Dr. Miranda Durham’s signature on the prescription, you can use that as a prescription for a COVID [19] vaccine when you go to the pharmacy to eliminate any confusion about whether New Mexico residents need a prescription.”
A NMDOH news release notes that the standing order “addresses barriers that have prevented some New Mexicans from getting vaccinated. While most people could already receive vaccines through their providers, some pharmacists and healthcare providers were hesitant to vaccinate certain groups without formal prescription backup, particularly for off-label uses not specifically covered in FDA approvals.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but added new restrictions that make people over the age of 65 eligible, but requires younger people to have an underlying medical issue for eligibility. The state health department’s standing order allows off-label use by qualified providers — physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists holding an active and valid license in New Mexico — per professional guidelines and the health department’s recommendations. Those recommendations include providing vaccines “to any healthy person 2–64 years wishing protection.”
Thus the standing order “removes hesitation some providers had about vaccinating people who would benefit from the vaccine but fell outside the narrow FDA approval categories,” Durham said in a statement. “COVID-19 vaccines remain safe and effective tools for preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.”
In addition, the news release said, individuals enrolled in Medicaid will have the full cost of their COVID-19 vaccines covered.
The health department said anyone who is denied a COVID-19 vaccine should call the New Mexico Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
“We are clearing the way for New Mexicans who want the vaccine to get the vaccine,” NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “This standing order ensures that barriers don’t prevent people from protecting their health.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-12.40.55 PM-1024x700.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)In state legislatures around the country, medication abortion has emerged as the central focus of the fight over abortion rights. As Democratic lawmakers in blue states enact shield laws to protect abortion medication prescribers, their Republican counterparts — particularly in states that have banned abortion — are filing a flurry of bills to restrict access.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without total abortion bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Using medication to end a pregnancy requires taking two medications in succession: mifepristone to stop the pregnancy and misoprostol to induce contractions in the uterus to expel pregnancy tissue. These medications are also used by medical providers for other conditions, including to manage miscarriage and treat postpartum hemorrhage.
Research has shown medication abortion is effective and safe, with complications requiring hospitalization occurring in less than 0.3% of patients. Research also has shown medication abortion provided via telehealth is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Read on for an update on GOP-led state efforts to restrict access to abortion medication:
Reclassifying abortion pills as controlled substances
Last year, Louisiana — which has banned abortion — became the first state to pass a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled substances, in the same class as drugs such as  Xanax and Valium. Hospitals in the state have had to change how the drugs are stored, locking them in passcode protected containers outside of delivery rooms. Physicians in the state have said the new restrictions have interfered with or negatively impacted their treatment of patients.
Republican lawmakers in Kentucky, Missouri and Texas introduced similar legislation in their most recent legislative sessions, though all three bills died in committee.
More states are expected to follow Louisiana’s lead in the coming legislative session.
Banning and restricting telehealth abortions
While most abortions occur in person, telehealth is a growing provider. By the end of last year, 1 in 4 abortions was provided via telehealth, according to #WeCount, a national reporting effort by the Society of Family Planning, an abortion research organization.
About half of those were from providers practicing in states with shield laws who mailed abortion pills to people in states with telehealth restrictions, six-week abortion bans or total abortion bans.
Nine states currently have laws that explicitly ban telehealth-provided medication abortion, or ban the mailing of medication abortion drugs, according to KFF, a research and policy organization. Those are Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia.
Eight Democratic-led states have shield laws designed to protect providers who offer medication abortion via telehealth to patients across state lines: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
But GOP-led states are fighting back.
Lawmakers in at least 14 states have introduced bills to criminalize the purchase, prescription and distribution of medication abortion, according to Jennifer Driver, who tracks reproductive state policy for the State Innovation Exchange, an organization focused on passing progressive state legislation.
In July, 15 Republican attorneys general signed a letter urging Congress to ban such shield laws because, they said, the laws interfere with states’ ability to enforce their own criminal laws.
Allowing citizen lawsuits
This month, the Texas Legislature passed a first-of-its-kind bill that would allow Texans to sue physicians, manufacturers and others from outside the state who mail abortion medication into the state. It also bans the manufacturing of abortion drugs in Texas. It’s now headed to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it.
The law is expected to set up a legal fight over whether one state’s laws can be enforced in another state.
Meanwhile, a Louisiana law passed in June and dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” allows the mother of a fetus to sue out-of-state doctors and activists for performing or facilitating a medication abortion, and extends the window for such lawsuits from three years to five years.

“Once again, the House’s legislative priorities will be clear and informed from the start as we maintain our focus and energy on preparing for the 2026 legislative session,” he wrote recently of the select committees.
In MS, 52,000 can’t vote because of nonviolent records
Buckley told lawmakers that 46 other states allow some sort of automatic restoration of voting rights for people convicted of crimes who have completed their sentences. Mississippi is one of only four states with a difficult application process for restoration, and given that only 207 people here had their rights restored from 1997 to 2004, it’s process may be the most restrictive. It requires lawmakers to pass by a two-thirds margin in each chamber an individual bill for each person’s rights to be restored, or a governor’s pardon.
The Mississippi Constitution drafted in 1890 in the Jim Crow era of racial discrimination listed 10 disenfranchising crimes — offenses that state leaders at the time believed Black people were more likely to commit. Since then, attorneys general interpretations added many more nonviolent, disenfranchising crimes.
Buckley said about 52,000 Mississippians, or about 2% of the voting age population, currently cannot vote because they have nonviolent felony records.

Buckley said many states provide for automatic restoration of rights after someone serves their sentence, fulfills their probation or parole, and-or makes financial restitution. She said making it automatic saves states money and reduces bureaucracy. But she said making such changes in Mississippi would most likely require a change in the state constitution, a heavier lift requiring a statewide vote rather than just lawmakers passing a law.
Rep. Noah Sanford, a Republican from Collins co-chairing the select committee, said he believes reform of felony suffrage restitution can pass the House. Rep. Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall and co-chair, said Speaker White’s focus on the issue with the select committee will help suffrage reform legislation’s chances.
“I think there is broad consensus among House members that restoration of voting rights for nonviolent offenders is the right thing to do,” Sanford said. “But we are not kings, and there are two other levels it has to go through (the Senate and governor).”
MS has had on-again, off-again ballot initiative rights
Mississippians’ right to place issues directly on a statewide ballot is, technically, enshrined in the state constitution.
Mississippians had the right to ballot initiative starting in 1914, but the state Supreme Court threw it out in 1922. Voters restored the right by passing a constitutional amendment in 1992, but the Supreme Court again nullified it on a technical issue in a lawsuit over voters passing a medical marijuana initiative in 2020.
The right to initiative in the state constitution includes requirements for gathering voter signatures from Mississippi’s five congressional districts. But in 2001, the state lost a district from population loss, and the court ruled the initiative inoperative. Since then, despite calls from voters and advocates to restore it, lawmakers have dickered over details and signature thresholds and failed to restore the right.
Buckley told lawmakers Thursday that the simplest way to restore the right would be to change constitutional language on signature gathering from five districts to four, or have language adapting to whatever number of districts the state has at the time of an initiative effort.
Buckley said 23 other states, plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, have some sort of functioning ballot initiative process.
Lawmakers have debated how stringent the requirements for placing an issue directly before voters should be. Some fear sidestepping the state’s representative form of government could allow special interests with deep pockets to game the system. Others say the state’s previous requirements were too strict.

Buckley noted that, from 1992 until the high court ruling in 2021, Mississippi voters passed only three initiatives — one restricting eminent domain, one requiring voters to provide IDs and one (the court struck down) approving medical marijuana.
Mississippi’s ballot initiative in the past gave voters the right to change the state constitution. But lawmakers have also considered allowing it only for addressing state law.
Buckley said allowing it for state law might prove problematic because “when the public makes a decision, the Legislature could then change it back — what does that mean about the process?” She noted that states’ ballot initiative processes vary.
“No state really has a template,” she said. “Every state does it differently.”
Early voting faces uphill battle
Mississippi is one of three states — along with Alabama and New Hampshire — that does not allow in person early voting. In her presentation, she gave an example of the difficult process “Frank,” who would be out of town on Election Day, would have to go through to vote absentee beforehand in Mississippi.
Buckley said that in most states, in-person early voting “mimics most of Election Day practices.” She said it would reduce paperwork and clerical mistakes from Mississippi’s absentee voting process and mean shorter lines and less people walking away without voting on Election Day.
But early voting in Mississippi and other states has brought much debate, oftentimes partisan, with many Republican officials opposing it. Gov. Tate Reeves has been very vocal with his opposition to it.
Sanford said that of the three issues the committee is tackling, allowing early voting might face the most uphill battle.
“The governor remains opposed to early voting, and he’s made that extremely clear that it’s not subject to change,” Sanford said. “I’m not saying we are not going to work on early voting — compromise is the name of the game — but that may not be the focus as much as suffrage restoration and ballot initiative.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11114638/3X0A7482-1.jpg,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

Standardized test scores for Washington public school students improved slightly this year, according to data the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction released Wednesday.
But the scores remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and the test results show nearly a third of students are not meeting grade-level standards in math, while the same is true for about a quarter of students when it comes to English. 
There are stark disparities as well, with around half of the students in some racial and ethnic minority groups getting the lowest possible score on the math tests.

“We still have a ways to go,” Superintendent Chris Reykdal said during a press briefing. 
He added that growth in the test scores “is now not only exceeding the immediate post-pandemic struggles we had, but it’s at a faster trajectory of growth than even pre-pandemic.” 
Reykdal pointed out that across the U.S. and around the world, forces such as social media, economic stress, and the risk of violence in schools are posing obstacles for students. 
The state tests, administered each spring in grades three through eight and 10, are required by the federal government. They are designed to assess whether a student is on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses.
The Smarter Balanced Assessment used by Washington and 11 other states scores students on a 1-to-4 scale based on their test results.
Federal requirements call for the state to report level 3 and 4 scores “as meeting the standard of being on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses,” Katy Payne, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, said in an email yesterday. 
The data show that, overall, 50.9% of students are meeting this standard in English language arts and 40.7% in math. 
Last year, 50.3% of students scored a 3 or 4 on the English assessment, and 39.7% on the math tests. In the year before the pandemic, those figures were 59.6% for English and 48.9% for math.
Revised approach to interpreting scores
Payne said that in 2024, “after seeing how the state test score results were being mischaracterized across the nation,” Smarter Balanced, the vendor behind the tests, clarified that students who earn level 2 scores are also “demonstrating grade-level knowledge.”
OSPI now emphasizes that scores of 2 and up demonstrate “foundational grade-level knowledge and skills with a limited range of complexity.” 
Under this approach, the data shows that 70.9% of students are at or above grade level in English language arts and 63.3% of students are at or above grade level in math. 
Reykdal cautioned against equating low standardized test scores with failing academically in a subject, saying the tests are a point-in-time measurement intended to track trends.
He noted student data showing significant variability in their individual scores year-to-year as an example of why the standardized test isn’t a good measurement for an individual student’s success. 
“These assessments matter because it gives us important trend data for our state, and the more students assess, the better our accuracy,” Reykdal said. “But for any given student, gosh, if you had a bad day on a Thursday in May … you can get these kinds of results.” 
The trend data provided by the tests shows that Washington students are generally performing consistently with, or better than, their peers across the U.S., though Washington’s math scores have been steadily declining in relation to the performance of other states. 
Compared to the 11 other states that use the same assessment, last year’s test results show Washington ranked second overall in English and fourth in math.
The data also show that low-income students – defined as students who qualify for free or reduced lunch – consistently score lower than their higher-income peers. 
There are achievement gaps for several minority groups as well. For example, while 24.6% of white students scored only a 1 on the math assessment, the same was true for 47.6% of Black students, 53.9% of Native American students, and 56% of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.
“There are student populations that need additional investment,” Reykdal said. 
“Those kinds of investments have moved the needle, which is great, but the gap is still very large,” he added. 
Legislative request focused on math
In an effort to improve Washington’s math scores, Reykdal said he plans to ask the Legislature for $10 million to fund professional learning for teachers, with a focus on those teaching kindergarten through eighth grade. 
“They’re not math majors, and they don’t need to be, but they need targeted instruction on how to move kids, particularly those who are behind in math,” he said. 
The funding would also be used to teach schools innovative models for learning math and to buy statewide licenses for some software tools that would be made available to elementary school students.
“It’s time to complement the hard work of our teachers with tools that kids can get excited about and work on at home as well as in the classroom, all while we remind students that foundational work is something they’ve got to be able to do without assistive technology,” Reykdal said. 
Reykdal plans to make a separate request in next year’s legislative session for $110 million per year to offset inflationary cost increases for schools.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-10-at-5.11.01-PM-1024x622.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Photo courtesy Heinrich’s office)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and other Senate Democrats are calling on the Forest Service chief to explain alleged discrepancies in his accounting for ongoing payouts of thousands of Forest Service employees who opted into early retirements or resignations earlier this year. 
The lawmakers’ Sept. 9 letter notes that Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz has identified two contradictory funding sources for accrued sick leave and vacation payments to roughly 5,000 Forest Service employees who opted into the Deferred Resignation Program during government-wide buyouts this spring. 
The Forest Service claims it’s fully staffed for a worsening fire season. Data shows otherwise

One of those funding sources, from an account typically used for forest research and local forestry, paid out more than federal Agriculture Department leaders said is necessary to cover the expenses. The other funding source imposes limits on the amount of spending for salaries, according to the letter.
“These significant discrepancies require clarification and accounting to Congress,” the senators wrote in the letter. Along with Heinrich, other signers included U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.) 
According to the letter, the resignations require at least $48 million this fiscal year for Forest Service employees. However, the senators are calling on the Forest Service to account for exactly how much early retirements and resignations programs cost taxpayers. 
The reduction in Forest Service employees, done at the urging of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” aimed to cut federal spending and occurred alongside widespread layoffs, including in New Mexico.

According to a spreadsheet Heinrich’s office provided to Source New Mexico, 372 Forest Service employees in New Mexico accepted the deferred resignation offer. They made up the vast majority of 500 New Mexico USDA employees who took the offer, according to the spreadsheet. 
In addition to the resignations, several dozen Forest Service employees were fired in New Mexico, though many were later re-hired. 
A spokesperson for the Forest Service did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s question about that number or a response to the senators’ letter. 
The letter gives the Forest Service until Sept. 22 to reply to nine questions about the funding and where it comes from, including why Schultz gave different answers about the funding source. It also seeks a detailed accounting of how much will be required to pay out salaries, expenses and accrued leave as of the day they stopped reporting to work.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heinrich.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Florida House photo by Meredith Geddings) Paul Renner, the Republican former Florida House speaker who has just launched a campaign for governor, lacks the backing of either President Donald Trump or Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Renner says it doesn’t matter — he still expects to win the GOP nomination by taking advantage of a deepening rift between DeSantis supporters and Trump loyalists ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race and legislative session. Renner believes he may have the “unifying” message conservative voters are looking for.
“It looks like there may be a looming civil war, and I’m going to put Florida first. That’s going to be my approach,” Renner told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. “I think the race will look very different a year from now than it does today.”
Renner, 58, referred to the growing tension between Trump and DeSantis allies as they prepare for a reignited proxy battle between the two firebrands. Trump has backed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, while DeSantis has been elevating Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
This leaves Renner to seek a third lane to the governor’s mansion, without a substantial backer.
Political analyst Susan MacManus, professor emerita at the University of South Florida, said Renner’s success depends on his ability to drive media attention, rake in money, and whether his rivals implode.
“The key is, will the other two end up destroying each other and leave an avenue for someone like him? That’s really the only real strategy that he’s got right now,” MacManus told the Phoenix. 
Renner has roughly $1 million in his political committee account, compared to Donalds’ $22 million.
Collins, who has yet to announce a bid, has around $500,000 in his committee account and a reported net worth under $2 million.
Renner plans to emphasize his alignment with Trump’s MAGA agenda while defining his record as “inseparable” from DeSantis’s legacy, which was largely built when Renner served as House Speaker. 
He played a key role in passing controversial legislation that served as a springboard for DeSantis’s 2023 presidential campaign, including a first-in-the-nation crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; expanding the death penalty to child rapists; banning transgender therapies for minors; and a stringent six-week abortion ban.
Still, DeSantis has publicly refused to endorse Renner. 
Renner isn’t fazed.
“Once voters have the year that’s ahead of us to look at all the candidates, I do believe that I’ll be successful to become the Republican nominee, and then ultimately go on to beat whoever the Democrats put up,” the Jacksonville-area attorney said.
But that will be a tall task for the gubernatorial hopeful.

‘Ego and politics and pettiness’
Renner served as House speaker from 2022 through 2024 as DeSantis flexed an iron grasp over the Legislature. The period was marked by a sweeping Republican supermajority and very little pushback from within against DeSantis, partially due to Renner. DeSantis’ priorities easily slid through the Legislature to help construct the platform from which he would launch his presidential campaign.
Renner remains in lockstep with DeSantis on top issues facing Florida, including supporting mid-decade redistricting, signing a repeal of all vaccine mandates, and slicing or eliminating property taxes, he said.
That in-sync image Republicans constructed under Renner’s two-year tenure shattered when the new House speaker, Daniel Perez, a Miami Republican, asserted the House’s independence from the executive branch. Kicking off the latest era of Republican infighting, Perez attempted to stymie DeSantis throughout the 2025 session, encouraging House investigatory committees to comb through the finances of First Lady Casey DeSantis’s Hope Florida charity while criticizing the governor as “emotional.”
It marked the first time during DeSantis’ tenure that he presided over an openly defiant GOP-led Legislature.
Renner fears these open clashes are dangerous for the Republican Party — which has more than 1 million more registered voters than Democrats — and augur a larger battle within the GOP. Reflecting on his own speakership alongside then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, Renner revealed that although they had disagreed with DeSantis at times, they always worked it out privately.
“Through intermediaries, we talked about where we had differences, we worked through those, and then we came out in public, arm in arm. That’s why we were so successful,” Renner said, declining to specify what disagreements he had with the governor.
“I’m going to always put the mission and the goal of what Floridians need ahead of ego and politics and pettiness. I have no use for it,” he added.
‘You got to deliver wins’
Renner would be the first former House Speaker to become Florida governor in recent history, signaling that while legislative leaders wield significant influence during their tenure, building broader name recognition remains a tough obstacle to achieving higher office.
Polling from the conservative Tyson Group, helmed by former DeSantis pollster Ryan Tyson, shows Donalds with a commanding lead over Renner and Collins. That distance lengthens when voters are told about Donalds’ Trump endorsement.
Donalds’ 40% to Renner’s and Collins’ 2% apiece doesn’t mean much this long before the Aug. 2026 primary, Renner, a Navy veteran, argues. Historically, candidates previously thought to be surefire winners early in the race ended up losing.
“‘Bill McCollum’s going to be your next governor. Adam Putnam’s going to be your next governor. Little Marco Rubio from the speaker’s office is at 2%, like Paul Renner is — they’re never going to make it,’” he said, mimicking political operatives and drawing comparisons between himself and Marco Rubio, a former state House speaker who now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State and National Security Adviser.
“The people that counted Marco out — and many did — are the same voices that are saying look, this guy’s got money, he’s way ahead, he’s got an endorsement. And that’s just not what voters ultimately want,” Renner continued. 
He said voters want someone with proven wins and a record of having “run something” to lead the country’s third largest state.
“Everybody can talk in bumper stickers, and do interviews, and post on social media — and I’ll certainly do some of those things. But you got to deliver some results. You got to deliver wins,” he added.
The winner of the Republican primary will face off against the Democratic nominee for the governor’s race. The only prominent Democrat in the race so far is David Jolly, a former U.S. representative.

Kelley had no information on how the suspect obtained the weapon.

Read it here.
Los comedores populares, los refugios para personas sin hogar y los centros preescolares de California pueden seguir atendiendo a quienes no tienen estatus legal, al menos temporalmente, según una decisión tomada hoy por un juez de un tribunal de distrito de Estados Unidos en Rhode Island.
En julio, cuatro departamentos federales —Educación, Justicia, Salud y Servicios Humanos, y Trabajo— ordenaron a California que rechazara a muchos inmigrantes el acceso a servicios públicos financiados con fondos federales, como la atención médica, la educación y la capacitación laboral. Las nuevas normas se aplican a ciertas categorías de inmigrantes, tanto a quienes no tienen estatus legal como a quienes lo tienen, como los solicitantes de asilo o quienes tienen visas de estudiante.
California se unió rápidamente a otros 20 estados y al Distrito de Columbia en una demanda , argumentando que los cambios en las políticas eran ilegales. El fallo, que constituye una medida cautelar, significa que el gobierno federal no puede aplicar las nuevas políticas en estos estados hasta que se resuelva la demanda, cuya resolución podría tardar meses o años.

 “Con la decisión de hoy, programas vitales de educación, nutrición y salud como Head Start, y las familias que dependen de sus servicios, pueden respirar tranquilos”, declaró Nina Sheridan, portavoz de la Fiscalía General de California. Head Start ofrece educación preescolar gratuita a niños de bajos recursos en todo el estado.
 “La Administración Trump sigue poniendo trabas a las familias californianas que solo intentan sobrevivir, pero estamos contraatacando”, dijo. “Agradecemos que un Tribunal de Distrito haya puesto fin a esta cruel nueva directiva mientras continúa nuestro litigio”.
 Los cuatro departamentos federales declararon en julio que las nuevas políticas eran un esfuerzo por cumplir con una de las órdenes ejecutivas de Trump, que afirma que los beneficios públicos fomentan la inmigración ilegal. La orden ejecutiva exige a los departamentos federales garantizar que ningún beneficio financiado por los contribuyentes se destine a extranjeros no cualificados.
 Un abogado del Departamento de Justicia, Sean Skedzielewski, dijo que las nuevas políticas también reflejan la interpretación adecuada de la ley federal, a pesar del hecho de que el Departamento de Justicia ha utilizado una interpretación diferente durante casi 30 años.
 En su decisión escrita que emitió la orden judicial preliminar, la jueza federal de distrito Mary McElroy expresó su escepticismo ante el argumento legal de Skedzielewski. «El Gobierno (federal) argumenta que, de alguna manera, ha interpretado incorrectamente este estatuto durante los casi treinta años que lleva vigente. En su opinión, todos (de todas las administraciones anteriores) lo han malinterpretado desde el principio, al menos hasta el mes pasado, cuando el Gobierno (federal) comprendió claramente la forma correcta de interpretarlo».
 McElroy escribió que las nuevas políticas, que ahora están suspendidas, significarían que “menos personas recibirán recursos críticos contra la pobreza debido a que las comunidades inmigrantes evitan los servicios, pero también porque, en general, las personas que viven en la pobreza a veces carecen de identificación gubernamental”. 
 ¿Quién califica para recibir beneficios públicos?
 En 1996, el Congreso aprobó una ley que restringía la mayoría de los beneficios públicos financiados por el gobierno federal a los ciudadanos estadounidenses o a quienes tenían ciertos estatus legales, como la tarjeta de residencia permanente. Posteriormente, al aclarar la ley, el gobierno federal estableció ciertas excepciones.
 Cualquier persona, independientemente de su estatus legal, puede acceder a un centro de atención telefónica para crisis, y cualquier menor que haya sufrido abandono o abuso puede recibir asistencia pública, ya que estos servicios son “necesarios para la protección de la vida y la seguridad”, según la guía federal de 1996 , que aclaró el significado de la ley de ese año. Los albergues para personas sin hogar y víctimas de violencia doméstica, los hospitales públicos y los programas de apoyo a la salud mental o la recuperación del consumo de sustancias también están disponibles para todos.
 Como resultado de una decisión de la Corte Suprema de 1982, el gobierno federal permite que todos los estudiantes menores de 18 años, independientemente de su estatus legal, asistan a la escuela pública. Los inmigrantes sin estatus legal también pueden acceder a Head Start e inscribirse en clases de educación para adultos, que incluyen inglés como segundo idioma y programas de equivalencia de bachillerato.
 En el condado de Santa Clara, que abarca San José, aproximadamente el 40% de los residentes son nacidos en el extranjero y más de la mitad de los niños del condado tienen un padre nacido en el extranjero. El condado recibe alrededor de 3.700 millones de dólares en fondos federales cada año, la mayor parte de los cuales financia su sistema de hospitales públicos, según una declaración judicial de Greta Hanson, directora de operaciones del condado.
 Verificar el estatus legal de los pacientes no es factible, afirmó, pero incluso si lo fuera, “tendría consecuencias extremadamente perjudiciales y disuadiría a las personas de buscar la atención que tanto necesitan”. Si una persona tiene una enfermedad contagiosa pero evita buscar atención, por ejemplo, podría poner en peligro la salud de toda su comunidad.
 Aunque las nuevas políticas entraron en vigor en julio, el sistema de salud aún no ha rechazado a ningún paciente. Los estados en la demanda y los cuatro departamentos federales acordaron retrasar la aplicación de las nuevas políticas hasta el 11 de septiembre. Debido a la orden judicial preliminar de hoy, la promulgación de las políticas tardará meses o incluso años, y si el juez finalmente falla a favor de California, es posible que nunca entren en vigor.
 Esta es solo una de las muchas demandas que California ha presentado contra la administración Trump por el trato a los inmigrantes. En un intento por implementar una orden ejecutiva presidencial diferente, que exigía a los departamentos federales detener el despilfarro, el fraude y el abuso , el Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA) solicitó a California que compartiera datos privados sobre las personas que reciben cupones de alimentos.
 En julio, fiscales generales demócratas, incluido el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, demandaron al USDA, alegando que su objetivo es atacar a las familias de estatus migratorio mixto , donde los ciudadanos estadounidenses pueden tener un familiar extranjero. California también demandó a la Administración Trump por el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional después de que las redadas federales de inmigración provocaran protestas en Los Ángeles este verano.
 En total, California ha demandado o se ha unido a otros estados para demandar al gobierno federal aproximadamente 40 veces desde la toma de posesión del presidente. Durante el primer gobierno de Trump, California demandó al presidente 123 veces y ganó aproximadamente dos tercios de esos casos.
 Muchas de las demandas presentadas este año ya han dado lugar a medidas cautelares que han detenido temporalmente las nuevas políticas de la administración Trump, pero los defensores de los inmigrantes dicen que, no obstante, las acciones del presidente han tenido un impacto.
 Muchos californianos, incluyendo aquellos con estatus legal, evitan los servicios públicos por miedo. Algunos tienen miedo incluso de salir de casa.
 En una escuela para adultos en Huntington Beach, el director Steve Curiel comentó que pocos inmigrantes asisten a clases de inglés este verano. Comentó que ha escuchado que otras escuelas del estado están observando la misma tendencia.

But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in […],"The Kentucky Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Danville this week in Newlin Hall at Centre College's Norton Center for the Arts. Centre students and students from nearby schools observed the proceedings. (Administrative Office of the Courts)Voters might have thought they settled the question of charter schools in Kentucky last year when a “school choice” amendment failed in all 120 counties.
But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in 2022.
Kentucky Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn said the charter school law does not violate the constitutional mandate to “provide for an efficient system of common schools” but would instead improve the system’s efficiency by expanding opportunities.
The charter school law “fits neatly in our tradition of common schools,” said Kuhn on behalf of Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman. “In our common school system, the status quo can never be good enough.”
Lawyers for an education advocacy group and two local school districts contended the charter school law fails several constitutional tests, including a requirement that tax-funded schools be overseen by elected boards accountable to voters.
Attorney Byron Leet, representing the Council for Better Education and the Jefferson County and Dayton Independent school boards, called the law “the latest attempt by the General Assembly to redirect public school money, public funds to schools operating outside the common school system without the approval of Kentucky’s voters as required by the Constitution.” 
The attorney general’s office is asking the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling by Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd who struck down the charter school law and enjoined its implementation in December 2023.
Shepherd wrote then that the “policy goals of the legislation are not at issue in this case” but that there “is no way to stretch the definition of ‘common schools’ so broadly that it would include such privately owned and operated schools that are exempt from the statutes and administrative regulations governing public school education.”
Kentucky Supreme Court
Defending the law, Kuhn said Shepherd in his ruling had misapplied the 1989 Supreme Court opinion in Rose v. Council for Better Education, the landmark ruling that paved the way for the Kentucky Education Reform Act.  
He said Shepherd’s ruling “treated Rose effectively as a straight jacket that prevents the legislature from meaningfully changing the common school system. Rose, however, requires the General Assembly to continually strive to improve on the status quo.” 
Also arguing in support of the charter school law was attorney Paul Salamanca, representing Gus La Fonatine who is seeking to open a charter school in Madison County under the 2022 law. 
‘Outside looking in’
In response to questions from the justices about charter schools being allowed to turn away students when their enrollment limit is reached, Salamanca said “that’s a good problem” because it’s a sign the school is filling a need. “And HB 9 (the charter school law) has a solution. You can start another school and another school. They can keep starting …  if that’s what people want.”
Both Kuhn and Salamanca told the court that 45 states have charter schools, including all the states bordering Kentucky, and praised their performance. They also likened charter schools to magnet schools in Louisville and Lexington that specialize in arts or academic rigor, saying charter schools would focus on serving at-risk youngsters who are not being well served in their current schools.
“Kentucky kids are really on the outside looking in on what has been a resounding success, especially in urban areas,” Kuhn said. “And so I really ask the court not to leave Kentucky kids on the outside looking in for this important educational development.”
Leet disputed the success of charter schools. “Let me just say there is nothing remotely resembling a consensus that charter schools are a wonderful thing. But frankly, I don’t think that’s the issue.” He said the questions before the court hinge on more than a century of legal precedent. 
A provision in the law allows school boards in districts with fewer than 7,500 students to veto charter schools. Justice Angela McCormick Bisig questioned whether the provision would create discrepancies in offerings available to students across the state.
Justice Michelle M. Keller in her questions focused on the potential harms from diverting money from existing schools into charter schools that “parents or the public at large who are actually paying the taxes have no control over. … We’re going to be paying the taxes through our property assessment tax we pay now, but we will have zero control over who administers the charter schools,” Keller said, in contrast to elected local boards who now oversee school districts. 
‘Million dollar question’
Justice Pamela Goodwine asked what she called the “million dollar question,” noting that since the charter school law was enacted and enjoined, the General Assembly had put on the ballot an amendment giving voters the opportunity to “empower the legislature to use public funds for charter schools.”
“Should that impact our decision, or should we just ignore the nearly two thirds of the voters who do not wish to have taxpayer funds used in this manner?” Goodwine asked.
Salamanca acknowledged that if voters had approved the amendment “we wouldn’t be here today.”
But he contended that charter schools as they would be governed and operated under the Kentucky law meet constitutional muster.
“The referendum asked whether the people of Kentucky supported the idea of the General Assembly appropriating money for schools outside the system of common schools. We are not outside the system of common schools.”
Goodwine drew a flutter of laughter when she said, “So did the legislature not know how to word the amendment on the ballot or were they trying to mislead the voters?”

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Curlew Hills Memory Garden in Palm Harbor on Sept. 11, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)PALM HARBOR — Speaking during a 9/11 remembrance event in Pinellas County Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis linked the tragic events of that day 24 years ago with the killing of prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, saying his fatal shooting displayed “some of the evil that’s lurking within.”
“That attack [on 9/11] was an exterior attack, with people who were emanating from foreign lands with a foreign ideology. And yesterday we saw the assassination of a young political leader, Charlie Kirk — who I knew, many of you probably knew — and you see some of the evil that’s lurking within,” DeSantis said.
He praised Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, for his ability to bring conservative viewpoints to college campuses, which he called “usually hostile terrain” for political conservatives, including himself.
The proper response to disagreeing with someone’s views is “not to shout or scream someone down. It’s not to create unrest so that the mob makes the event not happen. And it is certainly not that you kill somebody in order to silence them,” he said, as the crowd applauded.
“So, as we commemorate the lives we lost that day because of that terrorist attack, and as we recognize the evil that was present in this country as a result of this external force and this external ideology,” he continued, “let’s not now 24 years later succumb as a country to some of those forces inside our country who are really trying to upend what America is all about.”
DeSantis offered the remarks at Curlew Hills Memory Garden in Palm Harbor, a location close to where he grew up in Dunedin.
When speaking about the Al-Qaeda attacks, the governor recalled how that event changed the trajectory of his own life. If it had not occurred, he said, it was unlikely he would have become a Naval officer.
DeSantis enlisted in 2004 while in his second year at Harvard Law School and joined the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2006. He was awarded a Bronze Star for meritorious service and received at least 10 awards and decorations.
The governor gave tribute not just to the nearly 3,000 people in New York City, the Washington area, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but to the tens of thousands of first responders who sacrificed their own health that day and weeks and months later at Ground Zero in New York City.

Giving tribute to the first responders
“There’s been many that have died in the years since as a result of what they did that day and in the ensuing days,” he said.
“There’s others — first responders — who are still suffering from very significant afflictions as a result of their service on that day. So, all in, you’re looking at way more than 3,000 people as a result of that terrorist attack on 9/11. And I know we’ve got some folks that have since relocated to Florida who are battling different types of illnesses as it relates to that day and their service after, and just know this day is a day to also thank them for what they did and just express sympathy for what they’re still going through, because it’s been very difficult for a lot of people and a lot of families.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 24,000 responders who worked at the site in Lower Manhattan or at the debris-sorting pile on Staten Island have developed cancer, and more than 8,000 responders and survivors have died.
Nearly 3,800 of those who died had cancer, although the C.D.C. does not track whether cancer was the cause of death or the death was caused by 9/11-related illness.
Shortly after the event, the governor’s office announced that in response to a directive from President Trump and in honor of Charlie Kirk’s memory, the flags of the U.S. and the state of Florida will be flown at half-staff at all local and state buildings, installations and grounds throughout the state until sunset this Sunday.

“We're just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” the Department of Fish & Wildlife’s land acquisition coordinator said.

As the chestnut-sided warbler flits about the quaking aspen trees under the shadow of Birdseye Mountain in Castleton, Vermonters can hunt, fish, trap, birdwatch and trek in perpetuity along the nearly 5,000 acres of land conserved by the state, thanks to a now-completed conservation plan, state officials say. 
After eight years, the Department of Fish & Wildlife finished drafting last month its long-term plan for the land in Castleton, comprising the Birdseye and Blueberry Hill Wildlife Management Areas, according to the department’s state and private lands biologist Travis Hart. Like a quilt, Hart said, the state aims to stitch together a “patchwork” of different habitats to ensure species diversity and connectivity through permanent conservation efforts. 
The wildlife management areas situated in the Taconic Mountains bring together a unique mixture of plant and animal species and landscape features, providing a “critical link for wildlife and ecological processes across Route 4” to the Green Mountain National Forest, said John Austin, director of wildlife for the department. 
Over the next 20 years, Hart said the department plans to manage 4% of the Castleton land for ephemeral young growth forests while actively promoting the development of old growth forests on 24% of the land. The state lost much of its old growth forest during European settlement and logging for agriculture in the 1800s, and now conservationists are taking varied approaches to grow back the old growth trees, knowing their work will not come to fruition for decades if not generations.
This is one of many conservation milestones in southern Vermont in recent months, guided by Fish & Wildlife’s Vermont Conservation Design, which plans out the landscape for ecological functions, said Robert Zaino, a natural community ecologist with the department.
The areas contribute to the state’s overall conservation goal outlined in Act 59, a 2023 law that aims to permanently conserve 30% of land in Vermont by 2030, said Rebecca Washburn, director of lands administration and recreation for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
The state had already conserved 27% of land as of last year, Washburn said. Looking to fill the 3% gap in the next five years, Washburn said that departments within the Agency of Natural Resources, alongside conservation groups and land acquisition partners, are looking to invest in tracts of land that promote species connectivity, biodiversity and ecological community resilience.

Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, the main sponsor of Act 59, said the legislative intent was to ensure that the range of nine biophysical regions in the state are all addressed through different conservation models, including improving biodiversity, engaging sustainable forestry and resource management and allowing some lands to grow wild without human interference. 
For Sheldon, Act 59 — the Community Resilience and Biodiversity Protection Act — was born out of a recognition that “we need to turn the ship in order to make sure we don’t miss opportunities to conserve all of our natural communities before it’s too late.”
Through Vermont Conservation Design’s statewide mapping tool, BioFinder, Zaino said the state identifies which forest blocks serve as the highest priority “stepping stones” that help species move across the regional landscape between the Berkshires in Massachusetts, the Adirondacks in New York, the White Mountains in New Hampshire and the Gaspé Peninsula across the national border in Quebec.
Vermont’s southern region has relatively little permanently conserved land other than the federal Green Mountain National Forest, Zaino said. The state’s work with conservation partners to acquire high-priority tracts for permanent conservation is an effort to “safeguarding places that we know have this very high ecological value into the future.”

Partners acquiring land for ‘connectivity pathways’  
One such effort the state and the Conservation Fund completed this summer focused on a patchwork of land in the Chateauguay Forest. 
In June, the state was awarded $2.9 million in federal Forest Legacy Program funds to purchase and manage five parcels, said Kate Sudhoff, land conservation program manager for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
This includes nearly 900 acres on Sable Mountain in Stockbridge, which will be added to the Les Newell Wildlife Management Area, and the Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels in Reading totalling nearly 800 acres that will be added to the Calvin Coolidge State Forest. Sudhoff said the state is still working to purchase two more conservation easement parcels in Bridgewater and Killington with the federal funding.
The three plots are situated within the state’s oldest regional conservation initiative, the Chateauguay No Town Conservation Project.

Will Duane, land acquisition coordinator for Fish & Wildlife, said the Sable Mountain, Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels are higher elevation areas that lead to a menagerie of biodiversity on the landscape. The three plots are also critical “puzzle pieces” to build out protected natural areas for species movement as the state manages the land for public recreation, wildlife habitat and as a working landscape, Duane said.  
“We’re creating these connectivity pathways and these corridors for species to move back and forth, and the Sable Mountain piece is in a huge critical core habitat block in Stockbridge right there in the heart of the Green Mountains,” Duane said.  
Sally Manikian, the New Hampshire and Vermont director of The Conservation Fund, said the “organizing force” behind permanently conserved tracts of land was expanding public access to outdoor recreation along the skinny and vulnerable corridor of the Appalachian Trail connecting the Green Mountain National Forest to the White Mountains.
Another state partner, the Trust for Public Land, has also made strides toward the state’s goals, permanently conserving 500 acres at the gateway of the Robert T. Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area near the Appalachian Trail in Wallingford in March.

Shelby Semmes, the Vermont and New Hampshire state director of the trust, said the group is in the early stages of acquiring three parcels totaling over 300 acres in Dorset, which is a part of a partnership with the Vermont Huts & Trails to create a long-distance mountain biking “Velomont” trail. 
The project on the Dorset ridgeline is particularly valuable, Semmes said, because half the land is located across the Rich Northern Harwood Forest and it will conserve habitat around the northeast’s largest cave and bat hibernation site — the Dorset Bat Cave. 
In the small rural town of Jamaica, the Northeast Wilderness Trust is taking a different approach to permanent land conservation. 
In August, the trust acquired an easement on 600 acres of land for the College Hill Wilderness Sanctuary near Stratton Mountain and the Green Mountain National Forest in Windham County, which will remain permanently conserved as a “forever wild,” Northeast Wilderness Trust President Jon Leibowitz said. 
“Forever-wild conservation is a commitment that people make to a particular piece of land where we allow nature to have the freedom to evolve in a way that it directs the ebb and flow of life rather than people managing or manipulating a forest,” Leibowitz said. 
Duane said that fragmentation across the landscape makes it more difficult for species to move about, so the work of the state and conservation groups is to strategically create throughways for wildlife. 
“We’re just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” Duane said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 18:25:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Homelessness rises in CT as federal funding remains in flux,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/ct-homelessness-point-in-time-count/,"There were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in CT in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase.","A new report shows that Connecticut’s homeless population grew for the fourth year in a row from 2024 to 2025.
The state’s latest point-in-time count, which is an annual census of the homeless population, showed that there were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase, which is a smaller rate increase than last year’s report.
“The overall trend from this year’s count shows that the inflow of people into the homeless response system is more than providers of shelter and services can keep up with,” said Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.
On Thursday, the National Alliance to End Homelessness and Women’s Development Corporation filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over restrictions on federal housing grants. 
HUD’s new funding allocation rules consider whether shelters are in jurisdictions with sanctuary protections for undocumented people and whether shelters provide services around harm reduction for drug use, and they take into account policies around serving transgender people. The rules have left some providers uncertain about whether they’d get the money they need to continue operations.
The lawsuit asks for a temporary restraining order on the rules, and the organizations said in a press release that the rules are “unconstitutional and unlawful.”
Connecticut gets about $95 million annually from the federal government for homelessness and housing stability.
“It’s a very fluid situation, but these are the dollars that keep people housed year after year across the state, and they’re critical. We’re watching it, and then we’re trying to figure out the best steps forward as a state,” Fox said of the HUD policies.
Late last month, HUD ordered all public housing authorities to conduct audits to determine the legal status of their residents, and in February, HUD Secretary Scott Turner ceased enforcement of the Equal Access Rule, which required HUD-funded programs and shelters to determine eligibility based on a person’s self-identified gender.
“It’s time to get rid of all the far-left gender ideology and get government out of the way of what the Lord established from the beginning when he created man in his own image — male and female,” Turner said during the announcement. He also said there was “more to come” to ensure taxpayer dollars were being spent appropriately.
The point-in-time report shows that Connecticut has a small population of unhoused people who identified as transgender or gender nonconforming — about 20. Research shows that the LGBTQ population is more likely to experience homelessness.
Most of the increase in the homeless population came from people who are living outside, in their cars or in places not meant for human habitation. That number jumped by 45% to more than 800 people.
The largest population was adults without children, and some of the notable increases were among the older population. There was a 20% increase in people ages 55-64 and a 33% increase in those 64 and older, according to the report.
Providers have said for months that they’ve seen an increasing population of seniors who are losing their housing because of rising rents.
“There’s been a massive spike in the amount of dollars that the agencies have to put in” to house people, said Jim Bombaci, vice president of operations at Nutmeg Consulting, the agency that created the report. “Every dollar more that they put to keep a person in a unit is a dollar less they have to house a new person.”
It’s also hard for people experiencing homelessness to find a place to live because of the lack of affordable housing in Connecticut, experts said, which means that people are staying in shelters longer.
As the number of people experiencing homelessness and the lengths of stays have risen, homelessness has become a point of more political focus in the past couple of years, with lawmakers and advocates asking for more money for homelessness services in the budget and the formation of the bipartisan Homelessness Caucus.
Just over 800 people who were in some type of shelter, living outside or in a supportive housing program, in 2025 were also in the system in 2024, showing that it can be difficult for people to obtain housing and to stay housed once they find a place, Bombaci said.
“We can start to identify these people and figure out who they are, why do they keep getting recounted in the same environment from one year to the next, what interventions are failing, what interventions are working?” Bombaci said.
The report notes that even though the number of shelter beds in the state has increased, there are still not enough to meet the need.
After concerted efforts from the state’s Department of Housing and the homelessness service provider system, the number of children without a place to live has dropped significantly, according to the report.
There were about 590 children experiencing homelessness in January, compared to about 680 in 2024, according to the report.
In the past year, the Department of Housing launched a Head Start on Housing program that pairs rental aid with access to early care and education. Fox said the program had helped cut down on the number of kids without a place to live.
“I think what this reflects is when investments are made, they work,” said Jessica Kubicki, chief initiative officer at the Housing Collective in Fairfield County. “The challenge is, these investments have to be made to scale to actually what the inflow is.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0202_SR_Unhoused_115-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

Read this story in English.
El mapa de el “gancho de langosta” del 5º Distrito sobrevive en un mapa recomendado por un perito judicial, adoptado por la Corte Suprema tras el Censo de 2020.
Estados Unidos asiste a una inusual carrera de redistribución de distritos, instigada a mediados de la década por un presidente ansioso por preservar la frágil mayoría de su partido en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU., en las elecciones intermedias del próximo año.
Texas rediseñó su mapa del Congreso con el objetivo declarado de elegir a cinco Republicanos más para el Congreso el próximo año. California está respondiendo con un esfuerzo para hacer lo mismo a favor de los Demócratas. Ahora, Missouri se está uniendo al Partido Republicano.
¿Dónde terminará esto?
Bueno, no en Connecticut.
Los Demócratas controlan dos tercios de los escaños en la Asamblea General y la oficina del Gobernador, pero no pueden dibujar unilateralmente mapas más favorables ni en los distritos congresionales, ni en los legislativos estatales. E incluso si pudieran, los Demócratas ya controlan los cinco escaños del Congreso.
Un efecto secundario de que Texas le entregará al presidente Donald J. Trump un mapa del Congreso a medida es un revuelo —bueno, más bien desinformación— en redes sociales sobre si el mapa Demócrata de Connecticut es producto de la misma política agresiva que vemos en Texas, California y Missouri.
Así funciona realmente la redistribución de distritos en Connecticut, cómo la delegación del Congreso pasó de 60% Republicano a 80% Demócrata en las elecciones intermedias de 2006, y por qué algunos creen ver un “gancho de langosta” en el mapa del Congreso.
¿Es la ausencia de Republicanos de Connecticut en el Congreso una prueba de manipulación de distritos electorales?
No, aunque el mapa del Congreso actual presenta fallas, si se compara con los principios de la redistribución de distritos, como hacer que un distrito sea lo más compacto posible. Y tiene poco sentido hoy en día, a menos que se entiendan sus orígenes y cómo se elaboró.
Pero no fue una manipulación de distritos electorales Demócrata. De hecho, inicialmente favoreció a los Republicanos.
La base del mapa actual son los cambios radicales impuestos por el Censo del 2000, cuando Connecticut perdió uno de sus seis escaños en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU. Desde entonces, solo ha sufrido ligeros ajustes tras los resultados de los censos de 2010 y 2020.
El Demócrata James Maloney de Danbury, quien representó al 5.º Distrito, y la Republicana Nancy Johnson de New Britain, quien representó al 6.º Distrito, que pronto desaparecería, terminaron en el mismo distrito en 2002.
El nuevo 5º Distrito se diseñó no tanto para servir a los intereses de los votantes sino a los de Maloney y Johnson. El objetivo era establecer una competencia justa, lo que requirió vaciar el otrora compacto 1er Distrito del Gran Hartford.
Johnson ganó en 2002. De hecho, los Republicanos ganaron tres de los cinco escaños en 2002 y 2004. Los Demócratas dieron la vuelta en el 5º y el 2º distrito en 2006, aprovechando la impopularidad de George W. Bush y la guerra en Irak.
Completaron la victoria en 2008, conquistando el 4º distrito en el condado de Fairfield, gracias al éxito de Barack Obama.
Johnson y Maloney hace tiempo que se alejaron de la política activa. La incómoda frontera entre el 1º y el 5º distrito —el gancho de langosta— persiste.
¿Por qué rara vez se dibujan los mapas del Congreso a mediados de la década?
El impulso suele ser igualar la población de los distritos congresionales tras la finalización de un censo en un decenio, y no reaccionar ante la posibilidad de que un partido pierda la Cámara de Representantes en las próximas elecciones.
Asignar escaños en el Congreso según la población es un juego de suma cero. El número de escaños en la Cámara de Representantes se mantiene constante en 435, y los tribunales han dictaminado que cada distrito debe tener aproximadamente la misma población, en la medida de lo posible.
Esto significa que el mayor crecimiento poblacional en los Estados del Sur y del Oeste desplazó el poder político. El Censo del 2000 dio como resultado que Arizona, Florida, Georgia y Texas obtuvieran dos escaños en la Cámara, y California, Colorado, Nevada y Carolina del Norte, uno.
Nueva York y Pensilvania perdieron dos. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Misisipi, Ohio, Oklahoma y Wisconsin perdieron uno.
¿Quién dibuja los mapas en Connecticut?
En algunos Estados, obtener el control de la legislatura significa que un partido se encarga de dibujar el mapa. No es así en Connecticut. La constitución estatal asigna la tarea a un comité legislativo de ocho personas con igual número de Republicanos y Demócratas en la Cámara y el Senado.
Si no llegan a un acuerdo sobre un mapa, los legisladores deben elegir a ocho miembros para una nueva comisión de redistribución de distritos. Esos ocho miembros deben entonces ponerse de acuerdo para elegir a un noveno miembro. Si esto no genera consenso, la tarea de trazar nuevos distritos recae en la Corte Suprema del Estado.
Cada 10 años, los legisladores tienen pocos problemas para negociar nuevos distritos legislativos estatales. Sin embargo, se han estancado en la realización de cambios al mapa del Congreso.
Como resultado, la revisión del mapa del Congreso después de los censos de 2010 y 2020 se delegó en la Corte Suprema y un perito judicial designado por el tribunal, quienes solo han realizado los cambios mínimos necesarios para igualar la población de los cinco distritos.
Justificación del tribunal: El mapa elaborado tras el Censo del 2000 fue imparcial, y corresponde a la Asamblea General realizar cambios más significativos.
Por cierto, el software cartográfico ha facilitado considerablemente el trazado de nuevos distritos.

Si no son los mapas, ¿cómo se explican los resultados desiguales que favorecen a los Demócratas?
La respuesta son las cifras y las tendencias.
Primero, las cifras. Solo el 21 % de los votantes registrados son Republicanos, en comparación con el 36 % de Demócratas y el 42 % de no afiliados. Los suburbios adinerados que en un día fueron la base del Partido Republicano, especialmente en el condado de Fairfield, se han inclinado hacia el Partido Demócrata, al igual que algunos suburbios obreros se han inclinado hacia el Partido Republicano.
Esta tendencia se aceleró desde la elección de Trump.
Los Republicanos cayeron a su mínimo histórico en 2008, cuando la popularidad de Obama ayudó a los Demócratas a obtener mayorías de 114-37 en la Cámara de Representantes Estatal y de 24-12 en el Senado Estatal. El Partido Republicano fue ganando terreno de forma constante, quedándose a las puertas de la mayoría en la Cámara y ganando un empate de 18-18 en el Senado.
De hecho, al Partido Republicano le fue bien con Trump encabezando la votación en 2016, a pesar de que perdió estrepitosamente en el Estado: los Republicanos ganaron un empate de 18-18 en el Senado Estatal y se quedaron a cuatro escaños de la mayoría en la Cámara.
Pero todas las elecciones desde la victoria de Trump han sido un problema para los Republicanos. El mismo mapa legislativo que casi produjo la paridad en 2016 dio a los Demócratas amplias mayorías en 2018 y 2020.
La tendencia continuó con la versión elaborada tras el Censo de 2020.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-3.13.55-PM-1-1024x793.png,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

Currently, the state’s minimum wage is $14.65, but the Maine Department of Labor announced Thursday the 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The “tip wage,” or the minimum wage for service employees, will increase to $7.55 per hour. 
This is a slightly smaller jump than the 50 cent increase the state saw between 2024 and 2025. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, there was a 3.1% increase in the cost-of-living index between August 2024 and last month. 
For the first time, the state’s minimum wage will pertain to agricultural workers since Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in June that now guarantees them the right.
An estimated 35,000 workers in Maine were paid hourly and received less than $15 an hour in 2024, according to the Current Population Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The cities of Portland and Rockland have their own minimum wages, which are typically higher than the state’s. Both cities usually update their minimum wage based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, so their rate for 2025 is $15.50.
However, Portland City Council voted last month to place a question on the November ballot asking residents if they’d like to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years. If approved, the rate would jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027, and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday unanimously voted to consider an Advisory Opinion Request from a state lawmaker concerning candidate bank accounts. 
In a written request from Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, dated Sept. 9, the lawmaker asked the Commission to clarify a rule regarding bank accounts for candidate contribution holdings. The current rule, as he said he understands it, requires a candidate or officeholder to close their current bank account, open a new one and transfer carry-over funds with each new election cycle, even when running for reelection of the same office. 
“I have found the action to be cumbersome, be confusing, and possibly lead to the unintended consequence of observers being misled by the transfer of funds,” Strom wrote. 
The commission is expected to hear public feedback on a preliminary, written opinion at its Nov. 13 meeting. A draft of the opinion must be issued at least five days prior to the public hearing. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said several lawmakers have pointed to this rule as a point of confusion. 
Many officeholders seek reelection and run for office multiple election cycles in a row, she said. The question is can candidates have one bank account stay open, rather than open a new account and transfer campaign funds every election cycle, Bruce Boone said. 
“We definitely want to keep things transparent and accountable, but we also don’t want to miss the forest for the trees and make things so difficult, either,” she said.

(Courtesy of NMILC) On Sept. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a ban on federal immigration agents’ racial profiling practices of Spanish-speaking workers in Southern California. The decision prompted swift rebuke from New Mexico’s congressional delegation and Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who noted in a statement that the New Mexico Constitution protects people from “racial profiling by state, county and municipal law enforcement.” A few days later, Source New Mexico sat down with Zoe Bowman, the managing attorney of the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s asylum and detention team, to talk about the recent decision and other issues facing immigrants in the state.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: How do you anticipate the SCOTUS ruling on racial profiling will impact New Mexico? 
Bowman: The ruling allows [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to use factors like the color of someone’s skin, the language they’re speaking, their accent, where they are working or just where they are in the community as a reason to arrest or to detain someone. It really emboldens ICE to be able to arrest and detain a lot more people.
We appreciate when our elected officials [take] a stance against collaboration with ICE, especially in cases where it’s unlawful under the New Mexico Constitution.
A new report from the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Sept. 8 recommended DHS close all three of the state’s detention centers. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham left immigration detention off of the special session agenda, saying lawmakers wanted more time in the interim to address it in the January 2026 session. What’s your response?
We recognize this is an urgent issue, but we’re ready to move forward in January [and support] the Immigrant Safety Act [which passed the state Legislature’s House of Representatives in the most recent session].
We know that more and more New Mexico residents are being caught up in the web of ICE enforcement and detention. This issue is only getting more urgent, more important, as ICE continues to threaten the safety and well being of New Mexico communities. That pressure is going to translate for lawmakers in New Mexico and in the upcoming legislative session in January, and we’re feeling hopeful we can pass it this year.
What does NMILC consider an emerging threat in immigration and detention in New Mexico?
New Mexico has a majority of people of color. This Supreme Court decision not only threatens the rights and the safety of people who are undocumented, but is really expansive and opens up more people to ICE enforcement actions. We’re very concerned about that and believe that justice shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the language that you speak.
This decision weakens a core constitutional protection in the Fourth Amendment, that protects everyone from unreasonable searches and detentions. It weakens protection, not just for folks who are undocumented, but for all of us.

Raphael Warnock, pictured at a May town hall, is proposing a system of commissary coupons to help junior enlisted servicemembers access healthy meals more easily as part of Congress' annual defense bill. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderService members could have easier access to healthy meals under a bipartisan proposal introduced Thursday by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock.
The Commissary Healthy Options and servicemember Wellness Act – or the CHOW Act – introduced by Warnock and Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, creates a limited year-long pilot program to give junior enlisted servicemembers a monthly credit to use at on-base commissaries. The senators are hoping to incorporate it into the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which is expected to make its way through the Senate next week.
“For too long, service members have not had their dollars stretch far enough, and have lacked access to good, quality, nutritious food, which is basic,” Warnock said in a phone interview. “Our service members are the best among us. They shouldn’t be struggling with anything that resembles food insecurity. We need them to be ready and healthy and not have to resort to unhealthy alternatives.”
As proposed, the amendment directs the Department of Defense to administer the program starting at two bases, to be selected by the department. The bill instructs the department to choose the bases based on factors including low satisfaction with dining halls, large numbers of enlisted members living in barracks with access to kitchens and commissaries that are “experimenting with or expanding their selection of nutritious and minimally processed ready-made and easy-to-make food options.”
The amount of the coupons and other details will also be managed by the DOD.
Warnock said he’s hopeful the pilot will be a success and Congress will expand the program nationwide.
The effort comes after Warnock led an inquiry into the military’s spending on food and nutrition quality.
Commissaries are grocery stores on military installations that offer fresh food and packaged meals at a discount to service members and their families. Often, whether for convenience or cost, service members turn to fast food or snacks instead of more wholesome meals.
“Very often their allowance doesn’t go far enough,” Warnock said. “And let’s face it, we’re all witnessing this with the inflation that we are seeing, things cost more. Service members don’t live in a world that’s detached from the world that the rest of us live in. They live in that same world.”
A 2023 report by the American Security Project, a military think tank, found that about 70% of all active-duty service members are overweight, and 21% are obese, according to the Military Times.
Warnock said he hopes the new food benefit will boost morale and help increase readiness by ensuring troops are healthy and fit.
“How you eat impacts how you feel,” he said. “All of us have had those days – maybe not for lack of resources, it could simply be that you’re busy – when you’re not eating well, you’re just dragging through the day, and it’s because your nutrition is out of order. And we can ill afford to have that be the case for our service members.”
The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the defense bill Wednesday with only 17 Democrats voting for it.

John Diehl, a former speaker of the Missouri House who was forced to resign in disgrace in 2015 when it was revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate text messages to an intern, pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal wire fraud charge. 
Diehl, a Republican from Town and Country, was released on his own recognizance Thursday pending a Dec. 19 sentencing hearing.
Federal prosecutors say Diehl admitted to applying for a loan through a federal program designed to help struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and using the money to make payments on a Tesla, an Audi and a Jeep, along with pool maintenance, country-club dues, mortgage bills and college tuition for a family member. 
All total, Diehl admitted to defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration out of $379,900.
Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine or both.  Diehl’s attorney said Thursday that his client has repaid the loan proceeds to the United States Treasury.
Diehl was arguably the state’s most powerful politician in 2015 when the Kansas City Star revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate messages to a 19-year-old House intern. While he initially refused to step down, he eventually resigned when it became clear he’d lost the support of key members of his party.
After his political career ended, he laid low for years before reemerging in 2018 to advocate for a company he co-owned that was hoping to mine cobalt in the Bootheel.
He later became embroiled in controversy in Independence, when the FBI began scrutinizing a contract to demolish the power plant in Missouri City owned by Independence Power & Light. Diehl was attorney for the company that won the contract despite bidding twice as much as the other company seeking the job.
A federal grand jury issued subpoenas to Independence to obtain a number of records related to the two utility deals, including minutes to private meetings held by the Independence City Council where the transactions were discussed. Additionally, numerous city officials were interviewed by federal law enforcement.
A Kansas City businessman named Joseph Campbell who was connected to the utility contract testified under oath that the FBI questioned him about Diehl, whom he accused of trying to create a fake attorney-client relationship in order to keep from having to hand over certain documents the government had requested through a subpoena.
Through an attorney, Diehl denied the accusation at the time. No criminal charges have been filed in connection to the Independence contracts.
In 2023, Diehl was fined $47,000 by the Missouri Ethics Commission for allegedly misusing campaign funds.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diehl-and-gavel-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-11 17:56:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"‘A really good guess’: Jackson city officials, lacking confidence in the numbers, pass $337 million budget",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/11/a-really-good-guess-jackson-city-officials-lacking-confidence-in-the-numbers-pass-337-million-budget/,Jackson officials passed a level budget Wednesday while expressing uncertainty in the financial figures due to the city’s failure to maintain annual audits — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute.,"A half hour into Jackson’s final budget meeting Wednesday, Councilmember Vernon Hartley wanted to know if — out of the hundreds of millions of dollars the city council was poised to pass in the annual budget — the city could allocate $2.5 million to blight control equipment. 
Pieter Teeuwissen, the chief administrative officer, leaned down from the dais to speak with one of his employees before offering a counter: That would work if Hartley dropped the number by a million. 
“No sir,” Hartley said.
Then Teeuwissen explained his hesitation: Like many officials in the council chambers, he lacked confidence in the accuracy of the city’s proposed budget book. 
“All this is numbers that none of us are willing to build our own financial houses on,” he said. “So I don’t want you allocating money beyond what my finance people say they are comfortable with.”
The uncertainty stems from the city’s failure to keep up with its audited financial statements — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute. This concern led Mayor John Horhn’s administration to recommend the Jackson City Council adopt a generally flat budget this year. 
On Wednesday, the council passed the roughly $337 million budget, up from $325 million last year, Teeuwissen said, a difference that is due to the infusion of one-time funds, not substantial growth in the city’s general fund.

Hartley ended up dropping his proposal by a million as Teeuwissen asked. Other changes the council made to Horhn’s proposed budget included amendments from Councilman Kenneth Stokes to give a discretionary raise for the lowest-paid city employees and add an additional $1 million to the police and fire departments after the city completes the back-due audits. One proposal that failed would have forced the administration to pay the zoo’s water bills.
“We need to show some money in this budget that’s just not fluff, not just some money in the sky that ain’t there,” Stokes said. 
Council President Brian Grizzell said after the meeting that due to the late audits, the council does not know how much money the city has in its fund balance. He described his level of confidence in the budget he had just passed as “moderate” and added he hoped to have more time to look at the numbers next year. 
“We haven’t passed an audit since I’ve been in office,” Grizzell said. “It’s always just been a really good guess.” 
To remedy that, Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today the mayor also hopes to consolidate some of the city’s 11 departments starting Oct. 1, when the new budget takes effect. 
The administration said the mergers, which will include reducing the number of city employees, will help in the event that the budget changes once the city’s audited financial statements are complete. 
“The main thing Jacksonians need to know is that — I’m trying to choose my words carefully — the city, the administration has proposed to the council a flat budget in light of the lack of audited financial data,” Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today. “It is also likely that the city budget will have to decrease during the fiscal year as audited numbers are received now.” 
To complicate matters, the audited financial statements will not answer every question facing the city’s budget, Teeuwissen said.
Take, for instance, longrunning concerns about the impact Jackson’s dwindling population will have on its tax base. Officials do not know the extent to which Jackson is missing out on revenue due to potentially low property tax collection rates, even as the city property tax revenues grew by $2 million to $68 million this year, according to Fidelis Malembeka, the chief financial officer. 
“You might lose population, but somebody’s property values still increase,” Malembeka said after the meeting. 
Overall, the city’s revenues fell by about $8 million from last year to $316 million, Malembeka said, mainly due to a decline in one-time funding. Revenue generally includes permits and fees, sales tax, grants and non-recurring funding such as the Siemens settlement.
If the administration truly lacked confidence in the city’s budget figures, they would have taken more drastic action than proposing a level budget, said Tina Clay, a council member who represents northwest Jackson.
“If that was the case you need to freeze everything until you get the audit,” she told Mississippi Today.

Teeuwissen said the administration will be focusing on sensibly organizing city government, such as reinstituting monthly meetings with department-level fiscal officers, reviewing the finance department’s recordkeeping methods and moving services so they fall within the same department. 
“Right now, we do grass-cutting by contract, grass-cutting by community improvement and grass-cutting by Parks and Rec, and we’re supposed to have right-of-way maintenance by Public Works,” he said. “Three different departments and contractors all supposedly doing some version of the same thing but we really don’t have the left hand knowing what the right hand is doing.” 
The council on Tuesday passed a resolution supporting the mayor’s goal of consolidating and merging departments. Another way the city is attempting to coordinate efforts around infrastructure projects is an agreement approved Tuesday to share resources between the city and county, Clarion Ledger reported.
Parkinson told Mississippi Today he was relieved to know that the budget is not the end-all, be-all of the city’s spending power, as it can receive more revenue throughout the year in one-time payments, such as a $1 million grant the council accepted Tuesday from Jackson State University for beautification.

“I think there’s many people, myself being one of them, that says as much as we want to re-examine everything from the ground up, I don’t know if we can start with a blank sheet of paper in a couple of months and meet the deadline that we have legally,” Parkinson said. 
The city’s budget needed to be finalized before Sept. 15. Over the past week, council members heard budget requests from individual city departments. Some of the needs included helping the community improvement division tackle blight, such as streetlights that are out across the city, improving police technology and purchasing new patrol vehicles, and reopening the Sykes Community Center. 
But moves like that depend on coordination across the system — which, an exchange toward the end of the council meeting illustrated, is lacking in Jackson. 
In an effort to help the legal department, which was considering moving buildings due to HVAC issues, Foote proposed the city put an additional $1 million into the fund for the care and maintenance of public buildings. 
Then Foote learned from Sharon Thames, the deputy chief financial officer, that Jackson already has $710,000 for HVAC repairs set aside in a different fund, one that’s for the “repair and replacement” of city infrastructure. 
Thames explained the monies weren’t listed in the budget book where Foote had looked.
“I mean, this is crazy, people are packing up and getting ready to move when we have money in our budget,” Foote responded. “We’re not communicating well across the system if the money is there, and then we’re being told by the legal department they have to move out because the money to fix their HVAC isn’t there?”
“I mean, to kind of answer your question on the legal (department), that building belongs to JRA (Jackson Redevelopment Authority), not to the city of Jackson,” Thames said. 
“JRA belongs to the city of Jackson,” Foote shot back. Clay shook her head and other council members laughed. 
“Well, yeah, but they don’t like to share their money,” Thames quipped.
(JRA Director Christopher Pike told Mississippi Today Thursday that his agency, a partner to the city, deploys its funding on programming and building maintenance — it’s not as much a matter of not sharing as it is having limited resources — and that it stands ready to assist with these concerns).
Teeuwissen chimed in. 
“As a practical matter I’m with you,” he said to Foote. “If that money was available, that should have been clear so y’all could decide how to address the problem or how to proceed.”

SC State has not received any direct threats, spokesman Sam Watson said, but the school has heightened security as a precaution. Security personnel stationed at campus entrances are checking photo IDs of students, employees and visitors before allowing people to enter.
Watson called this “standard operating procedure” for the school any time there is a potential safety risk.
The school is instructing students and staff to report any suspicious activity to the campus Public Safety office at 803-536-7188.
In other states, some schools are locking down their campuses and cancelling classes in response to threats.
Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana went on lockdown Thursday morning, citing “a potential threat to campus safety,” according to the Louisiana Illuminator, a States Newsroom affiliate. The school asked members of the public not to enter campus until further notice.
Lockdowns also have been confirmed at other HBCUs including:

Alabama State University, which told USA TODAY it had received “terrorist threats”
Clark Atlanta University
Bethune-Cookman University, in Daytona Beach, Florida
Hampton State University, in Virginia
Spelman College, in Atlanta

,DC,2025-09-11 17:48:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump Education Department to divert grants from colleges serving students of color,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-education-department-divert-grants-colleges-serving-students-color,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced it will withhold $350 million of congressionally approved funds to minority-serving colleges and universities and divert the funds elsewhere, saying that the institutions’ admissions quotas are discriminatory.  The move eliminated fiscal 2025 discretionary funding for institutions that serve students who are Asian, Black, Indigenous and Hispanic, as well as a program for students of color pursuing careers in science and engineering. It’s consistent with President Donald Trump’s longstanding objective to eliminate programs that center on diversity, equity and inclusion.“To further our commitment to ending discrimination in all forms across federally supported programs, the Department will no longer award Minority-Serving Institution grants that discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.McMahon cited a July opinion from the U.S. Justice Department that it was unconstitutional for federal funds to go to Hispanic-serving institutions based on the student body makeup.That opinion reversed a decades-long record of the federal government setting aside funding for higher education institutions that have a significant portion of students from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. The schools affected by Wednesday’s announcement are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; Black institutions; Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions; Native American-serving nontribal institutions; and institutions receiving Minority Science and Engineering Improvement grants. The announcement was vague about where the money would go instead, saying only it would be diverted “into programs that do not include discriminatory racial and ethnic quotas and that advance Administration priorities.”Up to 800 schools affectedDemocrats swiftly condemned the move, which is likely to face legal challenges.Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking member on the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee, said in a statement that the move undercut efforts to help students of color reach financial stability.“These institutions are effective engines of economic mobility because they meet students where they are and are dedicated to educating the whole person,” Scott said in a statement.Roughly 5 million students are enrolled in the more than 800 minority-serving institutions across the country. The schools aim to help students of color and students from low-income backgrounds pursue higher education. Most of the minority-serving schools receive funding based on racial quotas, except for Black institutions and tribal colleges, whose designations are based on their historical missions to educate Black or Native American students.The Department of Education will also reprogram funds from a program to develop Hispanic-serving institutions and from a program promoting postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans.McMahon argued that because most minority-serving institutions require that a percentage of the student body reflect the racial background the institutions serve, it violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protections. Administration cites equal protectionsMcMahon pointed to the Justice Department’s July memo saying it would not defend a suit brought by the state of Tennessee against Hispanic-serving institutions. The Supreme Court has explained that ‘[o]utright racial balancing’ is ‘patently unconstitutional,’” U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson. “And its precedents make clear that the government lacks any legitimate interest in differentiating among universities based on whether ‘a specified number of seats in each class’ are occupied by ‘individuals from the preferred ethnic groups,’” Sauer wrote.The U.S. Supreme Court case that Sauer cited in his letter to Johnson is the 2023 decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions that found two prominent universities’ consideration of race in acceptances violated the U.S. Constitution.Most minority-serving institutions, about 70%, are Hispanic-serving institutions, according to Rutgers University’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions.David Mendez, the head of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, an advocacy group, said in a statement that the loss in funding is “an attack on equity in higher education.”“Cutting this funding strips away critical investments in under-resourced and first-generation students and will destabilize colleges in 29 states,” Mendez said. “The funds granted to HSIs have never supported only Latino students. These funds strengthen entire campuses, creating opportunities and resources that benefit all students, especially those pursuing (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, as well as enhancing the communities where these colleges and universities are located.”",,,,2025-09-11 13:58:05.375406

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy overcharged state agencies by $2 million on 2024 energy bills — more than double initial estimates —  according to a new state audit published on Sept. 5. 
The 13-page report by Andrew Manca, chief of internal audits with the Rhode Island Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity comes as state utility regulators deepen their own review of potentially more widespread billing errors by Rhode Island Energy.
“At this point, one of my concerns is that we don’t fully understand what the problem was, or how many people it affects,” Todd Bianco, chief economic and policy analyst for the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC), said in an interview Thursday. 
Flooded by customer complaints alleging artificially high winter energy bills, including from state government administrators, the PUC in May ordered Rhode Island Energy to  hire a consultant to probe for evidence of billing inaccuracies. Last week, the PUC authorized a contract with Virginia-based professional services firm Guidehouse, Inc.  — one of three firms to respond to Rhode Island Energy’s request for proposals. An initial kickoff meeting between parties was held Wednesday, Bianco said.
The cost of the Guidehouse contract has not been made public.
Under state regulators’ directives, Guidehouse has until Nov. 15 to report results of its own audit into Rhode Island Energy’s billing practices. Manca’s report, which exclusively covers the 2,250 Rhode Island Energy electric and gas accounts held by the state government, will be incorporated into Guidehouse’s review of other commercial and residential customers.
And if the state review is any indicator, the problem may be more pervasive than anticipated. In July, state auditors identified overcharges of roughly $1 million. The deeper dive revealed state agencies were actually overbilled by over $2 million, according to the audit report.
The primary cause identified by the state was the transition from a legacy billing system inherited when PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, bought the state’s electric and gas operations from National Grid in 2022. 
During the transition to a new billing software, bills from August through October 2024 failed to credit the state for excess renewable electricity it generated. Under the typical net metering bill practice, customers with solar panels, wind turbines or other renewable energy systems receive future bill credits for any energy they produce beyond what they personally use, and return to the electric grid. 
Overcharges to Rhode Island state government have been mostly rectified, with the state using the credits toward its regular, monthly bills.  Payments on gas and electric bills resumed in June and August, respectively, according to Manca’s report.
A single state gas account remains outstanding, having not been identified for overcharges in the data initially provided by Rhode Island Energy, Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, confirmed via email Thursday.
‘Most unique customer’
Rhode Island Energy did not dispute the findings.
“Rhode Island Energy has been transparent and cooperative throughout the State’s audit process,” Michael Dalo, a spokesperson, said in a statement Thursday. “The State of Rhode Island is our largest and most unique customer, with over 2,000 bills from separate state entities consolidated into one. The timing issues identified through this audit were primarily the result of system changes during our transition from National Grid’s legacy platforms. We have addressed these issues, implemented corrective actions, and continue to strengthen our billing systems and processes. We remain committed to accuracy, accountability, and working closely with state partners to ensure reliable service.”
But the state audit doesn’t offer much reassurance that future errors won’t occur, or will be easily detected if they do. Manca highlighted the lack of automation and account mislabeling as systemic problems.
“The State of Rhode Island bears the burden of ensuring billing accuracy,” he concluded. These manual corrections introduce inefficiencies, increase administrative workload, and increase the potential for errors during invoicing.”
Bianco acknowledged that the state is a more complex customer than a typical household or business, with multiple buildings and accounts, along with separate, third-party suppliers for some of its energy. He was unsure whether the problems identified were isolated to the state, to large commercial accounts, or perhaps to net metering customers.
“There’s concern that the billing system did not perform, and other customers might have been impacted,” Bianco said.

The renewable energy wind project Revolution Wind was 80% complete when Trump halted its construction. 
On August 22, 2025, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order, citing national security concerns, although it did not identify any legal violation or threat to safety. At the time, all offshore foundations had been completed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines were installed.
The project began construction in Rhode Island in 2023 and was expected to start commercial operations next year, delivering enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in New England, according to Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection.
A DEEP preliminary analysis estimates a loss of the project could increase the cost of electricity for businesses and residents across New England by 5% to 7%.
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the development companies have sued the Trump administration over the wind farm stop-work order.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).Wisconsin leaders condemned political violence and said they are continuing to discuss security in the Capitol on Thursday following the assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.
Kirk, a conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed Wednesday while speaking at a university event in Orem, Utah. The search is still underway for the shooter.
During a floor session Thursday, the Wisconsin State Assembly held a moment of silence for Kirk as well as one to honor the 24th anniversary of 9/11.
“Mr. Kirk’s family are in our thoughts today,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. “We are still sad about the assassination of Representative Melissa Horton in Minnesota. Political violence and violence is never the answer — whether it’s the arson attack on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home, the attempt on President Trump’s life or the university and college shootings that are happening all across our nation. Violence is never the answer.”
Hesselbein also acknowledged the shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado that happened Wednesday afternoon.
“This was another senseless act of political violence unfortunately against Charlie Kirk, and I want to express my deepest condolences to his loved ones,” Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said. “We all condemn political violence in the strongest possible terms. No one should fear for their lives because of their jobs.”
Security and safety concerns have been at the forefront of lawmakers’ minds this year, especially after the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The names of several Wisconsin politicians were found on a list of targets belonging to the Minnesota shooting suspect.
“Given the recent rise in political violence, of course, this is top of mind for many of our colleagues, and of course, the staff who work in the Capitol as well as the press, the guests, the children that come through this building on Capitol visits,” Neubauer said. “It’s an ongoing conversation, and we hope to continue that with our Republican colleagues, who of course control the safety in our chambers, as well as the other entities in the Capitol.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he is “very confident” in the Capitol police force and noted that many of the incidents that have occurred were not located in Capitol buildings. 
“When you look at Minnesota, it was in their homes. If you look at what happened yesterday to Charlie Kirk, it was in a public venue on campus, so the idea that we’re somehow going to fortify a single building to make people feel safer when the reality is that most of the violence that has occurred has not been inside of the buildings, but outside of people’s home.
In a video Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump condemned the assassination and listed acts of violence that have occurred against right-leaning figures, including the attempt on his own life last year, but neglected to mention the murder of the Hortmans. He blamed the incidents on “radical left political violence.” 
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” Trump said. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence.”
Asked about Trump only recognizing violence against conservatives, Vos said he didn’t see the comments. But Vos said he knows that in Trump’s “heart” he believes that “assassination is 100% of the time wrong.”
“When Melissa Hortman, who was clearly a liberal Democrat, I didn’t hear anybody on the right celebrating the fact that she was assassinated. It was awful, and that’s what it should be,” Vos said, adding that he condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death.
During the moment of silence, Vos said Kirk was a man “who represented free speech” and “was silenced in the most horrific way possible.” He said that the country is “rapidly deteriorating” as “many see the other party as their mortal enemies out to destroy the country, not just good-hearted political rivals that we should be.”
Wisconsin’s congressional delegation and other state leaders also condemned political violence on Wednesday, though one Republican has taken the route of blaming others for the violence. 
Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said that “there is no two ways about this: political violence has no place in America. I am keeping Charlie and his family in my thoughts in this truly horrifying moment.”
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied called Kirk “a true American Patriot” and said “his legacy will live on for generations to come.” 
“There is absolutely zero place for political violence in our country,” Wied said. 
“Violence against anyone because of their political beliefs is wrong. Violence against others is wrong.  Violence is never the answer for resolving our differences or disagreements,” Gov. Tony Evers said. “Wisconsin joins in praying for Charlie Kirk and the Utah Valley community and first responders.”
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, has been posting consistently since news broke about the assassination, blaming reporters and Democrats for the violence. 
“The left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. And they want it,” Van Orden wrote in one post. In another, he said reporters and Democrats were “directly culpable.” 
Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker said in a statement that Van Orden was encouraging violence. 
“His terrifying statements, which are inviting civil war and encouraging violence against Democrats and the media, are being completely ignored by Republicans in Wisconsin and in D.C.. They have a responsibility to tell Derrick Van Orden to stop pouring gasoline on an open flame, and I implore them to do so immediately,” Remiker said.
Remiker had already condemned the violence in a statement Wednesday, saying, “this sort of violence will continue until all of us, regardless of party, condemn these sorts of heinous actions.”

(Justin Haag/Nebraskaland Magazine, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN – John Ricks, the state tourism director who deployed the edgy and controversial marketing pitch “Nebraska. Honestly, it’s not for everyone,” has resigned.
Ricks, who was paid $133,838-a-year, could not immediately be reached for comment. His resignation was accepted Thursday by the State Tourism Commission, which has since appointed Deputy Director Heather Hogue as interim executive director, as was reported first by the Nebraska Rural Radio Network.
While Ricks got mixed reviews on the tourism pitch, an official with the Nebraska Travel Association said he played a key role in helping increase tourism in the state, citing a 26.4% growth rate in state lodging taxes from 2019-2022 compared to only 2.5% nationally.

“Ricks is to be commended for putting Nebraska on the tourism map,” said Kerri Rempp, president of the state travel association.
Hired in 2016 by then Gov. Pete Ricketts, Ricks had worked as an associate director in Colorado’s state tourism office before taking the Nebraska job. His hiring was touted as bringing a fresh perspective to a state that had been rated by one group as the “least likely” for tourists to visit.
That led to the new “Nebraska: Honestly, it’s not for everyone” marketing pitch, which included advertising emphasizing off-beat adventures in Nebraska, from floating down a river in a horse tank to hop-scotching across Badlands-like formations in Toadstool Park.
The self-deprecating pitch grabbed national attention, and, in 2022, won a national award for best integrated marketing and messaging. According to the State Tourism Commission, it also raised Nebraska’s tourism profile from last to 45th.
But some state leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen and then Nebraska Department of Economic Development Director Tony Goins, disliked the motto, which was coined by a marketing firm from Colorado. Goins said it “made a mockery” of the DED’s pitchline for new residents: “The Good Life is Calling.”
By 2024, the “not for everyone” tagline was dropped by the Tourism Commission and state legislators passed a bill seeking to better coordinate marketing pitches between the independent commission, also known as “Visit Nebraska” and state economic development officials.
The Nebraska Travel Association, in a press release this week, urged the State Tourism Commission to “act swiftly” to replace Ricks.
The tourism agency is funded by lodging taxes paid on motel and hotel bills. Its budget this year is $10.1 million to promote an industry that generates $4.5 billion in spending annually and supports over 41,000 jobs throughout Nebraska.

Jim Lucas visited the White House on Aug. 26, taking this selfie with a portrait of President Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally after an attempted assassination on the campaign trail. (Photo from Lucas' Facebook)One of Indiana’s first Republican lawmakers to declare opposition to mid-cycle redistricting is “now a rock solid HELL YES.”
Seymour Rep. Jim Lucas announced his reversal on Facebook and X just two weeks after he and his colleagues met with President Donald Trump’s administration on redistricting — and within hours of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Rep. Heath VanNatter, R-Kokomo. (From Indiana House Republicans)
Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
Lucas’ endorsement prompted criticism from Kokomo Rep. Heath VanNatter, a fellow member of the Indiana House’s GOP caucus.
“I knew you would fold,” VanNatter wrote. “Maybe you should keep your powder dry next time.”
Lucas replied that he “made a damn good case” against redistricting and “stand(s) by” his position at the time. He previously called the idea “highly unusual and politically optically horrible,” and pushed for electoral wins “the old-fashioned way.”
But after the D.C. trip and Kirk’s death, Lucas explained, “I have ZERO problem to publicly come out and explain my changed position.”
VanNatter responded by quoting Lucas’ own words — “hard no” and “dangerous precedent” — back at him, adding, “I assumed that meant that you opposed (mid-cycle redistricting) but I guess I don’t know what those words mean.”
He mocked Lucas’ phrasing and called the change “a real weird and quick flip flop.”
VanNatter hasn’t made his own position explicit, however.
Lucas didn’t respond. Instead, on Thursday morning, he posted a lengthy explanation of his reasoning to Facebook.
It wasn’t the killings of Kirk in Utah or a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, he wrote. Instead, it was his own back surgery.
Republican senators silent after closed-door redistricting caucus

Lucas lauded the Indiana Spine Hospital for being physician-owned and patient-focused at lower prices: “THIS is the way healthcare should be.”
If Democrats take control of the House, he wrote, “places like this might go under” and the rest of Trump’s reforms “will be dead in the water.”
“We owe it to ourselves and future generations to give Trump this reform possibility, because the status quo from both parties is destroying America,” Lucas concluded. “THAT is why I’m a hell yes on redistricting.”
Hoosier House Republicans met to discuss mid-cycle redistricting in mid-August and are set to meet again virtually on Friday. Their Senate counterparts caucused Wednesday.
Pro-redistricting texts sent by the conservative-leaning Forward America started going out again this week, even as a coalition of voting-rights advocates delivered a stack of nearly 9,000 signatures from anti-redistricting Hoosiers.
Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Braun has pointed out blue states with gerrymandered maps but has refused to take a firm stance on the topic. He is waiting for legislative leadership to indicate if a special session should be called.

(Image courtesy of the Environmental Protection Agency)While the state legislature passes laws on underground carbon sequestration, researchers are analyzing how lessons learned from wastewater injection-induced earthquakes could inform the growing carbon storage industry.


Researchers and companies in the U.S. are investigating ways to store huge amounts of carbon dioxide underground. The greenhouse gas contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, prompting some to develop technology to capture it and inject it into the earth.
A new article analyzing cases of induced seismicity in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and New Mexico, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, said carbon storage is critical to limiting the effects of climate change.
“But if it’s associated with induced seismicity, then I think it will really undermine public support for those activities,” said study author and Stanford University Professor Emeritus Mark Zoback.
The risk of triggering earthquakes by injecting carbon underground in certain geological formations has been known for decades, researchers say. Areas with hard and brittle rocks are more likely to be unsuitable for injection.
Zoback said he and co-author Peter Hennings, a research professor at the University of Texas, used wastewater injection as an analogy to explain what could happen with large-scale carbon storage. Captured carbon is converted into a supercritical fluid, which is similar to a liquid, for underground storage.
The paper analyzed some of Oklahoma’s series of earthquakes from the 2010s that were confirmed to be caused by oil and gas operations. Zoback said the affected area isn’t suitable for high amounts of carbon storage.
“ In north-central Oklahoma, one should not be doing large-scale carbon storage in the Arbuckle formation because we’ve done that experiment, we know what happens,” he said. “Now, that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to store CO2, for example, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs.”
At least two companies have submitted applications to store carbon underground in Oklahoma as of late August. CapturePoint withdrew its bid to operate carbon wells in Osage County in January after the Environmental Protection Agency indicated it needed more information about the site’s geology and potential for seismicity, a spokesperson for the company said.
Another company, NexGen Carbon Solutions, applied this summer to operate 10 carbon wells in Osage County. In an announcement, it said it planned to store 72 million tons of carbon over 20 years in the wells. The EPA application is currently in a technical review.
To welcome carbon companies, the state legislature passed a bill laying out rules for local regulation of carbon storage wells, known as Class VI under the EPA. At the time of passage, the state planned to ask the federal government for primacy to oversee and regulate its commercial wells.
“This is probably the most important piece of legislation you’ll see this year for future economic development in the state of Oklahoma,” bill co-author Rep. Ken Luttrell (R-Ponca City) said during a May 1 House floor session. “These companies are willing to come to Oklahoma and invest millions of dollars in our economy with these Class VI wells.”
Zoback and Hennings wrote that they want the research paper to serve as a guide for the public to understand the body of information on carbon storage and the risk of earthquakes. Zoback said public perception of underground carbon injection is key to putting away millions of tons of the greenhouse gas.
“ The biggest threat in many cases will not be the shaking of the ground, but will be undermining public confidence that it can go forward safely,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of NBC 12)Less than a month after opening for the new school year, two Virginia HBCUs —  Virginia State and Hampton Universities  — closed on Thursday after receiving threats to their campuses.
Though neither school has released details on what the threats entail, attention on campus safety has been heightened nationwide after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
In the past few years, Virginia’s institutions including Virginia State (VSU) and Hampton Universities have navigated multiple threats, some of which ended in no activity or followed after gun violence while others were found to be unsubstantiated.
“The safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors remain our highest priority,” Hampton University said in a statement Thursday morning, adding that further updates will be provided by the end of the day.
Hampton said in a statement that it received notice of a “potential threat” and has ceased all non-essential activities, effective immediately. All campus activities and classes would also be closed through Friday including athletic events and activities. 
Virginia State advised the school’s community to continue checking VSU emails for updates.
Last July, Hampton locked down the school to investigate a bomb threat targeting The William R. Harvey Library and the University Dining Hall, according to WAVY News. Officials determined there was no threat.
Then, a month later in Petersburg, Virginia State locked down its school after four people, none of whom were enrolled students, were shot on Boisseau Street outside Daniel Gymnasium on the university’s campus, 8News reported. The media outlet reported that all four people were then taken to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.
As of 12:30 p.m., no other institute in Virginia has announced any similar closure.

Bob Menendez's wife Nadine was ordered to prison for 54 months for taking nearly $1 million in bribes for his political power.,"Sen. Bob Menendez takes a selfie with his wife, Nadine, and businessman Wael Hana. The three were co-defendants in an 18-count federal corruption indictment. (Courtesy of U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Nadine Menendez was sentenced to four and a half years behind bars Thursday for her role in a yearslong international bribery scheme that landed her husband, former Sen. Bob Menendez, in a federal prison in June.
She cried as she told U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein during her sentencing hearing at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan federal courthouse in Manhattan that she blames her husband for her criminal troubles.
“I was wrong about my husband,” Menendez said in court, according to the New York Daily News. “I now know, he’s not my savior. He’s not the man I thought he was. I should have asked more questions. I should have known better.”
Prosecutors have portrayed Nadine Menendez, 58, as the greedy go-between in a global scheme in which she accepted bribes of cash, gold bars, a luxury car, and more from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for her husband’s political influence. The plot began within weeks after the couple met in 2018 and continued until FBI agents raided their Englewood Cliffs home in 2022, prosecutors said.
“They were partners in crime, partners in corruption, and partners in greed,” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said during the trial’s opening statements in March. “She did the dirty work.”
Stein agreed Nadine Menendez was not “an innocent observer” and sentenced her to 54 months of incarceration, offering some leniency because of the breast cancer that drove him last year to order separate trials for the couple.
She faced decades in prison after a jury convicted her in April of 15 crimes, including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, and conspiracy. Prosecutors wanted her incarcerated for at least seven years, while her defense attorneys sought a sentence of just one year, citing her cancer care and her traumatic childhood as a refugee whose family fled a civil war in Lebanon.
The former senator’s attorneys also played the blame-the-spouse game during his trial, when they portrayed him as an unwitting victim in a scheme orchestrated by his wife. He tried to backtrack that attack in a letter to the judge last month, when he said he “didn’t fully preview” his attorneys’ comments at trial.
“To suggest that Nadine was money hungry or in financial need, and therefore would solicit others for help, is simply wrong,” he wrote.
He implored Stein for leniency for his wife.
“Your Honor, you gave me a tough sentence that surely serves the deterrent value you said was needed,” he wrote. “To imprison Nadine, would not recognize the trauma she has suffered, how it has affected her and her judgment, and I would respectfully say would not have any greater deterrent effect.”
Bob Menendez was chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was indicted in 2023. He became the first sitting senator ever convicted of acting as a foreign agent after a jury found him guilty in July 2024.
During his nine-week trial, prosecutors presented thousands of pages of documents, text messages, and photographs, and questioned dozens of witnesses to show how he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar and worked to derail several criminal cases against the businessmen, in exchange for the bribes. During both trials, they offered as evidence text messages, voicemails, and other communications between the couple in which they discussed the scheme and riches.
Bob Menendez has appealed his conviction and remains incarcerated at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. A Democratic member of Congress for more than 30 years, he has unsuccessfully sought a pardon from President Donald Trump. He was sentenced to 11 years behind bars.
Two of the businessmen involved in the bribery scheme, halal meat exporter Wael Hana and real estate developer Fred Daibes, were also convicted and sent to prison for just over eight years and seven years, respectively.
Sentencing for the third businessman, Jose Uribe, is set for Oct. 9. He testified against his co-defendants in a cooperation deal with prosecutors.

For Ponka-we Cozad, the National Day of Remembrance for Indian boarding school survivors is personal.
Members of her family attended boarding schools and shared hurtful stories about their days in the schools.
“In some way, shape or form, as Native peoples, we all have a story to share about the Indian boarding school era,” said Cozad, director of policy and advocacy at the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition. Cozad is Tohono O’odham Nation of Arizona and the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.
“This is why I’m doing this work; when we talk about something always being in our hearts, it’s personal,” she told ICT.
The annual National Day of Remembrance for U.S. Indian boarding school survivors on Sept. 16 in Washington, D.C., with a special event sponsored by the coalition, known as NABS, from 5-7 p.m. EST at the Indian Gaming Association building.
The theme of this year’s event is “Always in our hearts.”
A number of other gatherings are scheduled across Indian Country to commemorate the Day of Remembrance with vigils, prayers, and other events in museums, churches and local communities.
September is an important month on both sides of the U.S. border. September 30 is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada, known as Orange Shirt Day, in memory of the residential school students and the harsh conditions they endured. It became a national holiday after more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found at residential schools, including at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.
In the U.S., where thousands of Native children died in boarding schools, the National Day of Remembrance provides an opportunity for tribal leaders, survivors, descendants of survivors as well as congressional members and the public to come together to honor and recognize children who never returned home from the schools.
This year, the event coincides with the National Congress of American Indians Tribal Unity Impact Days, Sept. 16-18, also in Washington, D.C.
During the Impact Days,  NCAI organizes sessions in which tribal leaders can meet with members of Congress and federal agency officials in order to advocate for priorities such as fiscal year 2026 appropriations, public safety, economic development, housing, self-determination and other issues.
The Day of Remembrance also coincides with the fall session of the U.S. Congress, which convened on Sept. 2, giving lawmakers another opportunity to consider passing the Truth and Healing Commission on the Indian Boarding School Policies  Act (S.761). The act would establish a commission to investigate, document and report on the histories of Indian boarding schools, develop recommendations for federal efforts based on those findings and promote healing for survivors and descendants.
Although the bill passed  the Senate with a unanimous vote in December 2024, the House of Representatives did not bring the bill up for a vote before the legislative session ended.
In March, 2025, U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, reintroduced the bill. It is now awaiting further consideration and a full vote in the Senate.
At the event in Washington, a light reception and candlelight vigil will be held, and will include remarks from Deb Parker, the chief executive officer of NABS and a citizen of the Tulalip Tribe and descendant of the Yaqui and Apache tribes.

(File photo Maryland Matters)State Highway Administration officials “knowingly charged” nearly $360 million in unauthorized expenses to federal fund projects in an attempt to hide a deficit in the state’s Transportation Trust Fund, according to a new state audit.
The expenditures for more than 500 projects with $50,000 or more in expenses may not be recoverable. To cover the gap, the state may have to tap a $400 million Transportation Trust Fund balance or state general funds, according to the audit from the Office of Legislative Audits that was released to the public Thursday.
“More concerning is that the amount of unauthorized spending increased by 3,523 percent, including an additional $163.5 million between June 2024 and August 2025,” Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen wrote in his report.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government, even though they had not yet been authorized.
“SHA also was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $449 million (which would include the aforementioned unauthorized expenses) or the subsequent recovery of the funds,” Tanen wrote. “To the extent that the federal funds are not available, Transportation Trust funds or State general funds, may be needed to cover any related deficits.”
Key Bridge deconstruction continues as officials eye initial effort for a new span

The audit looked at a four-year period between Nov. 1, 2020, and Oct. 31, 2024. Auditors said they looked at the period based on a complaint to the office’s fraud, waste and abuse hotline reporting a recent “rapid increase in the federal funds receivable balance.”
The findings supported the allegation in the complaint but “did not identify any matters that warranted” referral to the Office of the Attorney General for a criminal investigation.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government even though they had not yet been authorized.
Between 2017 and 2020, the amount of unauthorized expenses  ranged between $7.7 million and about $10 million. But by June 2024, the amount had grown to more than $195 million. And in August 2025, the amount approached $360 million.
In one example, auditors found that the highway administration had fully spent $2.7 million in federal funds on an approved, unnamed project by September 2023. Even so, the agency charged an additional $3.1 million to the same project through August 2025.
Auditors noted that while the projects were authorized by the federal government, the amounts charged to them by SHA exceeded authorized federal aid.
Those additional charges, the auditors noted, “may not be recoverable.”
“According to agency management, SHA knowingly charged these costs as federal funds on the State’s accounting records to minimize the Transportation Trust Fund deficit,” auditors wrote. “Specifically, SHA management advised that they have sought additional federal funding when expenditures exceeded the federal grant and have attempted to find federal funds to cover more projects (including smaller projects that were traditionally funded through the Transportation Trust Fund).
“However … the federal granting agency has not authorized additional funding for these projects which will need to be funded with Transportation Trust Funds … or state funds,” the audit said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In their response, state transportation officials said it was “not factually accurate to say that projects were not authorized, but it is accurate that in some cases, expenses charged exceeded the initial authorized amounts.”
The agency said it works to determine if additional costs warrant modifications to its request for federal reimbursement.
“If the expenditure is deemed federally ineligible for reimbursement, it would be expensed to state funds,” the agency wrote in its response.
Auditors said they also found that in some cases, the highways administration “purposefully recorded” some “unbillable expenditures” as a federal receivable “without disclosing the unbillable nature of these funds.”
Transportation officials agreed with the findings and said it was working to “quantify any unrecoverable amounts and adjust account balances.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/highway-work-newsletter-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 12:57:56.888024

To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as par for the course is to say that, in America, bullets are more important than ideas. Don’t take the bait, Rod Miller and Clair McFarland write.
The post Dying for speech can’t be the new normal appeared first on WyoFile .","Charlie Kirk was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at a college in Utah. There will be many details forthcoming, as the investigation into Kirk’s murder progresses. But make no mistake, Charlie Kirk was killed for speaking his mind.

Opinion

The footage circulating online shows Kirk uttering the words “gang violence” and then suffering what looks like a gunshot to the neck. 
Kirk’s style of engaging with young people is widely known and recognizable. Not quite a trademark, but he did it more actively than anyone else: the back-and-forth, the conversation, the debate. 
Sometimes that devolved into “the own.”
In America, we risk getting “owned” by a conservative (or liberal) influencer once in a while, when we teeter onto the beam of free speech. 
A little blushing, a little back-pedaling, and we’re on our way: embarrassed, but free to be embarrassed in the crossfire of ideas. 
It is this free exchange of ideas that flows from the First Amendment to our Constitution. Our national discourse has room for all points of view, even if those ideas are odious to some. Our guarantee to say what is on our mind makes each of us uniquely American, and to thwart that freedom with violence in the marketplace of ideas diminishes us all.
To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as somehow par for the course is to say that, in America, violence is more powerful than words, that bullets are more important than ideas.
To say Kirk deserved to be shot for his point of view is reprehensible. 
But even as we recognize how reprehensible that notion is and feel it pucker places the Constitution doesn’t address, we can’t take the bait.
We can’t meet violence with violence. 
Let words be your sword. Let ideas be your honing stone. 
And if you can’t enter the debate because your ideas suck and you stumble over your words, just listen for a while. 
Consider the painstaking thought that formed our Constitution and its declarations of rights. Consider the forge that produced them. 
A convention. A meeting. 
A bunch of young bucks and their token old guy — Benjamin Franklin, the titan of outspokenness and the press’s true patron saint — swapping ideas. Not crossing swords. 
They made an America where words are mighty. 
We are both journalists. That means we belong to the only occupation whose freedom to operate is enshrined in the same First Amendment that guaranteed Charlie Kirk’s freedom of speech. The national cacophony of rhetoric erupting in reaction to Kirk’s murder is also protected by the First Amendment, even if some of it might make your skin crawl. 
But as journalists, our loyalties must lie with the Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees, not with one side or another in this acrimonious debate. 
We fumble as a nation for something to help us rise above the murky political resentment and tribalism that grip our country and poison our thinking. 
For us, that something is our liberty as citizens of the United States to express ourselves freely. When anyone, for any reason, tries to negate that freedom through violence, we must speak up. 
And we must bridge our lesser differences to do so.

As Vermont faces deepening challenges, the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity (CVOEO) remains committed to its mission: ending poverty and building a future where everyone can thrive. In a year marked by uncertainty, community support has never mattered more.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  In crisis, community leads: CVOEO stands strong as ‘[...]","Federal policy changes are putting pressure on Vermont’s most vulnerable residents—and the nonprofits working to support them. At risk are the programs that form the backbone of survival for thousands of families, older adults, and people with disabilities.

“The proposed cuts don’t trim the fat off the budget—they sever the arteries of rural America,” said Paul Dragon, CVOEO Executive Director.

Among the most alarming developments:

The FY25 Budget Reconciliation Bill includes cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—stripping health coverage and food assistance from those who need it most.
The proposed FY26 Budget threatens to eliminate the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), along with other vital programs CVOEO administers.

For CVOEO, this means the potential loss of $1.2 million in CSBG funding, which directly supports hunger relief, housing and shelter, emergency assistance, and more across the Champlain Valley and beyond. These funds are not abstract line items—they are a lifeline.
“The proposed cuts don’t trim the fat off the budget—they sever the arteries of rural America,” said Paul Dragon, CVOEO Executive Director. “When CSBG and programs like LIHEAP and weatherization are eliminated, rural communities like ours are hit the hardest. These services are essential for older Vermonters, children, veterans, and people with disabilities.”
If passed, these cuts will gut vital community health, nutrition, fuel, and utility assistance programs—pushing millions into food insecurity, worsening health outcomes, and leaving homes cold during the winter months.
Despite these looming threats, CVOEO is not backing down. The organization is adapting, working harder, and digging deeper to continue meeting basic needs and empowering individuals to break the cycle of poverty.

A statement from his campaign for secretary of state said the support emphasized Edevbie’s credentials as he seeks to replace his boss, term-limited Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is seeking the Democratic Party nomination for governor.
It also shows the urgent need for a Benson successor with strong leadership and experience to maintain democratic values in Michigan, the campaign said.
“I am thrilled to have the support of over 50 leaders from across our state. The support we’ve earned shows our party and our state is ready to embrace fresh leadership from a black man with a different name,” Edevbie said in a statement. “As I travel around Michigan and meet with people from all walks of life, I hear a consistent message: people are alarmed by the current state of our democracy under the Trump administration, and they want a Secretary of State who knows how to fight for our democracy on day one. They want a leader who is ready to meet this moment. And I am prepared to do just that.”
On Tuesday, Edevbie added to his growing list of endorsements, which now includes state Rep. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) and state Rep. Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti).
Secretary of state candidates are nominated by their respective parties at conventions in the spring of each election year. Edevbie faces Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and former state Sen. Adam Hollier in the race for the nomination.

The decision by Corewell follows the hospital system’s decision to limit gender affirming care for minors earlier this year. It also now joins the University of Michigan as the second health system in the state to cease providing gender affirming care for minors.
“Like many health care systems across the country, we made this decision to protect both our health care providers and our patients,” the health system wrote in a letter obtained by the Michigan Advance. “We will continue to compassionately address the health needs of our patients who are in transition, or wish to transition, including providing mental health support.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Endocrine Society and other medical organizations have concluded that age-appropriate gender-affirming care is based on evidence and medically necessary.
Several studies have found access to gender affirming care – such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers – are associated with reduced cases of depression, anxiety, suicidality and overall improvements in mental health among trans youth.
Corewell Health said its gender care clinic would continue to see patients, and that they would continue to provide behavioral health, social affirmation and psychosocial support services. The hospital system advised parents who notice any emotional or behavioral changes in their child to contact their mental health provider or primary care provider to schedule an urgent appointment.
As another health system bows to pressure from the Trump administration, Erin Knott, the executive director of Equality Michigan said it was “devastating to see yet another healthcare giant turn its back on transgender youth and their families.”
“Corewell’s decision underscores a disturbing pattern,” Knott said in a statement. “Institutions that should be at the forefront of providing compassionate, evidence-based care are instead retreating under political pressure, leaving vulnerable young people to shoulder the harm. This is not just a matter of policy, it’s a matter of lives.”
Knott emphasized that gender affirming care for minors remains legal in the state, and that Equality Michigan would not stop fighting to expand access. 
At the end of August, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel reissued an open letter and renewed guidance to health care providers emphasizing Michiganders’ right to seek and receive healthcare services without discrimination.

WILMINGTON — The Urban Artist Exchange (UAE) Outdoor Amphitheater has been named a recipient of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Delaware Design Awards Program. 
The program highlights the transformative impact of architectural design while celebrating the projects and people that contribute to Delaware’s vibrancy. 
The UAE project transformed long-abandoned Wilmington Police Department horse stables into a multi-disciplinary arts campus. 
“The Tina Betz Urban Artist Exchange demonstrates the power of the arts in bringing people together,” said Mayor John Carney. “Thank you to Director Betz and everyone who worked for years to create a creative and educational space for the community.”
Led by Wilmington Director of Cultural Affairs Tina Betz, the project officially opened with the launch of the Arts Work Summer Youth Apprenticeship Program. The renovation work was completed by apprentices and masters with the Challenge Program in the city’s East Side Historic District.
The amphitheater was designed by Architectural Alliance and constructed by EDiS, opening for its first performance in May 2023. In May 2025, the campus was renamed The Tina Betz Urban Artist Exchange in recognition of Betz’s leadership.

“Recognizing this project with a design award is a testament to our city’s persistence, creativity, and most importantly, our vibrant arts community,” said Director Tina Betz. “The UAE was fifteen years in the making and worth every minute of the journey. Thank you to Architectural Alliance, EDiS, and the entire project team for helping bring this vision to life, and to the AIA team for being there every step of the way.”
Awards were selected by a five-member jury of architects from AIA Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. In their comments, the jury stated:
“The plan demonstrates a thoughtful and strategic orientation, effectively responding to the site, function, and surrounding roadway network. While the design introduces a departure from the existing vernacular through its form, it maintains cohesion through a consistent material palette. Notably, the careful attention given to the rear façade is commendable, recognizing its prominence as the most frequently viewed elevation.”
The amphitheater and UAE team will be formally recognized at an awards ceremony later this month.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-5.png,,,2025-09-11 11:57:00.013469

(Photo by Sean D. Elliot/Getty Images)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy of a franchise currently in play for a possible sale and relocation.
“Ask Mohegan Sun whether it was a good investment they made 20 years ago,” Lamont said.
The Mohegan Tribal Nation, the owner of the Mohegan Sun casino, purchased the team in 2003 and relocated it the arena in its casino complex. The tribe paid $10 million and currently is entertaining offers exceeding $300 million.
Lamont and Treasurer Erick Russell discussed the WNBA as a viable investment for a pension fund at a press conference announcing that the state pension funds are outperforming peers, with an annual return exceeding 10%.
“It’s been a very hot area,” Russell said. “This has been a big topic all around the country. We’ve seen other public pension plans that have invested in the space, particularly in women’s basketball.”
Industry newsletters and publications have been noting the interest in sports franchises as an investment over the past year, as one sports law web site reported in July.
“From Undervalued to Unstoppable: The Rise of Women’s Sports as a Prime Investment Asset,” was the headline of a story saying women’s sports are attractive for their lower entry price and high ceiling for growth in value.
‘A very risky proposition’
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, criticized Lamont for endorsing what Candelora called “a very high-risk investment with our pension market.”
“In general, investing in a sports team is a very risky proposition,” Candelora said, adding that Connecticut, situated between larger media markets in New York and Boston, has a checkered past when it comes to enticing top-level sports franchises to relocate or remain here.
Nuccio praised Russell’s pension performance but argued that the pension investment should go to safer places.
“We still have a massive amount of pension debt,” she said.
Flirtations with the New England Patriots ended poorly, and the NHL’s Hartford Whalers decamped for North Carolina in 1997 after a quarter-century in Hartford.
But Lamont and Russell said the value of the investment in Connecticut Sun is tied to the steady appreciation of equity positions in franchise ownerships, regardless of their balance sheet or whether they ultimately relocate.
“We’ve got private investors in alongside of us. In fact, junior to us. They like the nature of this investment. They think it’s a really good, solid, long term return for him and for our investors,” Lamont said.
Lamont acknowledged, however, the state’s interest was motivated by a desire to keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun or the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford. Formerly known as the XL Center, it is undergoing renovations.
The WNBA would have to approve a move to Hartford, but the state and Mohegan tribe have discussed keeping the team at Mohegan Sun, with a portion of the games played in Hartford. Whoever owns the team faces a significant capital cost: The construction of a practice facility.
“I’m trying to keep the Sun in Connecticut,” Lamont said. Noting the role UConn played in the popularization of the women’s college game, he said, “I think they belong in Connecticut, which is a birthplace of women’s basketball.”
A group led by former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, a billionaire who grew up in West Hartford, has made an offer for the team with the intent of keeping it in Connecticut. A Boston group previously made a bid with hopes of relocating it to Boston.
The WNBA, which sees Boston as a future expansion city, reacted cooly to a possible transfer of the Connecticut Sun. Sources say an expansion team in Boston would yield the league a $250 million expansion fee, while a transfer fee was much lower.
The Mohegan tribe is not committed to a sale. Sources say its current negotiating posture is a sale, taking on an equity partner, or retaining a minority equity position while selling a majority interest.
Similarly, Lamont said the state’s approach is flexible.
“We got a proposal out where we would buy the team. We have a proposal out where we buy a portion of the team and leave Mohegan Sun in there [as a partner]. So it depends on where the negotiations go, but we’re still in the game,” Lamont said.
If the state invests, it would insist on being the senior partner, meaning its share would be paid off first in any sale, Lamont said.
Russell said he is not directly involved in negotiations; his role would be to structure any investment to protect the pension fund. He currently has $63 billion in pension assets under the management of his office.
“What we would be looking at is something, if this is where we landed, that would be in the benefit of pensioners,” Russell said. “That is my priority as treasurer, as you see from the returns that we have demonstrated over the last few years.”

(Courtesy of Black Hills Pioneer)A loan from South Dakota’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program could keep a 63-unit apartment complex in Deadwood from sitting empty.
The Housing Development Authority Board’s approval this week of a $2.1 million loan to rebuild the water lines at the now-vacant Deadwood Ridge Apartments marks the first time the group has voted to pay for infrastructure money on a building that’s already built.
Lawmakers created the $200 million pool of funding in 2023 to address a statewide shortage in workforce housing. Half took the form of low-interest loans. The other $100 million — half federal dollars, half state dollars — was earmarked for grants.
The money was meant to cover up to a third of a developer’s cost on things like roads, water and sewer lines, and sidewalks through loans, grants or a combination of the two.
It’s been two years since the fund began to disburse money across South Dakota. Thus far, the program’s aided 78 projects in 41 cities. The initial pool of $100 million in grant funding is gone, but the program still has $65 million available for loans.

The fund earned $5 million in interest this year, and is meant to be rebuilt as projects repay their debt.
Fourteen projects have been completed, according to Amy Eldridge, director of rental housing development for the authority. Several others “are done, but they’re working on completing the documentation” to certify as much. 
Another 64 projects are being built now, Eldridge told the board. 
Tuesday decisions 
All the loans and grants must first be approved by the state’s Housing Development Authority Board. When that board met Tuesday in Sioux Falls, its members approved an $814,000 loan to help cover the infrastructure for a $2.4 million, 94-rental unit project in Spearfish and an $846,000 loan to help a $2.6 million, 68-lot development for single family homes in Crooks.
The third ask for infrastructure funding was more expensive and complicated. 
The Deadwood Ridge Apartments in Deadwood are already built, at a cost of $11 million. The initial project didn’t ask for or use any infrastructure funding, and was meant to open its doors to tenants in 2024 but didn’t. The initial developers and engineers failed to submit their drinking water and wastewater plans to the state’s Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources before the building began. When the time came to open, the unreviewed project failed to pass regulatory muster.

As a result, the infrastructure needed to be redesigned and rebuilt. Fixing the error and putting the apartments onto the market in the historic West River tourist community will cost another $6.5 million.
On Tuesday, the housing board reviewed owner Daniel Henderson’s request for help covering that cost. He asked the state to waive an infrastructure program rule that limits how much loan money can be used to cover labor costs, which in this case included fees for a new engineer.
Henderson’s request, for a $2.1 million loan, was $1.5 million more than the board would typically allow for labor costs on a project of its size.
Board member Mark Roby, of Watertown, wanted to know what would happen if the board said no. 
“There would be a building that sits in Deadwood that doesn’t get leased out,” Eldridge said.
Chas Olson, the authority’s director, said there’s enough funding to offer the loan, and the apartments “are really badly needed” in Deadwood.
The board first approved the waiver, then the project application, after assurances that the complex owner was in a strong position to repay the loan. Both votes were unanimous.
Remaining funds
After the meeting, Olson told South Dakota Searchlight that loan applications have slowed down in part because major builders are working on approved projects. Developers are also likely waiting to gauge how those projects will impact demand for housing in their respective areas.
The fund was launched to address what a legislative summer study concluded was a 10,000-home shortage in workforce housing across the state. 
So far, the infrastructure program has distributed or committed funds for more than 7,000 single-family home lots and more than 5,000 multi-family units.

NEWARK– Christ the Teacher Catholic School (CTTCS) has introduced a new House System for its 6th through 8th grade students, aiming to build community, encourage leadership, and boost both academics and school spirit.
The initiative is modeled after traditions used in schools worldwide and is designed to create what the school calls a “school family within a school family.” Students are placed into mixed-grade Houses where they will learn, collaborate, and compete throughout the academic year.

“Our goal is to foster deeper connections, leadership skills, and positive character development while celebrating school pride,” said Kelly Lanza, Principal of Christ the Teacher. “The House System gives students a chance to shine in new ways—academically, socially, and spiritually.”
How the House System Works

All middle school students have been assigned to one of seven Houses: Catherine, Mercy, Dublin, Carlow, Callaghan, Doyle, or McAuley.
Each House is led by a faculty mentor: Miss Donahue (Catherine), Mrs. Jones (Mercy), Mrs. Shea (Dublin), Mrs. Murray (Carlow), Ms. Phillips (Callaghan), Mr. Walton (Doyle), and Mrs. Glaviano (McAuley).
Students can earn points for their Houses through positive behavior, academics, teamwork, and service.
Houses will gather every other week for activities, competitions, and service projects.
At the end of the school year, the House with the most points will win a final prize to be chosen by the students.

The program began with a special kickoff event where students learned about their House history, met their teammates, and participated in games to start earning points.
“This is more than just a competition,” said Mrs. Lanza. “It’s about creating memories, forming bonds across grade levels, and empowering students to lead with faith and integrity.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8783.jpg,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The morning after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, Department of Public Safety and FBI officials said the manhunt for his killer continues while investigators recovered what they believe to be the killer’s weapon. 
“It’s a high-powered, bolt-action rifle,” FBI Special Agent In Charge Robert Bohls said. “That rifle was recovered in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. The FBI laboratory will be analyzing this weapon.” 
Investigators are also analyzing “footwear impressions, a palm print and forearm imprints for analysis,” he said. 
Bohls and Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said their investigation is ongoing, and they declined to release more information about the suspected shooter — other than saying overnight investigators tracked his movement through video camera footage. 
“We are confident in our abilities to track that individual,” Mason said. “If we are unsuccessful in identifying them immediately, we will reach out for the public’s help and the media’s help in pushing those photos.”
Starting at 11:52 a.m. on Wednesday, the shooter was spotted heading toward UVU’s campus.

“We have tracked his movements onto the campus, through the stairwells, up to the roof, across the roof to a shooting location,” Mason said. “After the shooting we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building, and fled off of the campus and into a neighborhood.” 
Investigators have contacted neighbors, “anybody they can with doorbell cameras, witnesses and have thoroughly worked through those communities trying to identify any leads,” Mason said. 
“We do have good video footage of this individual,” he said, but “we’re not going to release that at this time. We are working through some technologies and some ways to identify this individual.” 
If they’re unable to identify the suspect, then Mason said they’ll provide more information to the media to ask the public for help, “but we are confident in our abilities right now and would like to move forward in a manner that keeps everyone safe and moves this process appropriately.” 
Bohls said FBI agents have been working “around the clock” in partnership with Utah law enforcement to find Kirk’s killer. 
“We are and will continue to work nonstop until we find the person that has committed this heinous crime and find out why they did it,” Bohls said.

All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent sewer overflows, but as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress.
The post Western Mass. cities working to prevent sewer overflows amid funding challenges and intensifying rain  appeared first on Commo[...]","REPORTS OF TOILET PAPER, raw sewage, and other discarded items flowing through the Connecticut River in Suffield and Enfield went viral in recent weeks as Connecticut State Rep. Tami Zawistowski pointed the finger at Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee.  
“They all have issues that have emerged in recent years,” Zawistowski told WTNH News 8, claiming Holyoke alone “dumped” seven million gallons of sewage into the river in one day. “It’s time for Massachusetts to step up.” 
Officials in the cities that have been singled out say the “issues” that have emerged are intensifying rain events due to climate change.  
The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.  
Cities like Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee have historically combined sewer systems where both wastewater and stormwater come through shared pipes. During heavy rains, the excess flow bypasses the treatment plants where it is supposed to be cleaned and is instead discharged into local bodies of water to prevent backups in people’s homes.  
All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent overflows and have reached the final stages of separating their stormwater and sewer systems, significantly reducing their annual discharges. But as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress. 
Funding the expensive projects required to update the sewer systems is a daunting task, and the three Gateway Cities often lack the taxpayer base to pay for it.  
“By no means would I say that Chicopee, Holyoke, and Springfield have done nothing,” Springfield Water and Sewer Commission Executive Director Josh Schimmel said. “If we could wave a wand and make them go away tomorrow, we would, but we serve a disadvantaged population that pays for it.” 
Mary Monahan, interim director of Holyoke Public Works, said the city has already eliminated 70 percent of the overflows outlined in their legally binding performance improvement plan established with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Justice Department. Previous CSOs in Holyoke violated federal and state wastewater discharge permits, according to the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. 
“On a normal day, we’re only using half the capacity of the plant,” Monahan said. “It’s only this rainfall that overwhelms it. Climate change is definitely exacerbating this issue.” 
Two projects amounting to $22.5 million are in the works now. River Terrace Phase A and B will continue the city’s efforts to separate the two systems and mitigate CSO events. Holyoke generally secures funding for CSO projects through the EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which offers no interest loans.  
Last year, the city applied for a $19 million grant through the EPA’s Community Change Grants Program, a Biden-era initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that provides funding to disadvantaged communities for environmental projects. While waiting in the queue to be funded, the program was cancelled in May by the EPA under the Trump administration.  
The grant was going to help fund a new centrifuge in Holyoke’s treatment plant, which removes liquid from the waste sludge and lowers disposal costs. It is expected to cost between $3 million and $4 million.  
“For a city like Holyoke, it really is a financial burden,” Monahan said. “Our ratepayers are paying almost $2 million a year in debt service, and River Terrace Phase B is going to add more.”  
The city is required to report the volume of discharge associated with CSOs each time there is a rain event. While Zawistowski was correct in claiming that seven million gallons had been discharged into the river in one day, Monahan estimates that nearly five million of that had already been treated in their plant. She says the city is working on revising how they report CSO volumes.  
“Ninety-nine percent of the overflow could be rainwater, which is technically clean, and 1 percent of it could be the sewage that was in the pipe,” Chicopee Water Pollution Control project supervisor Quinn Lonczak said. “It’s hard to know what is actually going out.”  
Monahan and Lonczak, along with city officials from Springfield, say they want to see the Connecticut River clean as much as anyone else does.  
“If it’s a regional rain event and all of the other plants are overflowing, sure, there’s going to be water quality issues and everything coming downstream,” Monahan said. “We’re really easy to pick on.”

In Chicopee, between 80 and 85 percent of the city’s average annual discharge has been eliminated, according to Lonczak. Between 60 and 65 percent of their long-term CSO control plan projects have been completed. Since 2000, the city has spent close to $250 million on CSO-related projects. 
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not a cheap fix. And it’s not something that we ignore,” Lonczak said. “We’ve done a lot of projects here, spent a lot of money, and nearly all of that money is local. Our ratepayers here are paying for those projects.”  
While making considerable progress, Lonczak anticipates that completing the targeted projects will cost another $100 million before inflation. Some parts of the system are still combined, but don’t discharge a significant amount. He said the challenge is that now the city is left with project areas that will cost a lot but will ultimately remove only a small amount of overflow.  
A Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection report released in May showed that 543 million gallons of wastewater overflowed into the Connecticut River last year across 12 days with weather events, compared to nearly one billion gallons in 2023.  
“There’s a plan, and it may not be going as fast as the state of Connecticut wants, unless somebody starts writing some checks,” Lonczak said. “If you wanted to eliminate CSOs in Chicopee in five years … is it possible? Anything’s possible, it’s just the dollar amount.” 
Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the EPA.  
“We can handle regular rain. We’re going to get an inch and a half of rain over 12 hours? That’s no problem. We’re designed for that,” Lonczak said. “It’s short-duration, high-intensity events.”  
Springfield is less concerned with separating their sewer systems, according to Schimmel. Their CSO elimination projects involve a mix of separation in some areas, increased treatment plant capacity, and creating in-system storage. He says complete separation could solve one problem while creating another.  
“You can eliminate 100 percent of CSOs, and storm water alone is going to violate water quality standards every time it rains,” Schimmel said. “Although storm water is more dilute pollution by volume, it’s every bit as harmful as CSO. Separation reduces your combined sewer overflow, but it increases your stormwater.”  
Springfield has spent approximately $300 million on CSO projects, according to Schimmel, which have eliminated more than 50 percent of its CSOs in the last two decades.  
In the years following the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, the construction of wastewater treatment plants was largely paid for by the federal government through grants. Local entities paid a small portion of the cost. Municipalities must now pick up most of the cost, while state and federal agencies finance small, if any portions of their projects, Schimmel added. 
“There’s never been free money since the 70s and early 80s for any of us to do CSO work,” he said. “The pendulum has swung completely to the other side. It needs to come back to the middle to some degree.”

(Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.
Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.
The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.
Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.
While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.
“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”
According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.
In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.
Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.
Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.
In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.
But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.










This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island. It's actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region. 


– Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes


Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.
“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”
In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.
While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.
“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.
One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.
“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”
In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.
Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.
However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.
“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate
Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.
Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)
“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”
Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.
Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.
Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.
Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.
A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.
Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.
“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.
At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.
State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.
Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.
“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”
Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.
While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.
“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”
Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”

 The Delaware Restaurant Foundation (DRF), the nonprofit arm of the Delaware Restaurant Association, was highlighted last week at the 2025 Hospitality Pathways Conference in Washington, D.C., for its leadership in workforce training and community collaboration.
The conference, hosted by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, brought together more than 200 workforce development leaders and industry partners to share best practices for building career pathways in hospitality. Delaware’s work with Hospitality Opportunities for People (Re)Entering Society (HOPES) and Restaurant Ready was recognized as a national model.
Expanding opportunities in Delaware
As a pilot state for HOPES, the DRF has played a key role in creating opportunities for justice-involved individuals, those reentering the workforce, and others facing employment barriers. Earlier this year, the foundation received new grants from the NRAEF and the U.S. Department of Labor to expand its work.
The HOPES Growth Opportunities 5 (GO5) program is designed for justice-involved youth, while HOPES Pathways Home 6 (PH 6) supports adults with industry training, national credentials, and employment support.
“We are proud that Delaware was among the first states to pilot programs like HOPES and Restaurant Ready, and to showcase what’s possible when industry, government, and community partners come together,” said Carrie Leishman, President & CEO of the Delaware Restaurant Association & Foundation.

“These initiatives are changing lives right here in Delaware—equipping people of all backgrounds with the tools to build meaningful careers in hospitality—and we’re proud to be a national leader in creating a stronger, future-ready restaurant workforce,” she said. 
National Recognition and Local Leadership
The conference focused on public-private partnerships that are helping transform lives nationwide. Delaware’s initiatives were featured as examples of effective collaboration across industry, government, and community organizations.
DRF Workforce Development Director Ruthann Messick led two sessions on program implementation and community partnerships. Her workshops shared strategies to improve outcomes for participants across the country.
“The restaurant industry in Delaware employs more than 53,000 people—one in 11 Delawareans—and our workforce programs are designed to ensure every person has access to opportunity,” said DRF Workforce Director Ruthann Messick. 
“We are proud to continue this work with our national partners, expanding pathways for individuals who are ready to take their first step or their next step in hospitality.”
Community Impact
For Delaware, HOPES and Restaurant Ready have become essential tools in meeting workforce needs while also expanding equitable opportunities. The programs provide mentorship, workshops, apprenticeships, certifications, and industry-specific training to connect participants with employers.
“What makes HOPES unique is that it’s community-based and community-focused,” said Kenna Mask, a HOPES participant from Delaware. “It goes into the trenches. It’s aware of where the need is.”
Mask was awarded a Dontavious Drake Hospitality Pathways Grant, a new scholarship honoring the late Dontavious Drake, a member of the Restaurant Ready and HOPES team. The grant supported Mask’s travel to the Hospitality Pathways Conference, ensuring program participants could share their experiences at the national level.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pathways-Coference2-e1757598848619-1024x815.jpg,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

New Mexico State University officials say the school is working to educate students to fill the gaps.
The Legislative Health and Human Services Committee met in Las Cruces this week on the NMSU main campus. Committee members were joined Wednesday by NMSU School of Nursing Director Alexa Doig and College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Dean Rick Marlatt. They provided an update on how the School of Nursing is preparing students to meet the health care needs of New Mexicans, especially people living in rural areas of the state.
According to a 2024 report by advocacy organization Think New Mexico, New Mexico needs about 5,700 registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists and about 230 certified nurse practitioners to meet current national benchmarks. The report also notes that the state has some of the oldest physician workforce in the country and nearly 40% of doctors 60 years and older are expected to retire by 2030.
“We want to make sure that [students] understand what’s waiting for them out in the professional field, and the sooner we can get those hands-on experiences, the better,” Marlatt said during the meeting.
Doig highlighted the school’s postgraduate Advanced Practice Registered Nursing certificates, which offer specialized training for nurse practitioner students in several areas, including psychiatric and mental health. “This is really the primary program that is educating and training mental health practitioners who have independent scope of practice within New Mexico,” she said. The program is offered through “distance education,” Doig said, to allow students from all over the state to participate from their location in rural areas or other.
Students studying family practice are also able to complete a second certification program in psychiatric and mental health. The overall program took a hit in enrollment and graduation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Doig said. And while it is still a smaller program, more than 50 students currently participate and numbers continue to improve. She also said about half of the participating students are from New Mexico. 
“I think post-COVID, people really saw, especially nurses, a real need for mental health care providers and they recognize that they can fill that gap,” Doig said. She also pointed to the school’s efforts to integrate primary health care training with behavioral health so all students are equipped to address their patients’ mix of physical and mental health needs. All nursing students take a course on integrated care for diverse populations, which Doig explained “blends and helps amplify the connection between physical health and mental health, and then how to deliver this more integrative care approach.”
Doig stressed the value of having dual certification, but told lawmakers that certified nurse practitioners in New Mexico face the barrier of health care organizations requiring them to choose only one area of practice, rather than integrated care. She told lawmakers she would like to work with them to change policies so practitioners are better prepared to help patients with their various needs, particularly in rural settings or areas with larger health care worker shortages.
“We are in a provider shortage, and we have been for a long time and for the foreseeable future,” Doig said. “There are many jobs available, especially for a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. There is such a severe shortage, our students are often getting job offers before they graduate…Our employment rate data is usually between 90% and 100%.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NMSU-nursing2-1024x715.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

The Dunleavy administration repealed the rule in 2024, saying it was counterproductive and argued it contributed to higher health care costs. Medical providers say that isn’t true and that repealing the rule will cause some clinicians to close down. 
In 2023, a group of medical providers sued the state, alleging problems with the process used to repeal the rule. On Aug. 27, following a four-day bench trial in February, Judge Yvonne Lamoureaux ruled in favor of the state. 
In her findings of fact and conclusions of law, Lamoureaux concluded that the repeal was not “unreasonable or arbitrary,” and the state did not conduct an improper procedure.
An appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court is possible.
When in place, the rule required that insurance companies reimburse out-of-network medical providers at a rate equal to the 80th percentile of charges for the given service.
If five clinics provide a given procedure, the required payment would be what the second-most-expensive clinic charges.
The rule was intended to prevent Alaskans from being left with large medical bills after visiting out-of-network clinics. The state and Alaska’s largest health insurance company, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, contend that it required insurance companies to pay more for services than was warranted, contributing to higher insurance costs.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Former Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Syl James said he was convinced “CAVE people” were the greatest obstacle to solid leadership in municipal government.
James, a Democrat who led the city from 2011 to 2019, said Wednesday at the Dole Institute of Politics that successful leaders needed vision, discipline, data and community backing. The most challenging piece of the puzzle was that some people evaluated city projects based on how they might benefit personally as opposed to the city as a whole, he said.
“They’re called CAVE people — C-A-V-E. It stands for Citizens Against Virtually Everything,” James said. “Dealing with skeptics and CAVE people was always difficult.”
He said coalition building was integral to advancing initiatives in Kansas City, including a commitment to demolish the old Kansas City International Airport’s three-terminal complex and build a single-terminal airport. The same could be said for developing a streetcar line or launching North America’s first technology-enabled “Smart City.”
“You want kids to come back home? You got to be willing to give them some stuff to come home to,” James said. “More technology. A little bit more open. It’s a little bit more edge.”
James, 73, works in consulting with Joni Wickham, a former chief of staff in the mayor’s office. She moderated the conversation with James at the nonpartisan Dole Institute on the University of Kansas campus.
 
Two-Scotch rule
James said he appreciated the value of social media as a vehicle for sharing information when he joined City Hall. He learned to abide by a self-imposed rule for posting to X, which was known as Twitter.
“I was banned from tweeting after two Scotches,” James said. “Media has a place, and the problem is that that place is being abused. Frankly, it just becomes mob thinking. It’s totally out of control.”
James said people who withdrew from the chaos of American politics ran the risk of empowering people “who think it’s not messy enough.”
He urged anyone drawn to electoral politics to first seek public office at a local level. That’s the place to learn how problems created at the federal and state levels flow to local government, he said.
“When you get to the upper levels, it all becomes whether you’re Democrat or Republican,” he said. “That’s not what public service is. We have a lot of politicians acting in the service of themselves and their party.”
In terms of public safety, James said he wouldn’t have welcomed a U.S. president’s deployment of National Guard troops to Kansas City without clearly articulated conditions put down in writing.
National Guard units that were assigned crimefighting roles would need to be supervised by local law enforcement officers who understood state laws and municipal ordinances, he said. Anyone who federal troops placed in a city jail wouldn’t have been eligible for transfer without legal due process, he said.
President Donald Trump dispatched National Guard personnel to Washington, D.C., in a purported effort to cut crime, but some of those soldiers were observed picking up trash and doing landscaping work.
“This is a publicity stunt. It’s a high-profile distraction. It’s also a way to infiltrate ICE into your community in a way that you can’t really avoid so they can do whatever nasty crap they want to,” James said.
 
Playing ball
James said he understood the argument for possibly drawing on tax dollars for new stadiums for the Kansas City Royals or Kansas City Chiefs. He said Arrowhead Stadium could be renovated, but problems with Kauffman Stadium argued for replacement.
He said there wouldn’t be much debate about taxpayer-supported stadiums if Kansas City was still trying to attract NFL and MLB franchises.
“I grew up in this city when there was no baseball or football,” James said. “It was dead.”
There were highs and lows during eight years as mayor, he said. He regretted a 2019 public vote rejecting a sales tax to finance universal pre-K instruction. And he said there was nothing worse than standing in a crowd of people as a mother disintegrated when told her child had been shot.
The opposite end of the spectrum came in 2017 when voters approved of a $1.5 billion single-terminal Kansas City International Airport.
“Regardless of whether this is good or bad, the work isn’t done. It all works together, so, ‘This is great, but let’s get back to work. This really sucks, like, let’s get back to work.’ If you don’t do that, then you’ll just be bouncing around like a ping-pong ball. And, after four years of that, you’ll be ready for a loony bin,” James said.
 
‘No negativity’
James said his first campaign for mayor of Kansas City came down to a runoff with fellow attorney Mike Burke. He said they had respect for each other and had comparable ideas for moving the city forward.
“There would be no negativity,” James said. “We didn’t run to beat each other. We ran in order to serve our city. And, when you don’t run to try to beat somebody, you don’t have to be a jerk.”
He said part of his mission at City Hall was to convince the public that positive things were possible. He needed that sentiment to restore public interest in investing in economic, educational and social change.
“At that time, Kansas City was a city that never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity,” he said.
He drew from childhood experiences and a career as an attorney and mediator to find consensus in the community.
“I grew up in an all-Black neighborhood. I went to an all-white high school. Every day I was in two different worlds,” he said. “If you can look at the same situation and see both sides of arguments, then you might be able to see a middle point in there where those arguments come together, and you can resolve the issue.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sly-James-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 09:56:28.037134

The stalled budget talks between the House and Senate have left  Michigan schools in uncertain territory with the threat of closures on the horizon.
On Wednesday, members of the Michigan Association of Superintendents and Administrators and the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity met in Lansing to highlight how the continued lack of a budget is harming Michigan schools, forcing them to pursue loans and dig into their savings in the absence of state funding.
Just as members of the Legislature are legally required to complete the state budget by July 1 each year, Michigan school districts must also complete their budgets by July. 
Without a budget from the Legislature, school districts are forced to formulate their budgets based on guesswork, said Tina Kerr, executive director of the Michigan Association of Superintendents and Administrators.
“Lawmakers have obviously missed that deadline. They violated state law, they’ve broken trust with our schools, and most importantly, they’ve put Michigan students in jeopardy,” Kerr said. “Every day that passes without a budget districts are forced into further contingency planning. Instead of focusing on what we should be right now, which is student success, these superintendents and their entire teams are spending time and resources again, trying to guess what the funding will look like.”

Schools cannot operate indefinitely without stable funding, and district leaders are already preparing for the possibility of closures if a budget is not put into place, Kerr said. She urged prompt action from the Legislature and the governor to pass a budget.
Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, warned that students who need the most help are the first to lose out, with literacy coaches, bilingual teachers, after school programs and mental health services often serving as the first item on the chopping block when budgets are late.
He pointed to survey data from Michigan School Business Officials, a statewide leadership and management group, which found 11% of districts among those surveyed have laid off teachers, while 15% have laid off non-classroom staff and 42% have made cuts through attrition.
Although wealthier districts can patch the holes left without a budget, low income and rural schools do not have a safety net, Spadafore said.
“Political gridlock cannot be allowed to rob students of stability and opportunity,” Spadafore said. “Every single day the Legislature fails to act is a day children are forced to learn in uncertainty, and that’s unacceptable to me and everyone in this room.”
John VanWagoner, the superintendent of Traverse City Area Public Schools, told reporters that the K-12 budgets presented by the House and Senate are so different, superintendents cannot project what funding they will eventually get.
While Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) previously told schools to hold fast as they work to broker a deal with the Democratic-led Senate, school leaders argue it’s not that simple, given the distance between the two chamber’s proposals and the time it takes to distribute funds to schools, and to secure a loan. 
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

“We’re talking to our newer superintendents saying if you don’t have the cash flow, you need to be applying for your loans now. So even if the money comes as we’re hearing, they still have to have that contingency plan in place,” Kerr said. 
If schools have not taken their contingency plans seriously and payments from the school aid budget do not arrive as expected on Oct. 20, those districts could face closures, Kerr said.
Senate appropriations leader: K-12 funding could be made whole if moved to roads, higher education
In a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) was asked about letters sent to parents of students at Lansing schools, calling on them to contact their legislators and urge them to protect K-12 funding.
A similar letter was sent to parents in Allegan area schools on Monday.
Like Kerr, the districts warned of late school aid payments in October.
Another sticking point in the state budget negotiations is whether to use some K-12 funding for other priorities, much like roads or higher education funding.
Anthony was asked if she could commit to not using those dollars for anything other than K-12 funding.
In response, Anthony said she’s heard from multiple school superintendents on the issue.
“I’ve made it very clear to all of them that I always believed that school aid dollars should compensate education,” Anthony said. “That’s what I believe taxpayers have committed to. That’s what they expect. Does that include higher education? All of that is a part of these negotiations.”
Anthony added that she has been a huge proponent of increasing higher education funding.
“What I can commit to you is that, what we’ve heard from our colleagues in the Senate, is that we want to make sure there are adequate backfills,” she said.
When asked what she meant by backfill, and if that meant some type of revenue to replace school aid funding taken to fund another priority, Anthony said yes.

Glenn Youngkin in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin called federal legislation to allow parents to donate tax-free towards their kids’ schooling — including private schools — a “landmark” moment for education on Wednesday afternoon.
However, public school advocates have opposed the measure, citing concerns about funding diversion, inequity, lack of oversight, and constitutional risks. 
The legislation, known as the Educational Choice for Children Act, makes it easier for parents to send their children to private schools or other non-public options by allowing individuals or businesses to donate money tax-free to organizations that provide scholarships to families. 
Virginia has a similar program known as the Education Improvement Scholarships Tax Credits Program, which provides state tax credits for donations made to approved scholarship foundations. 
According to the Virginia Department of Education, the foundations provide scholarships to eligible students attending certain private schools and non-public pre-kindergarten programs. Approved scholarship foundations make payments directly to eligible schools selected by qualifying parents or legal guardians.
“First of all, this was a landmark moment where a tax incentivized choice program that works incredibly well in the commonwealth of Virginia, and we have a very successful one, translated into a national policy moment,” said Youngkin on Wednesday afternoon at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.
States may choose whether or not to participate in the program. Youngkin, whose term ends soon, said the next governor will need to wait for further guidance to come out before committing Virginia to the initiative. However, he said he would like to see the commonwealth opt in first, saying it is a “hugely” important step.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Opponents, including the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have argued that the “the majority of taxpayers do not support the use of public monies for private education” and that the tax credits could divert essential funding from public schools to private institutions.
During his tenure, Youngkin has tried to provide alternative educational opportunities for Virginia’s K-12 students, including an unsuccessful plan to offer scholarships for students to attend private schools and cover other educational expenses. He also struggled to meet the goal of starting 20 charter schools, with the state constitution requiring state and local approvals. Virginia has a total of seven charter schools.
However, his administration did celebrate the establishment of the state’s 15th lab school — the Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore — during his tenure. 
In 2010, the General Assembly and Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell passed legislation establishing laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools. The schools are developed and operated in partnership with colleges and universities and designed to offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology.
For over a decade, no lab schools were established due to a lack of funding and interest. But in 2022, Youngkin and the General Assembly allocated $100 million to fund their development, with Virginia Commonwealth University opening the first in 2024. Institutions can receive up to $200,000 for one-time costs to design and, if successful, can earn a $1 million start-up grant. 
On the new scholarship tax credits program, Youngkin reiterated Wednesday, “I will not leave office without making sure that Virginia has already agreed to do whatever is necessary for us to fully participate.” 
There is no timetable for when the federal government will provide guidance to states on implementing the legislation but it is likely an issue the state’s next governor will need to address. Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, who was Youngkin’s running mate and is the current lieutenant governor, has been a strong supporter of education options beyond public schools. Her opponent, Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, wants to keep as much public funding in Virginia’s schools as possible.

WILMINGTON — The Saint Mark’s Spartans started their journey to a second consecutive flag football championship with a 19-6 win over Ursuline Academy Wednesday evening.
The Spartans started the scoring with under ten minutes to play in the first half. Sophomore quarterback Madelyn Fausnaugh pitched the ball right to her running back Tanai Tippens just a few yards out of the endzone. Tippens flew down the right sideline evading every defender in her path to put the Spartans ahead.
St. Mark’s added to its lead on its first possession of the second half and scored once more on its ensuing drive with a pair of rushing touchdowns. Ursuline got itself on the scoreboard with a passing touchdown late in the second half.\
Ursuline and St. Mark’s were two of the four inaugural programs (Padua and Delaware Military Academy) to offer girls flag football as a school sport. Last season, the four teams played a three game regular season culminating in a championship game between Padua and St. Mark’s. The Spartans won the game by a three-point margin.
This season the girls will play a seven game regular season. Concord High School, Cape Henlopen High School, William Penn High School and Newark Charter are all fielding teams this fall adding to the first four.
The eight-team pool will battle it out during the regular season for a spot in the semifinals and championship games scheduled for late October.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4181-002.jpg,,,2025-09-11 09:56:28.037134

Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces) received a 2025 Dixon First Amendment Freedom Award in the government category. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government this week announced the winners of its annual government transparency and free expression awards, including two newspaper publishers, a state lawmaker and three other New Mexicans.
The 2025 Dixon First Amendment Freedom Awards Lifetime Achievement winners are the Lang family, who own the Albuquerque Journal; and Kathi Bearden, retired publisher of the Hobbs News-Sun.
“The Dixon Awards celebrate the vital work of citizens across New Mexico who make sure open and transparent government is more than just lip service,” Dixon Awards Committee Chair Daniel Russel said in a statement. “Those being honored are among the best at turning that principle into reality — by exercising the rights we all have — and ensuring everyone has access to their government.”
The Dixon Freedom Award winners in the government category are City of Santa Fe IPRA Manager Katherine Garcia-Gallegos and state Rep. Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces). The media category winners are Cibola Citizen Editor Diego Lopez and Santa Fe New Mexican columnist Milan Simonich.
NMFOG said Garcia-Gallegos in November 2024 “ushered in a new era” at the city’s Records Department by putting all police-recorded crash reports online, easing the department’s workload and giving the public greater access.
Garcia-Gallegos told Source NM that IPRA requests for accident reports accounted for nearly 55% of the city’s total requests in 2024, and over the last few years her team noticed they were receiving multiple requests for the same report.
NMFOG praised Lopez’s dedication to transparency, investigative reporting and ability to explain complex constitutional issues in a December 2024 series about the Cibola County Commission.

The group said Simonich has for decades held politicians in Santa Fe and across New Mexico accountable, spotlighted free speech issues and covered open meetings law.
NMFOG noted Silva, as a freshman lawmaker, passed legislation that would have required lobbyists to disclose bills they were paid to influence and who was paying them, though Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ultimately vetoed the bill. NMFOG also pointed to Silva’s recent effort to protect journalists from being forced to reveal anonymous sources or unpublished information that stalled after passing through two House committees.
Silva is married to journalist Heath Haussamen.
“Knowing who influences our elected officials, having access to public documents and expressing our opinions to shape public life for us and our families: These things are critical in a healthy democracy,” Silva told Source NM via text message.

California Democrats and Republicans alike offered their condolences following the news that Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist and supporter of President Donald Trump, died Wednesday after being shot at a university event in Utah.
Gov. Gavin Newsom — who spoke with Kirk in March on the first episode of his “This is Gavin Newsom” podcast — postponed an event to tout his ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional districts in response to the shooting. In a statement on social media, Newsom said he admired Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate.”

Newsom: “His senseless murder is a reminder of how important it is for all of us, across the political spectrum, to foster genuine discourse on issues that deeply affect us all without resorting to political violence.”

The Democratic-led Assembly held a moment of silence in honor of Kirk before gaveling in Wednesday, while other Democratic officials — including California’s attorney general, legislative leaders and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi — condemned the shooting. 
Both GOP leaders in the Legislature also acknowledged Kirk’s work within the party, with Assemblymember James Gallagher of Chico saying that “no one did more to lead the conservative youth movement,” in the 21st century than Kirk.
As the founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk led the “largest and fastest growing conservative youth activist organization in the country,” according to the nonprofit. A firebrand figure in the country’s culture wars, Kirk drew the ire of Democrats over his views on the COVID-19 pandemic, his staunch support for gun rights and his endorsement of Christian nationalism.
Kirk and his organization often toured college campuses, which were sometimes met with protests from students. In 2023, demonstrators objecting to his appearance at UC Davis clashed with police, though a UC Berkeley event the year before took place without incident.
Kirk’s appearance on Newsom’s podcast surprised many, particularly after the governor broke with the Democratic party by agreeing with Kirk that trangender athletes participating in girls’ sports was “deeply unfair.” 
Newsom underscored his complicated relationship with Kirk in his tribute, adding that the best way to honor Kirk’s memory was to engage in “spirited discourse” rather than violence.

Other Stories You Should Know


Will this bill dent police transparency laws?

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu:
California lawmakers are close to rolling back public access to police misconduct records — just years after expanding it. 
Records of use of force, sexual assault and other misconduct — once difficult to obtain — are now required to be disclosed upon request under laws California adopted in 2018 and 2021. Carve-outs in the state law allows agencies to only redact information that would endanger police officers. 
But under Assembly Bill 1178, authored by Democratic Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco of Downey, when deciding whether to redact records, courts would also have to consider if the officer is working undercover and deserves anonymity because of their duties. 
Supporters argue existing law threatens the safety of undercover agents. But transparency advocates slammed the bill, arguing it risks confusing courts and would allow records to remain hidden simply because of an officer’s role. 

George Parampathu, of ACLU: “This vague notion that an officer’s duty may demand some level of anonymity … doesn’t absolve them of the responsibility over the harm they cause with their misconduct.”

Lawmakers have until Saturday to vote on the measure.



TLDR: Late deals in the Capitol

With the last day of session nearing, let’s dive into some legislative news:

Deal on environmental and energy bills: Through closed-door negotiations, lawmakers struck a multi-pronged deal Wednesday that would extend California’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction program for the next decade; boost in-state crude oil production; replenish the state’s wildfire fund; and advance a handful of bills further regulating utility companies. Read more from CalMatters’ reporters.


Right to unionize: A deal made with ride-hailing companies has sent a bill to Newsom’s desk that would allow Lyft and Uber drivers to unionize. But it also means another measure to enable those companies to pay less in insurance coverage for their drivers would likely advance. Read more from CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.


A YIMBY exception?: Pro-housing advocates notched a win earlier this year after lawmakers approved a measure exempting most urban apartment developments from the state’s landmark environmental review law. But a proposal, introduced Monday night, would make a peculiar exemption from that new policy if passed. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


Delta tunnel: The Legislature has punted a proposal, backed by Newsom, to speed up the contentious Delta Conveyance Project. The massive $20 billion state water project aims to reroute more water from Northern California southward. Lawmakers representing Delta communities say they are relieved that the proposal is dead for now, but experts say Newsom would likely revisit the idea. Read more from CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.




And lastly: A breather for immigrant kids

A U.S. district court judge handed Trump a loss Wednesday, issuing a preliminary injunction that allows states, including California, to continue providing federally-funded public services to immigrants without legal status. The services include benefits such as free preschool for low-income children and shelter for unhoused people. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.

Sept. 10 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceA Macomb County lawmaker has gathered support from both sides of the aisle for her plan to protect people from raw sewage in waterways through a proposed system warning about high levels of E. coli.
Rep. Alicia St. Germaine’s (R-Harrison Township), told the House Natural Resources and Tourism Committee that House Bill 4427 would require counties to issue a “brown alert” if dangerous levels of sewage or E. coli are detected in their waters. 
St. Germaine explained that the bill was prompted by the release of more than a million gallons of raw sewage into the Red Run Drain, a small river which was converted into a drain in the 1920s and 1960s. The drain flows into the Clinton River and out into Lake St. Clair. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Needless to say, it’s a lot of raw sewage, and the residents that live along those waterways never knew,” St. Germain said.
E. coli is a type of bacteria found in human and animal intestines, which the state uses as an indicator of water quality. E. coli in waterways can indicate that water is contaminated with feces. 
While E. coli itself can cause illness including stomach pain and vomiting, the bacteria is also used as an indicator for other types of harmful organisms which cause diarrhea, giardia, hepatitis or cholera.

The county’s drain commissioner, public works commissioner, water resources commissioner or their designee would be responsible for determining if dangerous levels of contamination are detected, and would be required to inform the county’s health department of the hazard as soon as practical, and within 12 hours of their determination.
Under a substitute version of the bill adopted by the committee, the County’s health department would also be responsible for issuing an alert to residents as soon as possible, with requirements to issue the alert within 12 hours.
The alert would be sent directly to residents’ phones and would list the location of the contamination and the health risks of exposure. 
The bill was also crafted with input from Macomb County Public Works Commissioner and former GOP state Rep. Candice Miller, St. Germaine told committee members. 
The committee did not take a vote to refer the bill to the House floor for further action, however, committee chair David Martin (R-Davison) said work was being done to refine the policy, and that there was more to come.

,California,2025-09-11 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Google wasn’t against this privacy bill, officially. Behind the scenes, it orchestrated opposition",Khari Johnson and Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/google-lobbying/,Google organized business owners against California legislation to force its Chrome web browser to safeguard personal data.,"In summary
Google organized business owners against California legislation to force its Chrome web browser to safeguard personal data.


In April, Rhode Island resident Navah Hopkins received a plea for her help to defeat  legislation thousands of miles away in California.
The ask came from Google, maker of the world’s most used web browser, Chrome. The tech giant sent a message to an email list that Hopkins and other small business owners were subscribed to. Google’s request: To sign a petition opposing Assembly Bill 566, which would require browsers to provide users with a way to automatically tell websites not to share their personal information with third parties. The measure is sponsored by the California Privacy Protection Agency, which enforces state regulations on such sharing.
In its email to Hopkins, Google claimed that the legislation would “hurt your ability to use online ads to reach customers.” 
“It was intentionally misleading people that by this bill passing, they were going to lose out on all of these tools within Google (to advertise),” she told CalMatters. 
The outreach was particularly noteworthy because Google had not itself taken a public position on the bill. The tech giant was so quiet about its opposition that Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, the author of AB 566, did not know about Google’s email push until a CalMatters reporter asked. Lowenthal also said his office did not receive small business owners’ signatures or outreach.
Google’s name wasn’t on the petition either; instead, the document was officially from the “Connected Commerce Council,” which the tech giant backs financially.
The largely behind-the-scenes campaign offers a glimpse into how the tech giant is working to preserve its grip on the online advertising market and how it attempts, without being seen, to shape policies in a state with one of the nation’s strictest privacy protection laws.
Recruiting small businesses to represent the policy interests of a tech giant isn’t new. Last year, Google successfully blocked a similar bill — ultimately vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom — by adopting the same tactic, reaching out to small businesses via email lists, according to a message obtained by CalMatters.
There’s no telling how effective Google’s lobbying on the measure has been this year, or how many people it successfully mobilized. Experts warn that the strategy could backfire if the people it reaches out to, like the small business owners, aren’t buying what the company is selling. 
But before the browser bill reached its final floor vote, Lowenthal amended it to delay the effective date until 2027 and to add liability protections for browser companies like Google. 
When asked who advocated for that language, Lowenthal said he’d taken input from “colleagues and stakeholders” to shape up the “strongest possible bill.” 
“With any bill that’s been vetoed before, it takes some give-and-take to get it across the finish line,” he said.
Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Google ranked among the most active lobbyists in California last year, spending more to influence the opinions of elected officials than it had in the previous 20 years combined. The lobbying was aimed at battling AI regulation, local news funding requirements, and a prior version of the browser bill. 
This year, it has disclosed pouring nearly $700,000 into lobbying state leaders on bills including AB 566. Google has also increased lobbying spending in many other statehouses, according to the Open Markets Institute. With inaction in Congress, states have led the way in tech regulation in recent years.

But it’s hard to trace Google’s full influence when the company does not publicly share its position on bills like AB 566, instead paying groups like the California Chamber of Commerce and Connected Commerce Council to influence legislators on its behalf.
Google registered to lobby 17 bills this year that sought to do things like place warning labels on social media or protect people from algorithms that make health care decisions, but the company only publicly stated its position on one bill that sought to require online age verification, according to state filings and Digital Democracy.
Google’s lobbying tactics, while not illegal, demonstrate the sway money has over policies, said Sean McMorris, the transparency, ethics, and accountability program manager at California Common Cause.
“This type of activity … exemplifies the skewed playing field that we have to play on,” he said. “It’s important to report on and to point out these strategies and loopholes that money can afford you the privilege to engage in, and the public has every right to scrutinize whether that is just or not.”
If Google really believes this bill shouldn’t become a law, its lobbyists should show up to testify at a public hearing, not behave in shadowy ways that undercut democracy, said Brandon Forester, an organizer for MediaJustice, a nonprofit that has been critical of the influence of of Big Tech companies and internet service providers.
“None of us wants to enter a surveillance marketplace every time that we go on the internet,” he said. “​Part of the reason they need to do the shadow lobbying is because the things that they want to do to achieve their infinite growth model is not good for the public.”
AB 566 is not the only threat Google faces to its grip on how people surf the web. A judge ruled last month that the company may no longer enter into exclusive distribution deals for Chrome or Google search. And Chrome faces new competition from a number of AI-powered browsers entering the market, reportedly to soon include one from ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
Onerous mandate or consumer convenience?
Under a 2018 state law, California businesses must provide customers with a way to forbid the sharing or sale of their personal information to businesses. AB 566 seeks to streamline that process. 
Browsers such as DuckDuckGo, Brave, and Firefox already have privacy features that, once enabled, automatically send an opt-out signal to each website the user goes to. 
The California Chamber of Commerce opposes AB 566, arguing it represents an onerous mandate. The measure lacks clarity, regulates browsers that aren’t “consumer-facing” and is hard to implement, the trade association argued in a letter to lawmakers.
“Browsers and devices already compete to offer clear, effective privacy controls,” Ronak Dalami, a lobbyist for the chamber, told lawmakers in July. 
A similar bill the Legislature passed last year would have required both web browsers and mobile operating systems to offer ways to automatically prohibit the sharing of a user’s personal information, but Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill because no major mobile operating system includes such an option.
“To ensure the ongoing usability of mobile devices, it’s best if design questions are first addressed by developers, rather than by regulators,” Newsom said in a veto message.
Bianca Blomquist, California director of nonprofit Small Business Majority, which represents 85,000 small businesses nationwide, was among the business owners who received an email last year from Google, on a mailing list of businesses that participated in the company’s training program, Grow with Google. The letter argued that allowing people to easily stop companies from sharing their personal information would make it more expensive for small businesses to sell their products. 
But Blomquist was skeptical. And while Newsom’s veto message spoke of design risks, she said that most people she talks to “are more concerned about their data being shared than they are too many buttons flashing on a screen.” 
To Blomquist, the email is clear evidence that Google was “leveraging” the data it collected from partners for advocacy. 
“What we find is that small business owners … and partner organizations oftentimes sign on to support or oppose legislation without having an understanding of what it does.”
Connected Commerce Council
The petition Google circulated this year was authored by Connected Commerce Council, or 3C, a lobbying group that in 2022 claimed to represent 15,000 small businesses but lists Google and Amazon as funders and partners. In 2022, Google and Amazon mobilized their users to fight anti-trust bills in Congress by encouraging them to sign a model online petition the council drafted. That year, the nonprofit published and later removed a membership directory of 5,000 small businesses, many of which told Politico they were not members of the organization. 
This spring, the group sent a letter to California state lawmakers, arguing that the requirements proposed in AB 566 would cause small businesses to lose out on customer data and make their websites more expensive to operate. 
“Implementing a sweeping experiment that would jeopardize small businesses’ success, limit Californians’ access to relevant products and services, and potentially disrupt access to free web content, is not a sensible way forward,” wrote Rob Retzlaff, executive director of the group.
In a virtual press conference last month, the organization put forward two California online business owners who oppose the legislation. The owners argued that the browser feature mandated in the bill could inadvertently drive away customers, would block them from sending targeted ads to users who opt out of having their personal information shared, and would make it impossible for customers who opted out to opt back in.
“If they opt out of one thing — maybe they just didn’t want … my weekly emails about moms connecting, but they want to have discounts — how are we going to segment that?” said Michelle Mak, owner of baby product store Mewl Baby.
Google did not report paying the commerce council any money to lobby on its behalf to the California secretary of state. But Google reported paying the California Chamber of Commerce, the face of its opposition, almost $100,000 to lobby this year. It also reported paying TechNet, which also registered its opposition, $2,500. 
Connected Commerce Council spokesperson Jennifer Hodgkins declined to answer a list of questions from CalMatters, instead providing a statement pointing to the organization’s letters to the Legislature, press releases and statements from small business owners featured in its press conference.
“Small business owners are deeply concerned about the impact AB 566 will have on their ability to advertise online, find new customers, and grow,” Hodgkins said. 
John Myers, a spokesperson for the California Chamber of Commerce, declined to answer a CalMatters question about the payments it received from Google.
But McMorris of Common Cause said Google’s payments to the chamber for lobbying should be “closely scrutinized.” 
“If it’s not for (AB566), then what was it for?” he said. “That’s where the law gets murky, and you have these wink and nod relationships where both sides know how to play the game without explicitly saying, ‘This is how we are going to play the game.’”
Mobilizing users a unique tactic
It tracks that Google turned to small business owners to protect the company’s business model, said Jeremy Mack, director of the Phoenix Project, a group that tries to draw attention to San Francisco Bay Area front organizations secretly funded by tech billionaires.
Mack said the practice is reminiscent of how Uber and Lyft mobilized people who use ride-hailing apps to fight Proposition 22 and keep gig workers from being defined as employees instead of contractors, and tactics embraced by apartment landlords and realtor groups.
“It’s not surprising that Google would do this, but it’s definitely good to be able to flag this for people and put it on their radar,” he said.
Unlike other industries seeking to influence policy, tech companies can mobilize users through their online platforms, said Austin Ahlman, a researcher who tracks Google lobbying efforts in state capitals for the Open Markets Institute. It’s part of a long pattern of tech companies using small businesses that rely on their platforms to preempt regulation.
Meta also has a history of recruiting small businesses to represent its interests, and Google and Meta threatened or prevented people in Australia, Canada, and California from seeing the news to oppose a demand that the companies pay to link to news websites. An earlier, prominent instance of tech companies using their platforms to influence legislation came around the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act when major companies, including Google, organized to shut down their websites for a day in September 2012 to oppose those laws.
“Frankly, it mostly works.”Jeremy Mack, director, Phoenix Project, on tech companies mobilizing their users against regulation
Mack thinks mobilizing users has been devastatingly effective, but companies probably do it sparingly because if they do it too often people will be more aware of how much  control large tech companies have over people’s information.
“I’d call it anti-democratic, but I wouldn’t call it desperate, because, frankly, it mostly works,” he said.
Powerful companies typically combine traditional lobbying and strategies used by civil society organizations when regulatory pressures threaten their core business model, according to a 2023 research paper about corporate lobbying campaigns. Those tactics were  historically associated with the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, but tech companies have innovated on and rejuvenated the lobbying form. They can do so more effectively because they can tap into user data and their platforms give them unmediated communication with customers.
Companies typically recruit users to advance their policy initiatives when they sense a threat to their business and no longer believe conventional lobbying will be sufficient, said UCLA sociology professor Edward Walker, who studies how companies mobilize customers to speak out about legislation.
But it only works if users are motivated to speak out, such as when video game players fought efforts to regulate in-game violence, or when for-profit college students opposed a push by the Obama administration to keep them from receiving federal student aid.
“It’s important to know that these kinds of grassroots lobbying strategies, or user mobilization strategies, are a double-edged sword. It’s not a given that they’re always going to work in your favor,” he said. “If you do this in a scattershot way, you really increase the risk it’s going to backfire on you.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s yearslong redistricting lawsuit is back before the Utah Supreme Court as the Utah Legislature’s attorneys continue to fight a lower court ruling that tossed out the state’s 2021 congressional boundaries. 
Legislative attorneys argue the tight timeline the court has laid out to select a new map before Nov. 10, in time for the 2026 election, has only heightened “the separation-of-powers harms to the Legislature” and doesn’t wholly abide by the 2018, anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that the judge has now deemed law. 
The lawsuit’s plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and several Salt Lake County voters — had a fiery response to those arguments in their rebuttal submitted to the Utah Supreme Court late Tuesday. 
Utah Supreme Court will consider lawmakers’ appeal against drawing new congressional map

“It is difficult to avoid the jarring irony running throughout Legislative Defendants’ petition — that now, more than five years after defying the will of the voters and gutting every meaningful part of Proposition 4, it is the Legislature that wants to be its newfound champion, claiming Utah voters must abide yet another election cycle under an unlawful map because there just isn’t enough time to pay adequate fidelity to Proposition 4,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. 
They argued that the Legislature claims it now needs to be rescued “from an ‘emergency’ that is self-created at best and wholly illusory at worst.” 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson, they argued, has “put in place an orderly process, similar to what courts across the country have used in analogous circumstances.” 
“That process will (finally) result in a legal and constitutional map being in place for the 2026 election cycle,” they wrote. “There is no ‘emergency’ simply because the Legislature does not want to do the work voters demanded and that it should have done five years ago. The petition, which is heavy on rhetoric and light on analysis, should be denied.”

Gibson ruled on Aug. 25 that the 2021 map was the product of an unconstitutional process after the Utah Legislature repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative, Proposition 4, which created an independent redistricting commission. By passing SB200, the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature turned that commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore — which is what they did when they drew the 2021 congressional map that anti-gerrymandering groups have called “blatant gerrymandering.” 
Legislative attorneys are now appealing to the same court that handed them a major blow last summer, when all five justices on the Utah Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion that Gibson — who had previously dismissed the claim that the Legislature violated the Utah Constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative — had erred. 
On Saturday, the Utah Supreme Court granted Utah lawmakers’ emergency request for an expedited review of their petition to block Gibson’s ruling, which asked the court to grant or deny their motion no later than Sept. 15 given the tight timeline the Utah Legislature now faces to draw a new map by Sept. 25. 
Gibson amends ruling, says she ‘overstepped’ by ordering lawmakers to draw a new map
As the case rapidly winds through the Utah Supreme Court, Gibson also filed an amendment Saturday clarifying her Aug. 25 ruling while also officially adopting the timeline parties previously agreed to setting deadlines for the new map-drawing process. 
While Gibson’s ruling continues to block Utah’s 2021 congressional map, Gibson amended it to “remove the ‘order’ requiring the Legislature to ‘design and enact’ a new congressional plan in the next 30 days.”
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

“That ‘order’ failed to recognize the separation of powers between our courts and our legislature and unintentionally failed to respect the Legislature’s authority to determine how to address the Court’s order enjoining H.B. 2004,” Gibson wrote. “This Court overstepped its authority by ordering the Legislature to enact a new congressional plan.”
However, that doesn’t change the timeline that has been set to remedy the tossed-out 2021 congressional map, which Gibson deemed a product of an unconstitutional process. 
While her ruling allows the Legislature to decide whether to submit a map or not, the court still retains jurisdiction over selecting a new map to be used in the 2026 election — whether it’s submitted by lawmakers or by the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. 
Here’s the schedule attorneys for the Utah Legislature and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs have agreed to abide to and Gibson’s latest order has affirmed:

Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office.

The goal of a bill proposed by Assembly Democrat Buffy Wicks is to seed solar farms on fallowed fields.,"In summary
The state’s farmers are divided over a bill that would loosen rules protecting agricultural land. The goal of a bill proposed by Assembly Democrat Buffy Wicks is to seed solar farms on fallowed fields.



Ross Franson stood on the road between two fields, where nothing grows under the Fresno County sun. 
As a teen, Franson hauled a water tank to spray down the dust on roads like this — rolling past rows of almond and pistachio trees, the CD on his Discman skipping with every bump. 
A quarter of a century later, with water supplies squeezed by climate change and regulation, the dust has spread beyond the sunbaked track to barren fields. Now, on one side of the road, a field sits empty — fallowed, tire-tracked and dry. On the other stands a new crop: solar panels, in glassy black rows behind a chain-link fence. 
“We’re farmers. We’d rather farm,” Franson said. Still, he added, “This is the only way I think people are going to survive out here, if they’re able to find out other uses for some of the ground like this.” 
The valley that was once a refuge for people fleeing the Dust Bowl is facing its own reckoning with dust and water scarcity. And it has prompted scientists and policy experts to wonder what to do with land left behind. Why not solar? they ask.
It’s an existential question for the most agriculturally productive state in the nation. Now, California lawmakers are wading in, with a bill that aims to clear away a financial hurdle for energy developers and landowners eager to plant solar farms with battery storage on fallowed fields. 
Authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, the bill tackles the Williamson Act, 60-year-old law designed to fend off the creep of suburbia. 
Under the law, farmers and ranchers can enter into 10- or 20-year agreements with local governments to keep their land in farming. In exchange, they receive cuts in their property tax assessments that can range from 20% to 75%. But cancelling the contract before the term ends incurs fees that can reach millions of dollars. 
Wicks’ bill would allow farmers and ranchers to suspend their Williamson Act contracts if they plant solar and storage on water-stressed farmland. Property taxes would go back up, but they would avoid the cancellation fees. 
“In general, I think that this is probably a good way to help grease the wheels for more solar development,” said Andrew Ayres, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno and an author of a 2022 report on solar and groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley. 
But there are so many opposing forces pushing and pulling at efforts to develop renewable energy, Ayres said, “All of these things do come along with caveats and tradeoffs.”
Fallow fields, energy opportunities
California’s ambitious climate laws call for the state’s grid to run entirely on renewable energy by 2045. 
Hitting that target will require hundreds of thousands of acres of new solar generation near communities that need it, with enough transmission and battery storage that the electricity doesn’t go to waste. 
The question is where to put the panels. Solar farms on public lands with valuable wildlife habitats and ecosystems are deeply controversial. 
“‘Put it on agriculture!’ is one of the solutions to that,” said Dustin Mulvaney, a Professor of Environmental Studies at San José State University. “California needs a lot more solar, and it needs solar closer to its population centers.” 
The Central Valley — California’s agricultural heartland — is in a prime location, Mulvaney said. 
Already, about half of the almost 100,000 acres of large-scale solar developed in California is in the San Joaquin Valley, California Energy Commission staff told CalMatters based on their analysis of a federal database. 
The San Joaquin Valley is also at the heart of California’s water crises. The state’s landmark groundwater law, enacted more than 10 years ago after thousands of wells in the valley went dry during drought, is now tightening its grip on growers pumping from some of California’s most critically overdrawn aquifers. 
With no new water supplies, up to 900,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley could go out of production over the next 15 years, according to estimates from the Public Policy Institute of California. 
“An uncomfortable truth California must reckon with is that we are facing a significant lack of access to water across many of our rural counties,” Wicks said at a Senate hearing in July. “Whether this bill passes or not, up to one million acres of farmland is soon going to be fallowed.” Wicks’ office did not respond to a request for an interview.

About half of California’s 30 million acres of farm and ranchland is covered by Williamson Act contracts. Renewable advocates say it’s a no-brainer to seed solar farms onto fallowed ground, and the proposal has precedent. 
In 2011, California lawmakers enabled landowners to cancel Williamson Act agreements in order to use their land for solar energy projects, as long as the soil was already in poor condition. 
Wicks’ bill would expand this little-used provision to allow landowners to suspend Williamson Act contracts on land facing water scarcity, and to include solar energy storage and other related facilities as well. 
“I can’t find a downside here, and that’s why it’s always fascinating to me when I hear people saying, ‘Well, solar is going to cause a loss of farmland.’ It’s mind boggling,” said Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-Scale Solar Association. “If folks are concerned about solar occupying those fallowed lands, what are they saying they’d prefer?” 
Even if Williamson Act penalties are cleared away, other roadblocks remain, Ayres said. 
There are permitting lags and supply chain slowdowns and bottlenecks in transmission that can stop solar energy from reaching population centers. The Trump administration has upended tax credits for renewable energy projects. And the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant Fire is stoking local concerns about building battery storage facilities near homes. 
For some projects, the Williamson Act “could be a very significant impediment,” Ayres said. “For other projects, it could be minimal.” 
Farmers, divided
Whether to further loosen state policies protecting open farmland is a question dividing the farming industry. 
By the end of August, big-spending labor interests had aligned with solar companies, the Kern County Farm Bureau, the Almond Alliance, wine grape growers and others in support. They say that if farmers can’t readily plant solar panels, all they’ll grow is dust. 
Franson’s company, Woolf Farming and Processing, farms 20,000 acres near the Fresno County town of Huron. Water shortages, he said, have forced the company to fallow about a quarter of that land — sometimes more.

Leasing some to a solar developer helps offset the costs of holding onto it, and allowed him to consolidate limited water supplies for fields still growing crops.  
“I got three little kids that I would hope would want to be involved in the family business of farming,” Franson said. “This is basically the only way they’re going to have any kind of chance of that.” 
On the other side are the California Farm Bureau, organic and family farm organizations, and other farmland conservation groups listed in opposition at the end of August. They are far outgunned and outspent by supporters, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy. 
Opponents warn that pulling at the threads of the Williamson Act’s protections could fray the fabric of farming regions, unraveling the economies of scale that help agriculture to operate efficiently. They want to see the definition of water-stressed farmland narrowed, and the bill scaled back to only the driest parts of the state.  
“If you start taking …  agriculture out of an area, you don’t have to remove all of it for agriculture in that place to die,” said Peter Ansel, the California Farm Bureau’s director of policy advocacy. “The trucks that come to pick up produce from fields, the contract laborers that come to bring people to the fields — all of that requires your neighbors still farming.” 
He points to Imperial County, which does not have an active Williamson Act program, as a glimpse of the future. In July, the powerful Imperial Irrigation District board condemned siting solar farms on active farmland, which they said have already consumed 13,000 acres — “providing little to no benefit for local communities.” 
Ryan Jacobsen, chief executive of the Fresno County Farm Bureau, said undermining the Williamson Actis a slippery slope. 
“You’re doing it for solar — why aren’t you doing it for affordable housing?” Jacobsen asked. “You’re doing it for housing; why aren’t you doing it for a racetrack facility? I mean, it just goes (on). Where do you stop?”
Leaping ahead, or leaving farm towns behind 
Whether Wicks’ bill passes or fails, it exposes fears about losing farmland in regions long dependent on agriculture to drive employment and local economies. And it raises concerns that farmworker communities already burdened by poverty and pollution will face new threats from whatever industry takes its place. 
María Dolores Díaz, a widowed grandmother who lives in the tiny town of Cantua Creek, once worked in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley — even while pregnant, even with her children beside her. She can still picture her son’s little hands covered in tape, to protect them while he picked garlic. 
In Spanish, she remembered how she’d warn him. “‘Well, this is how things will go if you don’t study,’” she would say. “But thanks to God, my kids studied. That’s the dream one has, that they have a better job than we do.”
Her son went on to become an engineer, Díaz said proudly, and moved away from Cantua Creek. Still, she wonders what a future with fewer agricultural jobs holds for tiny towns like hers, that are woven into the fabric of farm country.

Even as the Trump administration’s immigration raids and an aging population constrict the agricultural workforce, economists project that land fallowing from water shortages could cost up to 50,000 agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin Valley. 
Gretchen Newsom, a spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Ninth District, said that the union offers apprenticeship programs to help train future electrical workers — including a pilot Spanish language program in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
But Federico Castillo, a project scientist with UC Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, said even with training opportunities, it’s an open question whether there will be enough jobs to fill gaps left by lost agriculture. 
“There is no reason to believe that farmworkers displaced by solar farms have, in any way, shape, or form, the ability — even when trained — to get into the jobs,” he said. 
Wicks’ bill would require renewable energy developers to make community benefits agreements with local governments. Such agreements could include job creation and training programs and funding to benefit workers displaced by water scarcity. 
Environmental justice organizations that work with Díaz’s town and others like it have not taken an official position on the bill, but say they want to see enforceable benefits such as reduced electricity bills that are tailored to the local communities. 
“There is going to need to be some oversight to make sure that happens,” said Michael Claiborne, an attorney with the environmental justice group Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability. “We shouldn’t just leave existing communities that have long histories behind them with no legitimate future.” 
Stuart Woolf, chair of Western Growers — and Ross Franson’s uncle — told CalMatters he’s concerned that piling too many requirements on solar developers undermines bill’s power to help landowners put water-stressed farmland to use. As of the end of August, the association was not listed as supporting the bill, and did not respond to CalMatters’ inquiries. 
“I, for one, am a little anxious that if you try to squeeze too much out of these things, then it’s not really going to accomplish the benefit for the grower that wants to do it,” Woolf said in August.

But Díaz said communities like hers will bear the risk. She worries about battery fires near a town with no fire station. And she fears that the landscape where she owns a home and raised her family will never be the same, not if neighboring landowners decide to participate in massive solar and storage projects planned nearby. 
For her, the orchards around Cantua Creek are part of her town. They’re where she takes walks, and sees her neighbors and their children biking and playing outside.  
“It’s a beautiful thing to be able to walk between the trees. It’s like a garden. We live in an area where there are no parks,” Díaz said. “Where will we walk, what shade will we have, with all the solar panels? … Maybe we’ll have to walk on the edge of the road.”

The first two went to Wallace, Jordan, Ratliff & Brandt, LLC out of Birmingham for $200,000 each.
“The first one is a continuation of representation,” said Clay Crenshaw of the contracts awarded to the first law firm, chief deputy with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, on Thursday.

“And then, over on page 91, we have a conflict situation,” Crenshaw said pertaining to the second contract. “He represents the only defendant in that particular case.”
The third was given to Cappell & Howard, PC in Montgomery, for $200,000. The AG’s Office is representing several corrections officers in that case but sought to contract with a legal firm for the other defendants, citing the experience W. Allen Sheehan, an attorney with the firm, has with the cases.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Committee members approved the contract awards one month after Sen. Tom Butler, R-Madison, requested that a legal contract that totaled $200,000 for Butler Snow LLP be held after Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, expressed concerns about giving a legal contract to William Lunsford, an attorney with the firm who has gotten millions of dollars in DOC contracts over the years. Lunsford was removed from a civil lawsuit after one of his co-counsel, Matthew Reeves, acknowledged using artificial intelligence to create legal filings that were found to contain false citations or citations to nonexistent cases.
England sought information from the Alabama Attorney General’s Office concerning the number of civil lawsuits filed against the ADOC that stems from alleged wrongdoing by corrections officers, the status of the cases and how much money the state has paid to law firms to represent the defendants in those cases.
He wanted to gauge if it would be more cost effective to settle the cases instead of continuing to pay outside counsel to represent the state as the cases continue.
The status of the delayed contract was not clear as of Wednesday afternoon.
The first of the two contracts awarded to Wallace, Jordan, Ratliff & Brandt involves a civil lawsuit filed by the father of Michael Smith, who died in November 2019 while incarcerated at Ventress Correctional Facility located in Clayton.
The lawsuit alleges that Smith was taken by corrections officers to a hallway in the facility after getting into an altercation with another individual over a pack of coffee. According to the complaint, corrections officers struck and beat Williams, who lost consciousness while bleeding from his head, nose and ears. He was eventually transported to a nearby  hospital where he later died.
The second contract is to represent corrections officers and state officials in a lawsuit brought by McArthur Lynch, incarcerated at Ventress, who alleges that a corrections officer had injured someone.
The Cappell Howard contract is to defend DOC in a civil rights lawsuit brought by the mother of Rubyn Murray, who died in Elmore Correctional Facility in July 2023.
The lawsuit alleges that Murray got into an argument with a corrections officer while in a breakfast line. According to the complaint, Murray was pepper-sprayed by the officer, beaten and placed in isolation, where he was beaten further and left in his cell for several hours. Murray was later found unresponsive in the cell and transported to a hospital, where he later died.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Correctional-officer-1024x648.jpg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

Last year’s presidential election saw similar overwhelming majorities in the region for Vice President Kamala Harris — a product of Bay Area politics — over Donald Trump.

John Burton, a long-serving congressman and state legislator who died recently at age 92, personified the Bay Area’s history of Democratic hegemony.
The political organization he, his late brother, Phil Burton, and former Assembly Speaker and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown founded in the 1950s remains — at least as long as the 91-year-old Brown remains alive — a very potent player in regional, state and even national politics.
However, Democrats didn’t always dominate Bay Area politics. Until the 1960s, the region had many Republican officeholders and a few remained into the 1980s, particularly in the suburbs.
The Bay Area is not going to change its partisan stripes anytime soon, and probably never. However, an interesting phenomenon is developing in the region — the rise of Democratic political figures who hew to the middle, much to the chagrin of those on the party’s left wing.
Two Democratic mayors, San Francisco’s Daniel Lurie and San Jose’s Matt Mahan, personify the drift, and an atmospheric change in San Francisco’s governing Board of Supervisors, long a bastion of progressive politics, is another indication.
Lurie, elected last year, comes from personal wealth and philanthropic engagement and shuns ideological conflicts while promoting fiscal responsibility and reform of his city’s notoriously restrictive regulatory processes.
His most recent effort is what he calls PermitSF, a package of  “six ordinances with common-sense changes for those living, building housing, or operating a business in San Francisco.”
“Today, we are getting rid of the nonsense and focusing on common sense, with a new set of reforms that will make it easier for San Franciscans to live, grow, and invest in this city,” Lurie said as he revealed the package.
Progressives on the city’s governing board may resist Lurie’s actions but, as a recent  San Francisco analysis of voting records points out, “For the first time since 2019, the city’s left-leaning supervisors are outnumbered by a more centrist group that not only has more seats but also consistently votes together.”
Meanwhile, Mahan, who had careers in philanthropy and high technology before running for mayor in 2022, is also a non-doctrinaire Democrat. He broke with the party by endorsing Proposition 36, a 2024 ballot measure to crack down on crime, and recently published an article sharply criticizing Newsom for ignoring the state’s bad business climate.
Mahan said “the governor, and every elected official and leader, also need to own up to the truth. And the truth is that California has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 5.5%, and nearly half the nation’s unsheltered homeless people. We have the highest energy and housing costs in the continental United States, and, largely because of these high costs, the highest effective poverty rate in the nation.”
When one political party becomes dominant, it often fragments into factions defined by geography, culture, personality or ideology. What’s happening in the Bay Area exemplifies that pattern.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/101821-San-Francisco-Painted-Ladies-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

Susie Lee, says he is guided by science, a notion that could put him at odds with President Donald Trump’s White House, where some fear science is taking a back […]","Republican congressional candidate and physician Aury Nagy says scientific inquiry reveals the gender “that's hardwired into your brain can be different than the gender that's expressed externally. That's just biology, and I think most people aren't aware of that.” (Nagy campaign video screengrab).Dr. Aury Nagy, a Las Vegas neurosurgeon who is running in the Republican primary for Congressional District 3, a seat currently held by Democrat Rep. Susie Lee, says he is guided by science, a notion that could put him at odds with President Donald Trump’s White House, where some fear science is taking a back seat to politics.
Trump, for instance, rejects the notion of gender ideology. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order recognizing two sexes – male and female – and eliminated  
federal funding for gender-related programs.  “Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself,” the order says. 
Nagy says scientific inquiry reveals the gender “that’s hardwired into your brain can be different than the gender that’s expressed externally. That’s just biology, and I think most people aren’t aware of that.”
Another concern for Nagy is the COVID messenger RNA vaccine deployed during Trump’s first term. Nagy, who served as president of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, asked Gov. Joe Lombardo to ban the vaccine, which he says may be dangerous. 
Trump, on the other hand, is mentioned as a potential Nobel Prize winner for Project Warp Speed, the initiative that delivered the vaccine in record time. 
Philosophical differences aside, Nagy is eager to join Trump in Washington. 
“For at least another two years, we have somebody in the presidency willing to burn down the institutions that have been failing Americans and replace them with something that works,” he said during an interview Tuesday. 
Nagy says CEOs of for-profit health care companies are incentivized to charge as much as possible while delivering minimum care. 
As a legislative observer, he says “it seemed there were lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry and the hospitals, the insurance companies, the hedge funds and the personal injury attorneys practicing medicine, but there was almost nobody representing the patients or the people who take care of them.”  
Last year, he formed the White Coat Party, a group of health care professionals who share his concerns. The group wants “laws that severely punish companies that repeatedly put profits over patients.” 
Under Trump, health care and pharmaceutical corporations are enjoying tax breaks and greater profits. 
‘The way God made them’
Nagy says he has long been aware of research indicating biological differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals can be identified by examining the nucleus of the hypothalamus that corresponds to gender identity. 
He says he once was concerned insurance companies would discriminate against gay people, based on their brain scans. He became more willing to discuss it, he says, when a young man confided that as a teenager “he thought that God hated him because he was gay, and that really impacted me.” 
People, he says, should understand “this is just the way they were born — the way God made them. That is what we have learned through science.” The information, if taught in sex education classes, “could be valuable to the understanding of sexuality.” 
Nagy says he’s enlisted two Southern Nevada hospitals – Sunrise and Mountain View – to assist in “creating a protocol to measure the size of the nucleus, and so we’re hoping by this time next year we can start a study to actively pursue that.”
Gender reassignment therapy should not be allowed until imaging demonstrates the area of the brain associated with gender identity “corresponds to the gender preference expressed by the minor,” says the White Coat Party’s legislative agenda. “Imaging results are not valid until 4 years of age, at which time the size of the nucleus in the brain involved in sexual identity has reached maximum size.”
If elected, he’s hoping to cut through the “racism and bigotry” displayed in Trump’s anti-gay agenda and enlighten the Religious Right, which he suggests may have co-opted Trump, who he notes was previously more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.  
Warp Speed? Not so fast.
Nagy, in the White Coat Party’s legislative agenda, cites research that found fragments of DNA in the Covid vaccines. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the double-helix shaped molecule that carries genetic data that informs the development and reproduction of living things, including viruses. 
“There’s a chance that DNA can jump into your own genome,” Nagy told the Current. A “misfolded” protein, he says, could cause an autoimmune reaction, while a protein that malfunctions could make it more difficult to suppress cancers. 
Nagy says he wrote to Lombardo, “telling him we need to ban the use of this vaccine until we get these questions answered,” but has not heard back. The governor did not respond to a request for comment. 
Nagy’s warning is a reprise of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s earlier call for a ban of the vaccine nationwide. The theory cited by Lapado and repeated by Nagy has been discredited by a variety of authorities as faulty science.  
Nagy says he is unaware of Ladapo’s recent announcement that Florida will end mandates for childhood vaccines. 
“I thought it was just for Covid,” he said, adding he would look into it. 
He supports revisiting the schedule at which childhood vaccines are administered, and says he appreciates Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s willingness to disrupt the status quo, even though Kennedy’s words and acts have “raised some red flags. I don’t think he’s been 100% accurate on everything he said, but I do appreciate the focus that he’s drawn to these issues. I think he’s going to fund science that’s going to help us to find out the truth on these issues.”
Last week, House Republicans rejected Trump’s effort to slash funding for the National Institutes of Health by 40% and voted to keep funding flat. 
Among other initiatives supported by Nagy, some of which place him at odds with Trump’s, are: 

Requiring nurse-to-patient ratios that support patient health and the well-being of nurses. In June, Lombardo vetoed a measure supported by nurse unions that would have imposed ratios; 
Implementing a 2% room tax to help pay for Medicaid, which is expected to be cut under Trump; and
Removing barriers to parents providing healthy meals by marshaling the resources of the hospitality and sports industries, as well as local growers via the Nevada Nutrition Coalition, which Nagy formed in the interest of improving mental and physical health. Meanwhile, Trump cut grants that provide locally grown foods to schools and food banks, and will require states to fund SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). Nevada is anticipating a $19 million SNAP shortfall beginning next year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-10-25-at-3.58 PM-1024x568.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

SNAP has long served as a safeguard against hunger for families who may otherwise face food insecurity."" (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More than 400,000 Nevadans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to help put food on the table. For families across our state, SNAP is not just a federal benefit but a critical stabilizer during periods of fluctuating work hours, seasonal layoffs, or temporary economic hardship. That stability now comes with a new price tag for Nevada. Under H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the state must cover a much larger share of the program’s administrative costs—$19 million in the current biennium, and $25 million every year thereafter. Governor Lombardo and Nevada’s legislative leaders need to take action now to ensure our state is able to continue to fund this critical program.
Beginning October 1, 2026, states will be required to shoulder 75 percent of SNAP’s administrative costs, up from the 50 percent they have historically covered. According to Nevada’s Division of Social Services, this change alone requires $19 million in additional state funding between October 2026 and June 2027. Beyond that window, Nevada must plan for $25 million in recurring annual costs. These are not estimates; they are direct obligations tied to federal law that Nevada will have to meet.
This new mandate arrives at a difficult time. As many as 130,000 Nevadans could lose benefits due to the new eligibility rules included in H.R. 1. That means fewer households receiving SNAP, even as the state assumes greater financial responsibility for administering the program. This paradox puts Nevada in the position of investing more resources into a system that will serve fewer families, underscoring the need for careful fiscal planning and strong administrative oversight.
The impact on Nevada households cannot be overstated. SNAP has long served as a safeguard against hunger for families who may otherwise face food insecurity. Without timely state action, the risk grows that administrative challenges could slow or complicate benefit delivery, leaving families vulnerable during moments of need. A gap in SNAP funding could create cascading consequences, forcing parents to make impossible choices between rent, utilities, and groceries. Such instability does not simply affect individual households—it erodes confidence in public programs and leaves communities less resilient in the face of economic shifts.
That is why budgeting for SNAP’s new administrative costs cannot be delayed or treated as a secondary issue. The Legislature will undoubtedly face many competing priorities in any special session, but this one cannot wait. Ensuring SNAP is properly funded must be on the agenda, and the $19 million needed this biennium must be set aside. Other issues can be debated later—SNAP administration funding is both urgent and unavoidable.
Nevada has always prided itself on prudent budgeting and forward-looking planning. Meeting this new obligation requires the same approach. Lawmakers must commit to funding SNAP administration in any special session, even if other priorities are deferred. Beyond this biennium, Nevada will face $25 million in ongoing annual costs, which means the state must begin long-term planning now to prevent future shortfalls.
For families, the issue is about food security and stability at home. For the state, it is about meeting legal obligations and ensuring government remains responsive and reliable. The mandate is clear: plan now, fund the program, and protect Nevada’s most vulnerable residents.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2230334598-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

(Screenshot, ACCS YouTube)The state’s community college system plans to launch a task force with a goal of improving outcomes for incarcerated people in the system’s educational programs. 
The task force, involving several different government agencies, will focus on working with imprisoned individuals to build skills so they can enter the workforce upon release, Alabama Community College System (ACCS) Chancellor Jimmy Baker said Wednesday, as well work on strategies to reduce recidivism.  
“What we’re trying to do is create a system where all the agencies that in any way impact incarceration or the release [of prisoners] so that when someone has gone to prison, they’ve had some understanding how to improve themselves, but they also have all the skills,” Baker told the ACCS Board of Trustees.

ACCS runs J.F. Ingram Technical College, the state’s only correctional education provider. The college, which  provides training in 19 career fields, as well as GED preparation, adult education and soft skills training for entering the work force, had 3,000 students enrolled in 2023. 
Baker told the board the task force has piqued the interest of legislators and the goal is to help formerly incarcerated people find jobs.
“Our mission, to the extent that it possibly can be, is that if a student or a person is incarcerated, and we know that they are at some point going to be out of confinement, start a process to determine what we can do to provide a training program so they, upon completing their sentence, can have a skill and know that there’s a job,” Baker said to the board.
The chancellor said the focus on cutting recidivism would be “a major coordination of all the efforts between convictions, mental health, Department of Human Resources and education,” he said. 
“Just trying to improve what we’re doing so we can reduce the number of people that return back into the [prisons],” he said.
Baker said in an interview Monday that the task force isn’t focusing on particular facilities or skills, but in the future it will.
“We’ll get to a point where we will probably will and it will be timed with knowing the jobs that are available and the companies who will hire someone who is [formerly incarcerated],” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.50.29-PM-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

Council members voted unanimously on Tuesday to advance a measure that would allow property owners to build and operate “accessory dwelling units.” Washoe County currently has separate regulations on units. 
The final vote is scheduled for Sept. 24.
Original language approved by the planning commission last month sought to also prohibit units from being rented for less than 28 days, but the council Wednesday removed that language and instead intends to work on a separate short term rental ordinance.
States and cities across the country have passed laws regulating or authorizing the building of accessory dwelling units. Some housing policy advocates have sought reform around ADUs as a way to address the affordable housing shortage. 
Reno attempted to bring forward an ordinance on ADUs in 2018, but it failed. In 2024, they began the process of seeking public input on another ordinance. 
After receiving community feedback, initial drafting of an ordinance began earlier this year, said Grace Mackedon, a senior management analyst with the city. 
State lawmakers then passed Assembly Bill 396 in this year’s legislation session, which required the most populous counties and cities that don’t have an ordinance on ADUs to draft one by July 2026.
The legislation would prevent any city ordinance from requiring more than one additional parking space per ADU. Any ordinance couldn’t prohibit separate kitchens facilities from being included in units. 
“Staff then took all of our feedback through this whole process that received any requirements from AB 396, and with that, we modified the ordinance,” Mackedon said. “We created a second draft, and we went back to the planning commission for a formal recommendation. 
The ordinance approved by the planning commission last month
If passed, ADUs couldn’t be taller than a primary residence, must allot one additional parking space and can only be located on lot size of at least 5,000 square feet.
“Staff believes that this 5,000 square foot minimum is a compromise between those that wanted a smaller or no minimum lot size and those that wanted it to stay at 9,000 or even larger,” Mackedon said. 
In a verbal motion, City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr also attempted to add a provision that required written notice of units be mailed to residences within a 500 feet radius. She later deleted the request. 
The ordinance received a significant amount of public comment, including from former state Assemblywoman Sharron Angle. 
Angle said the state legislation was passed too hastily and urged the council to be cautious when adopting its ordinance warning it could create density and traffic problems.
“I’m not against this and I’m not for this either. I’m neutral,” she said.  “You have an opportunity to allow for growth but smart growth. Things that make sense for neighborhoods … Things that could impact neighborhoods negatively can now be stopped right here.”
The council also discussed how ADUs should, or shouldn’t, be regulated as short-term rentals going forward.
“We allow homes to be rented out as” short term rentals, said Duerr. “We allow rooms in homes to be rented out as STRs. We would be only saying, only this one kind of building structure can you not have STR in. I’m nervous about that. Doesn’t seem very fair.”
Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said she wanted the ordinance to include some sort of restriction on short term rentals since the city has yet to pass separate regulations. 
Though she voted in favor of the ordinance, she said she was “a little disappointed” it didn’t include the language with the 28 day limit. 
“I don’t love this outcome,” she said. “But we have to move forward for clarity and so that it becomes something where we are moving into the future.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-10-25-at-1.04 PM-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 08:59:03.247904

It allows the restaurant to be staffed and prepared for larger-than-usual groups.
Well, FIFA has made a reservation for up to 650,000 visitors to Kansas City for the six World Cup matches played at Arrowhead Stadium in 2026.
As ticket sales begin — including four group-stage matches, one round of 32 match and one quarterfinal match hosted in KC — some restaurant leaders are nervous that the area’s hospitality industry isn’t ready for the flood of guests that the World Cup will bring.
“I fear for Kansas City a year from now,” said Jenn Tosatto, beverage director for Penny’s Restaurant Group. “We’ve worked really hard to show that we aren’t just a flyover city and that we have things to offer in our food and beverage scene. But we’re not at our strongest right now.”
Chef Shanita McAfee-Bryant, founder of The Prospect KC, a hospitality workforce development nonprofit, also is worried. She points to the job listing site Indeed, which currently shows more than 6,000 food service job openings, as a cause for concern.
“We have a shortage of 6,000 jobs,” said McAfee-Bryant with the first World Cup match less than a year away. “So how prepared do you think that is? Not prepared at all.”
According to the Mid-America Regional Council, the area’s food service industry employment never fully recovered from COVID. The area is still roughly 1,100 jobs short of the pre-pandemic employment level. Bureau of Labor Statistics data also shows that the larger hospitality and leisure sector in the KC area has shed thousands of jobs each month this year when compared to 2024.
McAfee-Bryant said those numbers mean that if the World Cup started today, Kansas City would be caught short-staffed.
“I know that the city is going to see a surge in demand for hospitality talent,” said McAfee-Bryant. “So what’s the plan to make sure that Kansas Citians reap the benefit of that surge?”
Despite regional cooperation to address transportation, infrastructure, public safety and small-business readiness ahead of the World Cup, there’s currently no formal citywide or regional plan to address a potential boom in demand for hospitality workers.
“I really worry that we’re not going to put our best face forward when the entire world is watching, and that’s scary,” Tosatto said.
 Scale of the World Cup challenge

The World Cup dwarfs every major event Kansas City has hosted.
The 2026 World Cup is expected to be the largest sporting event in history with an expanded field of 48 countries playing 104 matches in 16 host cities sprinkled across North America. Each match captures Super Bowl-level television ratings worldwide.
The White House said that each of the 16 host cities will see an influx of at least 450,000 visitors and a net potential economic impact of $480 million on average.
A spokesman for KC2026, the regional nonprofit group in charge of area World Cup preparations, said that 650,000 visitors are expected across Kansas and Missouri with a projected economic impact of $650 million.
For comparison, the Big 12 Basketball Tournament brings roughly 100,000 ticketholders to downtown for two weeks and generates $23 million to $33.5 million annually.
Using KC2026’s figures, hosting the World Cup is like having nearly seven Big 12 tournaments at once — and it lasts nearly three times as long.
The closest example in Kansas City is the 2023 NFL Draft, which brought an estimated 302,000 visitors to a concentrated area of the city over three days. The World Cup matches are expected to bring more than twice that amount to the region over the tournament’s 39 days.
 Learning from the past

The 2023 NFL Draft was viewed by some in the local restaurant scene as a dud that failed to live up to expectations for their businesses. Some fear that restaurant owners will hear the World Cup hype and dismiss it, anticipating a repeat of the draft experience.
“We were very — very times a thousand — very, disappointed in our city and how the draft was communicated and marketed to our restaurants,” said Trey Meyers, director of marketing and communications with the Missouri Restaurant Association. “They were lied to, and we were very upset, disappointed, and we raised hell about that.”
He said that restaurants and vendors within the draft’s enclosed physical perimeters and immediate surrounding area saw a substantial boost in sales, but that not all the restaurants in the area saw the increased business that they were promised.
“We’re not going to have that same problem with the World Cup,” said Meyers.
Meyers said his trade group, which represents 12,000 restaurants in the region, has been in communication with City Council members, tourism bureaus and the sports commission. A KC2026 spokesman referred questions around hospitality readiness to the Greater Kansas City Chapter of the Missouri Restaurant Association and Meyers. A spokesman for Kansas City, Missouri, did not respond for comment.
 Rising unemployment 

Meyers said a softening labor market may help resolve the staffing issue heading into the World Cup. He has observed staff reductions and an abundance of applications. Anecdotally, he said that one recently opened restaurant in Olathe, Kansas, saw 92 applications for their staff positions.
“I’d say we aren’t in a hospitality worker shortage,” Meyers said. “I’d say quite the opposite.”
He doesn’t dispute the government statistics or Indeed numbers but offers a different perspective. He said that due to high staff turnover rates in the industry, many employers don’t remove job listings because they are always looking for workers. He also said that the restaurant industry may never fully recover from pandemic job losses. He blames recent staff layoffs on a litany of issues including crime, inflation, third-party delivery charges and other increased operating costs.
“We’ve been having a massive staff overage because of all the layoffs from other industries,”  Meyers said. “Everyone defaults to the hospitality industry just to make ends meet and we’ve always seen ourselves as an industry of opportunity.”
The job market here and across the country is beginning to soften. The Kansas City area unemployment rate, which was just 2.5% in May 2022, crept up to 4% in July 2025. In the same month, the number of job seekers outnumbered job listings nationwide for the first time since April 2021.
Restaurateurs who are worried about the World Cup staffing are fretting about the quality, not just the quantity of workers.
“I am getting a huge percentage of applications coming in from people who have never worked in the industry before at all,” Tosatto said. “We don’t just need to get a body in the building, we need someone with skills, ready to go, that can come in and get going. Those people just really aren’t out there right now.”
 Demand for workers will rise no matter what

Regardless of whether area restaurants are over- or understaffed today,  demand for service industry workers will increase ahead of the World Cup.
Missouri passed legislation allowing businesses to serve alcohol nearly 24/7 during the tournament. Extended hours mean extended staffing needs. Further, Kansas City’s population is 506,032, meaning that if projections are correct, more than a second city full of visitors will swarm the area for more than a month.
Meyers said the exact number of visitors can’t really be estimated until we figure out who’s coming to town when the World Cup draws matchups at random in December.
“It really depends on who’s coming here and who we are catering to,” said Meyers. “If we land a group of major soccer nations like England, Brazil, France and the Netherlands, we’re probably looking at close to a million people here over the 40 days.”
 Opportunity meets economic mobility

McAfee-Bryant said the situation may seem intimidating but it also presents an opportunity. She sees the World Cup as Kansas City’s chance to lift vulnerable residents out of poverty permanently.
“This is an opportunity for Kansas City to intentionally build a more diverse hospitality workforce,” she said. “There’s a lot of people who could really use this uptick in commerce and additional funds in their pocket to get on the path towards economic mobility.”
Her organization, The Prospect KC, runs a 16-week training program combining food service skills with wraparound support services to bring people in the urban core out of chronic poverty and into a more stable hospitality career. The nonprofit operates a community kitchen at 750 The Paseo and a coffee shop in Kansas City’s Central Library that offer on-the-job training.
McAfee-Bryant wants to see community-based recruitment in neighborhoods with high unemployment, taking opportunities directly to residents most affected by unemployment and poverty.
“The city has used the World Cup to attract funding for a lot of other things in the city,” said McAfee-Bryant. “So why can’t we use the same World Cup to attract funding and support to help the city strengthen its workforce development pipeline?”
McAfee-Bryant said her organization has limited space and could only train 100 people at a time. She envisions a group of nonprofits, governments, hotels, restaurants, large employers and hiring managers that come together to coordinate a plan to get at least 1,000 workers trained, ready and secure in a new career.
“It’s not something that one organization could take on all alone,” she said. “Everyone is going to have to come to the table to figure it out.”
While larger hotel and restaurant chains can bring in workers from other cities, McAfee-Bryant and Tosatto would like to see local long-term skilled hospitality workers come out of the World Cup.
Mike Burris, the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association’s executive director, tends to agree. He acknowledges World Cup staffing concerns but emphasizes quality over quantity of hospitality jobs going forward.
“I want to make sure that when we put people into the industry that we’re not looking for temporary help, but we’re looking for long-term help,” said Burris. “That’s always been an issue in the restaurant business.”
 KC’s reputation at stake

Boosters say the World Cup represents Kansas City’s chance to cement its status as a destination for more international events. The city has invested heavily in preparations like infrastructure and logistics.
But McAfee-Bryant said if the area doesn’t address the supply of hospitality workers, the World Cup in Kansas City will be like a beautiful wedding that has slow service and gross food.
“Poor hospitality is the thing that will ruin this experience for everybody,” McAfee-Bryant said.
The clock is ticking. Kansas City has less than a year to prepare for the biggest food service industry challenge in its history. The reservation for 650,000 is confirmed.
The world will be watching next summer. Visitors to the area will talk about their experience for years. Their reviews could influence Kansas City’s reputation — and its future as a host city — for decades to come.
“What do you think all the people are going to talk about?” McAfee-Bryant asks.

“This has never happened in our country before. We have had periods of voluntary departure, but not self-deportations under pressure like this,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
In a June report Chishti wrote for the institute, he said the “self-deportation” strategy by the Trump administration is perhaps an acknowledgement that its goal of 1 million deportations a year “might be impossible through immigration enforcement alone, no matter how muscular.”
Immigration arrests fell in August compared with July and have not been close to a stated administration goal of 3,000 a day.
It’s hard to document how many immigrants might be choosing to leave under pressure from the Trump administration. Thousands have shown a new interest in leaving on social media, in court and through a new government app offering a plane ticket and $1,000 for those without legal immigration status. Trump officials have touted a drop in the immigrant population this year as a sign of success, but researchers say fear of responding to surveys may play a role in the data.

A 22-year-old Oklahoma woman, brought to the U.S. as a child, told Stateline she’s leaving for her native Mexico on a flight this month to start a new life.
Living in Mexico may be hard, but the threat of arrest and detention after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed, giving extra funding for immigration enforcement, was too much for her.
“It’s tough. I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known. I speak Spanish, but not the best. My thoughts are in English. I have to readapt to everything,” she said.
“More than anything, I’m tired of being called a criminal here,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, fearing interference with her flight.
“I was in leadership in high school. I was in the marching band. I have a college degree here. I am not a criminal, and this is not OK, what’s happening now,” said the woman, who said her parents brought her at the age of 6 on a tourist visa.
She didn’t qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, because her family took her on trips back to Mexico, she said, returning on new tourist visas.
“I am 22 years old now and undocumented,” she said, “I can’t speak to my parents’ actions. I know there’s issues with legality in that and they made choices that were not favorable. I was a child.”


I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known.

Discussions abound on Reddit, an online chat site, about whether to take a government offer to leave or continue to face the threat of arrest and detention if not deportation.
“After over 20 years of living here illegally (I was brought here as a toddler) I think now is finally the time to throw in the towel. I simply do not belong in the US nor am I wanted here,” one man, who said he was born in Mexico, wrote this month in a chat group for Mexican expatriates.
“I’ve worked in construction a large part of my adult life so I have some money saved up, but no career,” he added. “I just feel tired of not being able to do anything meaningful with my life here. I can’t get a driver’s license. I have no hope of ever retiring when I grow old and I can’t even get a real job.”
The Trump administration is using a “potent combination of carrots and sticks” to encourage immigrants without legal status to leave, according to the Migration Policy Institute report. High-profile arrests at workplaces, homes, court hearings and even citizenship interviews have “generated intense nervousness” while poor conditions in detention centers and the threat of removal to unknown countries create “a palpable fear of arrest,” the report stated.
The Department of Homeland Security has a cellphone app — called CBP Home — that offers a plane ticket and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” wishing to leave. The department told Stateline, in a statement attributed only to a senior official, that “tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app” but did not provide further detail.

Thousands more people have accepted voluntary departure rather than fight immigration court cases and take a chance on arrest and detention. The Pew Research Center found that the overall immigrant population dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million in June, though the change could be due partly to a heightened fear of responding to surveys among immigrants.
In another sign of increased appetite for leaving the country, a social media group helping such people decide has seen soaring membership.
The group, Onward, was started by three DACA recipients who moved abroad during the first Trump administration. It has seen 10,000 join requests this year, more than triple the interest it’s had previously in its four years of existence, said Jason Hong, a founding member. Hong was born in South Korea, brought to the U.S. as a child, grew up in New Jersey, and has opted to live in Spain. There, he is a legal resident and has an opportunity for Spanish citizenship. U.S. citizenship wasn’t an option under DACA.
“If I want to shoot for citizenship here, I can,” Hong said. “For the time being I want to focus on helping others who are making the same decision.”
Another Onward founder, Monsy Hernández, left South Carolina during the first Trump administration in 2017, settling in Germany.
“I was very traumatized with the discrimination I faced in the United States when my mom was put into one of the ICE detention centers. I just wanted to go somewhere where no one knew that I was Mexican,” Hernández said. “I thought, OK, if I’m in Germany, I will be very, very far away from that discrimination.”

Widespread departure of immigrants is almost unprecedented in the U.S. history, Chishti said, though there was a large-scale return of Italian immigrants in the 19th century. They were known in Italy as “ritornati” — a wave of farmers and laborers who arrived here when work was scarce in their home country, then returned home with their savings after a few years, when economic conditions in Italy improved.
More recently, some people from Mexico returned home when work dried up during the 2008 Great Recession.
But the current departures under pressure and threats from the U.S. government seems to be unprecedented, Chishti said. In some cases, parents have been pressured to leave the country or face separation from their children.
Voluntary departure is also an option to settle immigration court cases, and more people are taking that route. In those cases, immigrants must pay their own way and can’t have a conviction for a serious crime. Choosing voluntary departure can get immigrants released from detention and avoid a removal order that could cause them to be permanently barred from returning.
According to federal statistics obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Stateline, 6,118 people were granted voluntary departure between Jan. 20 and July 29, the latest figures available, compared with 2,550 for the same time period last year during the Biden administration. For both years, the majority of cases involved citizens of Mexico returning to Mexico.

Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set the New England region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zack Porter: America’s roadless areas are under attack. Speak up now..","This commentary is by Zack Porter, of Montpelier. Porter is the executive director of Standing Trees, which works to protect and restore forests on New England’s public lands.


Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White mountains, an afternoon fishing on a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank. 
On Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green mountain national forests are at risk.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 
Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green mountain national forests, including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mt. Moosilauke, Mt. Chocorua and the presidential range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were only spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitats and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower 48 states), the agency promoted the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. 
More than 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and wellbeing of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. 
Vermonter Randy Kritkausky, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote, “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree the state must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the past two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. 
In the Green Mountain National Forest, a single project approved in 2019 is set to cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new White Mountain National Forest project proposes nearly 1,000 acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025, which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
The act is an essential step to stopping President Donald Trump’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule. Take a stand today by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. … The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

(Courtesy Will Berry)I was 11 years old in 1997 when Geoffrey West shot and killed my mother, Margaret Parrish Berry, while robbing the Attalla gas station where she worked. Mr. West was sentenced to death for killing my mother. His execution date is set for September 25. But I do not want the state of Alabama to kill him. That won’t bring my mother back; it will only add to the pain I have lived with since the night she was shot. I believe there is a better way.
My mother was the person I loved most in the world. Her absence, and the senseless way she died, has cast a long shadow over my life. Even so, the weeks since I learned that Gov. Ivey set an execution date for Mr. West have been some of the most unsettling I can recall. My dearest wish is to meet with Mr. West. Yet with only weeks left until his execution date, it’s not clear who has the power to make that happen or how to ask them directly.
I was a child when Mr. West took my mother’s life – old enough to understand what had happened but too young to process it. I had no say at the trial, and I’ve had no say since then. No one from the Alabama attorney general’s office called me in April to say they had requested an execution date. No one from the governor’s office called in July when Gov. Ivey set it. If my wife hadn’t stumbled across an article on Facebook, I’m not sure when I would have learned.
I believe in the teachings of Jesus and in His words on the Mount, “For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins” (Matthew 6:14-15). My faith teaches that every trial we endure brings us closer to salvation. It teaches submission to God’s will.
I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God. I don’t want anyone to exact revenge in my name, nor in my mother’s. I believe life without the possibility of parole is just punishment. I believe there is an ending to this story where Mr. West and I find comfort in each other and in the healing power of forgiveness.
I want to tell Mr. West that I forgive him. And I want to ask questions, both about what happened that night and about who he is as a man. In some ways, I suppose I just want to be in a room with him. Through his legal team, Mr. West has agreed to my request. Even in what may be the last weeks of his life, he is willing to spend time with me and reckon with the harm he caused. I believe that speaks well of him, despite the deadly mistake he made the night he killed my mother. I know that she forgives him and that she would want me to sit down with him.










The criminal justice system is not built with victims’ needs, wishes, and well-being in mind. I know that as well as anybody, because what is being done in my name is not what I need or want.


The criminal justice system is not built with victims’ needs, wishes, and well-being in mind. I know that as well as anybody, because what is being done in my name is not what I need or want. I know that clemency is a lot to ask for. But having spoken with a restorative justice specialist who is also in communication with Mr. West, I feel hopeful there could be a future where he and I might sit down together. Where we might pray together.
But time is working against us. Whether or not she can see her way to granting clemency, at the very least I hope Gov. Ivey will grant a reprieve, which she has the authority to do. That time would allow Mr. West, his family, and mine to engage in vital healing conversations. I need time to heal.
I have observed the process around other executions in Alabama. I know the attorney general would welcome me at Holman Prison to watch as Mr. West is killed. I know I would be invited to speak at a press conference afterward. But that is not what I want. When I go to Holman, I want to speak with Mr. West heart to heart. I want to tell him I forgive him, that my mother forgives him, and that God loves him.
My life has been very hard. I hope that Gov. Ivey will see her way to granting me this measure of comfort, and I pray that she will find it in herself to spare Mr. West’s life.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Will-and-Margaret-Berry-for-Sept-9-2025-commentary.jpg,,,2025-09-11 07:56:26.638185

Indiana’s chronic absenteeism rate dropped to 16.7% in the most recent 2024-25 school year — marking the third straight year of improvement.

The rate, which measures students missing at least 10% of school days in a single academic year, is down 1.1 percentage points from last year and more than four points since 2022, when it topped 21%.
“The data is clear. Regular student attendance is vital to ensuring more students master foundational literacy and numeracy skills and graduate high school prepared for their next step,” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said Wednesday. “Statewide chronic absenteeism rates continue to move in the right direction … but we know there is still more to be done.”
The Indiana Code specifically defines chronic absenteeism as missing at least 10% of instructional days in a school year for any reason, regardless of whether it is excused. That’s equal to about 18 absences per school year. Separately, “habitual truancy” is used to define students who miss 10 or more days without any excuse.
Jenner told board members that many chronically absent students are typically absent for more than a month, however.
“It’s not just that they hit the 18 days — it’s much beyond that,” she said.
John Keller, with the Indiana Department of Education, called the attendance numbers “a good sign” but additionally emphasized that “we have more work to do.”
 Broad attendance improvements
Student absences have been on the rise since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indiana and across the nation. Chronic absenteeism surged during the pandemic, nearly doubling to peak at 21.1% in 2022, according to IDOE.
Rates have declined in recent years, though: 21.1% in 2022; 19.2% in 2023; and 17.8% in 2024.
The latest numbers show that during the 2024-25 academic year, chronic absenteeism fell across all grade levels. Nearly 800 schools reported rates under 10% in 2025 — up from fewer than 700 the year before, according to the new data.
But 78 schools still had more than half their students chronically absent, and rates remained highest among high schoolers.
Nearly one in three Indiana seniors — 31.6% — were chronically absent, compared with 23.1% of juniors and 20.6% of sophomores.
Attendance improved across demographics as well. Absenteeism among Black students dropped by 1.6 percentage points, and by 1.2 points among Hispanic students.
The chronic absenteeism rate for students receiving free or reduced-price meals similarly dropped by 1.7 percentage points. The share of English learners considered chronically absent also fell for the third consecutive year, this time down to 17.8%.
“We’re seeing the improvements … crossing all demographics, all types of students,” Keller said.
Story continues below:
2024-2025-Chronic-Absenteeism-Data-1
 
But officials said the academic consequences of ongoing chronic absenteeism remain. Keller warned that for some students, the problem compounds.
“There are some students whose absences can actually be measured in months and years, not just in a single school year, and that becomes a big challenge,” Keller continued.
IDOE’s data showed chronically absent third-graders had a 74% IREAD pass rate in 2025, compared to 89% of their peers who attended more regularly. In English and math proficiency, the gaps were more than 20 points. 
“When you miss a month of school, that’s going to show up somewhere else, and where it’s showing up is in student outcomes,” Keller said. “Outcomes matter and are impacted, at least correlated to attendance.”
Indiana’s attendance laws
A new law, Senate Enrolled Act 482, took effect July 1 to level set attendance definitions in statute and standardize statewide reporting.
Even so, school districts still largely determine where absences fall within three official categories:

Excused absences include illness with a note, funerals, religious observances, college visits, court appearances, and other reasons permitted by district policy. Schools set their own specific policies but must document these absences with appropriate verification, per IDOE guidelines.
Unexcused absences include skipping school, family vacations not approved in advance, or failing to provide documentation for otherwise excusable reasons. These absences count toward truancy thresholds and may trigger attendance interventions.
Exempt absences are those required or protected by state or federal law and do not count against a student’s attendance record. These include jury duty, election service, military obligations, foster care court proceedings, or serving as a legislative page. House Enrolled Act 1660, passed during the 2025 session, further excuses student absences for participation in educational events organized by Future Farmers of America or 4-H.

If a student is expected to miss at least 20 instructional days in a school year due to a medical condition or injury, Indiana law additionally requires the school to provide instruction — but only if a parent submits documentation from a licensed healthcare provider. Schools use that information to develop an educational plan for the student.
What Indiana’s new absenteeism law actually does — and doesn’t do — to attendance policies

If a student has a documented disability, the team responsible for Individualized Education Programs – IEPs — determines how services should be provided during absences.
State statute requires superintendents or attendance officers to report a student who is habitually absent from school to the local prosecuting attorney. Prosecuting attorneys must then notify parents if an affidavit of habitual truancy is filed with their office.
The new law allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken, but they’re not required to do so.
A parent meeting also isn’t required for students with excused absences, and county prosecutors are not notified about a student’s absence if they are excused.
Until July 1, 2026, K-8 students also can’t be expelled “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant.” After that date, however, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.

He credits the format to recurring New York Times feature called “Routine” that asks people how they spend their time. 
I found out I was on lockdown while I was in segregation. I had been expecting to come out of my cell for my hour of rec time, but 10 other prisoners in the segregation wing and I were told that the entire facility was on lockdown and nobody was coming out. We faced a double lockdown because we were already isolated and sectioned off on lockdown status, away from the rest of the population.
I will be off lockdown whenever the administration decides. As of now, they haven’t given us a specific date, and I’m under the impression that this will be a more permanent schedule. 
Family. My family finds out I’m on lockdown when I go more than three days without any communication. They then call the prison and verify my status.
How often. I am usually on lockdown three to five times per month. The lockdowns usually last two to three days. The longest I have been on lockdown (apart from the 2020 COVID-19 year) is three months. This was in 2018 when officer Joseph Gomm died.
Worst part. The worst thing about lockdown is the absence of any opportunity to contact and communicate with my loved ones. I really wish I could call them while I’m locked in my cell.
Entertainment. When I am on lockdown, I like to catch up on my reading, get some extra hours of sleep, and meditate to pass time.
Eating. During lockdown, I get three meals a day. They are almost always cold. A typical meal on lockdown is cold cereal and an English muffin for breakfast; cold pasta salad for lunch; and a halfway thawed-out bologna bag lunch for dinner.
Excercise. If I want to exercise during lockdown, I have to do it in my cell, with the little space that I’m afforded.
Bathing. The only bathing option is to wash up in a small metal sink connected to my toilet.
Emergency. If there were an emergency during lockdown, I would have to hope that a response comes in a timely manner. But more than likely, I would probably write my last words and a will.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-09-11 07:56:26.638185

In Chittenden County, the median sale price of a primary home reached $500,000 last year.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Vermont’s Covid-era home-buying frenzy — marked by an extremely tight supply of available homes and sight-unseen offers — has now eased somewhat.
“I think that the balancing of the marketplace is kind of starting to occur,” said Peter Tucker, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Realtors.
An uptick in real estate listings and home sales show that the market has loosened. Fierce bidding wars are less common than they were just a few years ago, realtors say, and for-sale signs are a more common sight in many neighborhoods. Yet home prices continue to rise.
In 2024, the statewide median sale price for a primary home was about $353,000 — a 9% jump from the prior year. That’s according to state property transfer tax records collected by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, which weeds out seasonal or occasional-use homes.
Preliminary data for the first half of 2025 shows that prices have continued to escalate this year. The median sale price had risen to about $370,000 as of June, according to Maura Collins, VHFA’s executive director.
That metric varies widely across the state. In 2024, the median sale price for a primary home in the state’s poorest and most rural county — Essex — was $200,000. In Chittenden County, Vermont’s population and job center, the median sale price reached $500,000 last year.
During the hot market of the pandemic years, home prices shot up while the number of homes sold plummeted. The rate of home sales now appears to have reversed course. In 2024, 9% more homes were sold than during the year prior, according to the state tax data.
The volume of sales appears to be stabilizing thus far in 2025, though different data sources paint slightly different pictures of the market. The state tax data shows a modest drop in the number of primary home sales during the first half of 2025 versus the first half of 2024. Slightly more current data on all single family home and condo sales collected by the Realtors’ association shows a 2.2% rise in homes sold as of August compared to the same period last year. The number of home listings has also jumped over 8% as of August, according to the Realtors’ association.
It’s still a seller’s market, and inventory remains well below pre-pandemic levels. But now, buyers have more options, said Brian Boardman, a real estate agent and co-owner of Burlington-based Coldwell Banker Hickok and Boardman. 
During the tight Covid years between 2021 and 2023, an agent could show a potential buyer maybe one or two homes within their given price range in Chittenden County, Boardman said. “Now, those buyers have, you know, maybe six or seven choices, or more — and so they can get more of their wish list.” 
A number of factors could be driving more people to sell their homes. Some homeowners may have been waiting for the pandemic to ease before retiring or moving closer to family, said Tucker, from the Realtors’ association. Some may have been waiting for interest rates to lower. The entrance of newly-constructed homes into the market has helped somewhat, said Boardman. 
There’s also a domino effect once inventory starts to open up, Boardman said. 
“The people that are in the family homes for 30 or 40 years are going to go to a retirement home, which opens up their house, which gets the young family out of a rental or maybe a two-bedroom condo,” which they can then put on the market, he said.
So why are home prices continuing to rise steeply even as more homes are selling? Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, sees that as an indication that Vermont needs to continue building more homes to fill its deep deficit. The state is far from reaching a glut that would drag home values down, she said.
“Our goal is not to depress home values, but to slow the ever-increasing sales prices,” said Collins, who serves on the board of the pro-housing lobbying group Let’s Build Homes. “Even with more homes selling in 2024 than 2023 and even with more homes being listed for sale this summer than last summer, we don’t see that home prices are yet lowering,” she said.
Homes are also still selling quickly during the peak summer season, according to real estate data. That’s one sign that demand remains high.
Data on rentals in Vermont tends to be geographically patchy and outdated. But a recent survey of apartments in the state’s largest rental market — Chittenden County — shows that the razor-thin rental vacancy rate of the Covid-era years has begun to ease, according to Brad Minor, a partner at Allen, Brooks & Minor, a real estate appraisal and analytics firm in South Burlington.
As of June, the area’s rental vacancy rate had risen to 3% — up from under 1%, where it had hovered for over a year beginning in December 2021, Minor said. 
That easing is likely tied to the elimination of Covid-era eviction restrictions and rental assistance, but it is also likely the result of new apartments going online, Minor said. In 2024, his firm identified 824 new apartments built in Chittenden County — more than twice the annual rate of building in any given year for the past two decades.
The firm has yet to tabulate how much average rents have changed in the area in 2025, though Minor said that now some landlords of higher-priced rentals with more vacancies are considering making price cuts to attract tenants.
“It’s possible that we may see maybe less dramatic rent increases, because we’re appearing to move towards a state of balance,” he said.

(Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor)It might seem like New Jersey’s controversial ban on guns applies “nearly everywhere that ordinary human action occurs,” as U.S. Circuit Court Judge David J. Porter groused in his dissent of his colleagues’ decision Wednesday to uphold the contested restrictions.
But gun owners with carry permits can take their firearms to a short list of locations — at least until some future judge intervenes in the legal battle that started just after Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law in December 2022. Gun-rights groups have said they will continue fighting to get the restrictions struck down permanently.
So where can gun owners who are licensed to carry take their guns? They can carry in private vehicles and on private property that’s open to the public, such as homes and businesses, with property owners’ permission. They can also carry while hunting and fishing.
The 2022 law makes it a third-degree crime, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to take guns into 25 so-called sensitive spaces. Gun owners cannot carry guns into these places in New Jersey:

Zoos
Parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, and beaches
Youth sporting events
Public libraries and museums
Bars and other places that serve alcohol
Arenas, stadiums, theaters, theme parks, racetracks, and other entertainment facilities
Casinos
Airports, transit hubs, and public transportation
Within 100 feet of public gatherings
Hospitals, outpatient clinics, medical treatment centers, nursing homes, group homes, and health care offices
Schools, day cares, camps, school buses, and colleges and universities
Churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship
Private homes and businesses not open to the public (unless the owner allows it)
Correctional facilities and halfway houses
Shelters for people experiencing homelessness or recovering from domestic violence
Cannabis retailers and dispensaries
Movie sets
Power plants

Guns already were banned in courthouses, polling places, government buildings, and legislative assemblies.
Federal law also forbids guns, even with a permit, at federal courthouses, buildings, prisons, cemeteries, military bases (except for military personnel), post offices, buildings in national parks and forests, and Native American reservations, plus on Amtrak trains and ferries to national monuments.

With the general elections over a year away, current lawmakers started working towards their goal over the summer — endorsing their preferred candidates and working with them to boost their messages and critiques of Republican incumbents. 
But the strategy has ruffled feathers with some announced and potential candidates, who say lawmakers discouraged them from running and are acting as though party “insiders” should be able to determine who represents local communities.
November 2026 will be the first time legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be in effect for the 17 odd-numbered Senate seats up for election. Democrats were able to cut the Republican majority from 22 seats to 18 seats in 2024. They will need to win two additional seats to take the majority in 2026. 
There are three seats on Democrats’ target list: Senate District 5, currently held by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), Senate District 17, currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), and Senate District 22, currently held by Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine). Democrats are also looking to hold Senate District 31, currently represented by Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick). 
After the new state budget was signed in early July, Democrats immediately turned their attention to the elections. Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and other members of the Senate Democratic caucus showed up for a pair of campaign announcements in July. 
Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon) announced her challenge to Marklein, and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) launched her campaign challenging Hutton. The announcements were boosted by the Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee (SSDC), which is the lawmakers’ political arm that works to help Democrats win elections.
“One of the reasons why senators are getting involved with these candidates that are running is because we’ve known them for years,” Hesselbein said, recalling that she first met Jacobson in 2017 while she was serving on the village of Oregon Board of Trustees. “I was really excited about her candidacy.”

Hesselbein told the Examiner in July that the endorsements are not coming from the party.
“It’s senators that know the content of the character of Jenna Jacobson and Robin Vining,” Hesselbein said. “That’s why we’re supporting them. We know that if there’s going to be a primary, there’ll be a primary.”
Hesselbein said she spoke with all of the people who were considering running to let them know what she was thinking. She said it was important to her that people know where she stood, mentioning that when she ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly in 2010, a late endorsement took her by surprise.
“I wish I would have known at the beginning what they were going to do. I’ve always been very extremely honest and forthright with everybody,” Hesselbein said. “They might be upset that I chose a candidate, but they certainly know the reasons why, and we had a conversation about it.”
Senate District 17 
For the last decade, Marklein has represented Senate District 17 — winning three elections easily and serving as the chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee since 2021.  
Lafayette County Democratic Party Chair Nancy Fisker said her community is looking for someone who will represent the values and needs of rural Wisconsin and the task of beating Marklein, who tends to vote along party lines, will be hard. 
“He’s a great politician. He has a really great ground game. He’s been in office long enough that he has people in place who will put him in the right place at the right time,” Fisker said. “He’s very sociable, and people love that.”
Marklein won SD 17 with 60% of the vote in 2022. Under the new maps, however, the district is more competitive. An analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, found the district leaned Democratic by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by over 4 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
Marklein hasn’t announced whether he will run for reelection yet. In July, he reported raising over $69,000. 
Fisker said the new maps have led to renewed excitement around these races. That excitement can be seen, she said, in the number of people who have shown interest in running, which was as many as seven people at one point. 
The first candidate to enter the race was Lisa White, a Potosi businesswoman and grandmother. She said she’s been concerned about cuts to Medicaid by the Trump administration as well as women’s and rural health care in general.
“My determination is to represent the southwestern portion of our state, which has not happened for decades,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “I feel I’m the singular voice in that pool of people who can truly, truly represent the entire district, and not just the Madison area.” 
White also said she wants to see an end to the private school voucher program in Wisconsin.
Corrine Hendrickson, a well-known child care advocate, is also planning to enter the race for the seat and launch her campaign later this month. 
Hendrickson told the Examiner in an interview that the recent budget process pushed her to consider running. The budget’s investment in child care did not meet what many child care advocates, including Hendrickson, said was necessary to help keep them afloat. Hendrickson also recently made the decision to close her own family child care program.
“We’re talking to the representatives. We’re inviting them in. We’re showing them our books… and it’s not enough, and so to me, that means that our representatives truly aren’t listening, and they’re just really moving the goal posts so that they have an excuse not to invest in child care,” Hendrickson said. 
Hendrickson said she was excited when she learned so many people were considering running in the race.
“We’ve had to beg people to run against this man in the past,” Hendrickson said, adding that knowing there were others weighing running made her consider, “Am I the best person? What makes me the best person?” 
“Really, the only way to find that out is to go through the process,” Hendrickson said.
With so many potential candidates, Fisker said county parties across the district decided they would host forums for those considering a run. 
County Democratic parties in Wisconsin usually do not endorse candidates in primaries, Fisker said.
“It’s always been very difficult to get people to run. People just aren’t interested in running for a variety of reasons. So this year we started looking around like we always do, and you know, we had seven people who raised their hand and said, ‘I think I’m interested, but I want to look into it a little further,’” Fisker said. “We were amazed.”
It’s not entirely unheard of for the state party to make endorsements ahead of primaries, especially when an incumbent is running for reelection. During the 2025 primary for the state superintendent, for example, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin endorsed state Superintendent Jill Underly for a second term.
Fisker noted the SSDC has nothing to do with the state party, and she said it was clear early that the sitting senators were planning to endorse a candidate.
“We thought we really had convinced them to wait,” Fisker said. “All it would have taken was them to wait for three or four months. We’re way out here from the election, and you know, the candidates would have self-selected at some point.”
Jacobson, surrounded by five Democratic senators, launched her candidacy the Monday after Gov. Tony Ever signed the new state budget, — just a few days ahead of any county party forums taking place.
Hendrickson said she received a heads up from Hesselbein that she would be endorsing Jacobson and the top Senate Democrat encouraged her to run for the Assembly instead. Hendrickson said she felt the decision for Jacobson to announce alongside the senators just ahead of the forums being held “was a move to pressure us to back up.”
“They’re not voters. They don’t live in this district,” Hendrickson said of the lawmakers. “This district is hungry for a candidate that’s from the area, that understands the deep rural part of this district and how hard we’re all struggling as communities because of the state budget and because of the decisions that Marklein’s making as the co-chair of the JFC.”

Matt Raobin, owner of Brix Cider in Mount Horeb has decided against running for personal reasons, he said, but he described a similar experience in a Facebook post, saying that he reached out to members of the SSDC as he was considering a run.
“In that meeting, it quickly became clear that these are the people who choose the candidate, for better or worse. “We want to avoid a primary,” I heard repeated multiple times,” Raobin wrote, adding that he understood the desire to avoid a primary but also found it problematic. 
“We are in a moment when the Democratic Party needs to reinvent itself. Approval ratings are low. Nationally, we’re taking beating after beating from a Republican trifecta and a hard right Supreme Court. The last thing the Democratic Party should be doing is taking steps to block out new voices from having a chance to be heard,” Raobin wrote. “Avoiding a primary means avoiding the hard work of renewal. It stifles creativity. It squashes out new ideas before they’ve had a chance to grow. It prevents us from testing a candidate’s true viability, and it heavily favors insiders over outsiders.”
The county parties pushed ahead with the forums, giving candidates and potential candidates a chance to introduce themselves to answer questions from the community. 
“I’ve really not seen anything quite like this… we had people from six different counties who came to our forum in Hazel Green,” Fisker said. “It’s been really interesting and fun to see how much people want this… This is what democracy looks like. It should be up to them whether they want to run or not, and then, and then it’s up to us as voters to get out and vote for them in the primary and make our choice.”
White, who is continuing her campaign, said she understands that she is the “underdog” in the race, but thinks it will be worth it no matter the outcome. She said she hopes she is informing people along the way about the issues faced by  the district. 
“There’s no way I can lose if you look at the big picture,” White said. “How can you lose when you are bringing people in… that would have ordinarily tuned out.”
Senate District 5
In the southeast corner of the state, a similar situation has taken shape in Senate District 5. 
The district has been represented by Hutton since 2022 but has changed since the last time he ran. It’s a purple district that represents portions of Milwaukee County, including West Allis and Wauwatosa, and Waukesha County, including Pewaukee, Brookfield and Elm Grove.
Weeks before Vining’s announcement, Brookfield businesswoman Sarah Harrison became the first to enter the race.
Harrison told the Wisconsin Examiner she was encouraged by people in her community to run for the seat — some even reached out to make sure she was still running after Vining’s announcement. She said there is excitement about the race for the 5th Senate District because it appears winnable for Democrats. 
The self-described “data geek” said that as she considered whether to run, she looked at where Democrats had the strongest performances in the past and areas where Democrats could pick up votes and Democrats could grow more in parts of the district that cover Waukesha County. She said her strong “grassroots ties” there would help her connect with voters in areas that have long been represented by Republicans. She said she also brings her experience as a single mom, a business owner and someone who has worked with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 companies.
“I still believe that I’m the best candidate for this seat,” Harrison said. Waukesha County residents, she said, “have been underrepresented for so long.”
Vining currently represents a third of the district in the Assembly. The other two Assembly districts are represented by Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) and Rep. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis).
Hutton hasn’t announced whether he’ll run again. He has raised over $5,600 this year, according to his July 2025 report, and has about $89,770 on hand. Campaign filings from July 2025 showed that Vining had raised about $3,000 from January through June and had about $22,000 on hand. Harrison had raised a little over $2,100. 
Harrison said she felt heard in her initial conversations with the SSDC about running, but that it soon became clear that there wasn’t anything she could do to earn the support of the lawmakers. She said primaries should be about vetting the “best candidates and the best ideas.” 
“We fought to end the gerrymandered maps so that voters could choose their representatives, and I respect that the SSDC wants to have a say,” Harrison said. “I won’t let that stop me from running. I’m a fighter.”
Harrison has run for office, running in 2022 for the Assembly in the seat once held by Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who is now the first Democrat to announce a campaign for governor. She pulled in 43% of the vote in the Republican-leaning seat. 
“It was drawn to be essentially unwinnable,” Harrison said. 
Michalski lost his reelection bid in 2024 to Vining. When Vining made her own pitch for her Senate candidacy in July, she underscored her record of winning competitive races.
In 2024 with new legislative maps in place, Harrison ran for the Assembly again, this time against Rep. Adam Neylon of Pewaukee. She brought in 41% against the incumbent.
“I took on the work and the labor, and I ran two really good campaigns that were beneficial to folks up the ticket, beneficial to the communities. I did all of that at my own cost, in terms of money and time. I had some support from the party, but not a lot.” Harrison said. “To turn around and make this endorsement, it was disappointing.” 
Harrison, who runs a data consulting company, said some of her top issues include ensuring local governments have sufficient funding and that people have access to affordable and accessible child care.
“We’re seeing that folks are hit hard by the need for local referendums because the state has not fully funded a lot of the things they’re requiring,” Harrison said, adding the 2023 law, which updated the way local governments received their shared revenue payment, was just “a toe in the right direction.”
When it comes to health and child care, she said “both of those impact working families and their ability to participate in the economy and to build a better life for their families.” 
She said she would also want the state to accept the Medicaid expansion and work towards “making sure that folks are able to be seen [by a doctor] in a timely manner.” However, she acknowledged the new obstacles that will exist to making those changes under the Trump administration.
“I’m very concerned, especially with some of the changes at the national level that we at the state level are going to have to provide more of a safety net,” Harrison said. 
As she continues her campaign, she has been doing “walk and talks,” getting out in the community to find out what’s on the minds of residents. 
“A lot of people do not want an anointed candidate that was chosen, kind of, by folks who are seen as being insiders. They want to make that choice. They want to have that primary to vet the best candidate. They don’t want a candidate handed to them.”
“It absolutely does make it more challenging for me,” Harrison said of the senators’ involvement. “But it also shows that I’m not someone who’s going to be a yes man. I am going to stand up for what I believe is correct.”

There’s “a longstanding pattern of misconduct by male correctional officers at the WWC,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The post Wyoming Women’s Center inmate sues prison staff, leadership over sexual assault appeared first on WyoFile .","In the last five years, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk have been convicted of sexually assaulting female inmates.
One of those women is now suing in federal court, arguing that the sexual violence she experienced was the result of “deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of inmates” by the prison’s staff and leadership. 
The lawsuit — filed in Wyoming’s U.S. District Court in August — names Joseph Gaul, a former correctional officer, alongside WWC Warden Timothy Lang and Deputy Warden Robert Hardy. Five John Does are also listed as defendants whom the plaintiff could not name but believes were WWC employees. 
In 2023, Gaul admitted to inappropriate sexual contact with the plaintiff, Chasity Jacobs. Soon thereafter, he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and was sentenced to two to five years in prison. 
Before he was hired to work at the Women’s Center in 2019, Gaul was terminated from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit. 
In 2019, while serving as the director of the Scotts Bluff County Detention Center in Nebraska, Gaul was placed on administrative leave and subsequently fired for sending sexually explicit text messages to a female subordinate, the complaint states. 
While the Scottsbluff Star-Herald reported on Gaul’s dismissal at the time, the reason for his termination wasn’t made public after county commissioners met in closed session. 
Before his time at the Nebraska detention center, Gaul was also fired from the Nebraska Health and Human Services for inappropriate interactions with female colleagues and sexually inappropriate comments, according to the lawsuit. 
The Wyoming Department of Corrections is required to conduct background and reference checks before hiring any correctional officer.
But when it came to Gaul’s hiring, the lawsuit alleges “these requirements were either ignored or improperly conducted.”
The Wyoming Department of Corrections declined WyoFile’s request for comment, citing its policy not to comment on pending litigation.

The lawsuit also argues that Gaul’s conduct was not an isolated incident, “but part of a longstanding pattern of misconduct by male correctional officers at the WWC.”
It points to two other former guards who were convicted of sexual assault of an inmate — one in 2020, another earlier this year. 
“The pervasive problem of sexual assault by WWC correctional officers was well known to prison administrators including, specifically, Defendants Lang and Hardy,” according to the lawsuit. “Despite this, Defendant Lang, and other supervisory personnel failed to implement safeguards or address the systematic breakdowns in hiring, training, reporting, or accountability that enabled repeated sexual abuse.” 
Details
Jacobs was arrested on felony charges when she was 19 years old and began serving a 25-to-35-year sentence in Lusk in 2020, according to the lawsuit. 
In 2023, she was segregated from the main prison population and employed as a janitorial worker with restricted movement. It was during this time that she often encountered Gaul in unsupervised areas. 
“Gaul used his position of authority to cultivate familiarity with inmates,” including the plaintiff, according to the lawsuit. “He routinely overshared personal information, including details about his failing marriage, and offered special privileges to select inmates.”
In July 2023, while Jacobs was performing cleaning duties, Gaul isolated her in a chemical closet where he raped her, according to the complaint. 
The plaintiff, “who is substantially smaller than Defendant Gaul, was physically overpowered, frightened, and unable to resist. She froze in fear and was unable to cry out or escape,” the lawsuit states. 
Shortly after the assault, according to the lawsuit, another inmate overheard Gaul ask Jacobs, “Did I cum in you?”
About one week later, Gaul assaulted Jacobs for the second time in a different unsupervised area of the prison. 
Wyoming Department of Corrections internal affairs and the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation began a formal investigation on Aug. 3, 2023, when Gaul was reported. 
Gaul had a duty to protect the plaintiff, the lawsuit states, but he “utterly failed” and his conduct “constitutes excessive force and cruel and unusual punishment in violation” of Jacobs’ constitutional rights. 
Furthermore, Gaul’s violent conduct was part of a pattern, the lawsuit argues. 
“Multiple sexual assaults have been investigated internally by WDOC rather than immediately referred to outside law enforcement, undermining accountability and potentially concealing the full scope of abuse,” the filing states. “Investigations are often incomplete, shielded by internal review procedures, and rarely result in systematic reform or staff discipline beyond the individual perpetrator.” 
The complaint points to Kyle Broberg, a former correctional officer, who was convicted in 2020 of sexually abusing an inmate in secluded areas of the WWC, as well as Kenneth Jensen, a former supervisory correctional officer. 
“Jensen was tasked with overseeing an inmate maintenance crew. While in this supervisory role, Jensen systematically manipulated, groomed, and sexually abused an inmate in September 2024. 
The three recent prosecutions and convictions are likely an undercount, the lawsuit alleges.

Wyoming's largest electric utility, PacifiCorp and its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power, sued state regulators for discounting expenses it wanted to pass on to ratepayers.
The post Court sides with Wyoming utility, rules state should have allowed higher rate increase appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal judge has ruled in favor of PacifiCorp and its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power in a case that could tap the electric utility’s Wyoming customers for yet more money.
For how much is unclear, and one party involved in the case told WyoFile an appeal is under consideration.
The lawsuit, which PacifiCorp launched against the Wyoming Public Service Commission last year, strikes at the heart of a long simmering suspicion among state leaders that the utility giant is trying to shift too much of its rising costs to maintain a regional power system to its Cowboy State customers. 
That’s not necessarily the case, at least when it comes to a particular calculation and modeling tool related to Rocky Mountain Power’s 2023 rate hike, according to an order handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kelly H. Rankin.
As a result of the 2023 rate case, which spurred contentious public meetings, the utility’s Wyoming customers saw a 5.5% general rate hike increase in January 2024, in addition to a pair of temporary upward fuel cost adjustments. Earlier this year, the commission accepted a settlement agreement struck between Rocky Mountain Power and the Wyoming Office of Consumer Advocate to increase rates by about $85.5 million, or 10.2%.

The Oregon company, which is the largest utility operating in Wyoming, named Wyoming Public Service Commissioners Mary Throne (who has since left the commission), Christopher Petrie and Michael Robinson as defendants, according to its complaint. And it gets wonky.
The lawsuit centers on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s authority to require utilities with multistate electric transmission (powerlines) to “hold a certain portion of their energy generating capacity in reserve.” It’s part of a requirement to allow third-party access to interstate transmission lines, and it’s intended to maintain reliable electric service via multiple parties, according to FERC.
That comes at a cost for a utility subject to the federal regulations, according to PacifiCorp. 
To estimate and forecast the cost — the portion that is “just and reasonable” to pass on to ratepayers in a particular state — PacifiCorp and Rocky Mountain Power used an Aurora modeling tool. But the Wyoming Public Service Commission has repeatedly objected to that particular modeling, and reduced how much it allowed the utility to raise its rates in the company’s 2023 rate hike case, based on its objection.
When the commission devalued the utility’s calculation, it unfairly reduced how much PacifiCorp and Rocky Mountain Power was legally allowed to recover, according to this week’s court order.
“Further, it is quite clear from the parties’ filings that the issue regarding trapped costs will continue to rear its head,” Rankin wrote.
Rankin’s order denied a request by the defendants to dismiss, and granted PacifiCorp’s request for a summary judgement, asserting the facts of the case are not in dispute.
The order may be appealed.

EPA's proposed reversal of the “endangerment finding” threatens Wyoming's way of life and economy, writes guest columnist Shana Tarter. 
The post Clean air is essential to Wyoming’s outdoor recreation and tourism industry appeared first on WyoFile .","There are fears I hear over and over from outdoor industry leaders.
“I don’t know how to safely run my business anymore. Each season, the air gets worse, and everything I read makes me worry more about how wildfire smoke harms my staff and participants. What happens to me if I can no longer bring people into the mountains?” 

Opinion

I’ve spent most of my professional life managing risk in the wilderness. For three decades, I trained outdoor leaders to navigate hazards and respond to sudden illness or injury. But in recent years, the conversation has shifted to worries about extreme heat, super-charged weather events, old diseases in new places, and, most crucially, poor air quality. When I present on building climate resilience for the outdoor industry, I’m flooded with variations of the worries above. These are not distant hypotheticals. Wildfire smoke, heat waves and polluted air are already reshaping the outdoor industry. In a recent survey of recreation service providers, 82% reported new impacts from poor air quality compared to just three years ago. 
Many of us grew up after the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970. We take for granted blue skies and breathable air because of its landmark protections. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that greenhouse gases are air pollutants. In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency issued the “endangerment finding,” establishing that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. This finding is the scientific basis for emissions regulations in the U.S. It’s what requires the EPA to protect us from pollution by setting limits on emissions from cars, power plants and industry.
Now, the EPA is proposing to repeal the endangerment finding and eliminate its duty to regulate greenhouse gases. This is a direct attack on public health. It ignores decades of scientific consensus, frees the fossil fuel industry to pollute without accountability, and dismantles critical protections against worsening wildfires, smog and extreme heat.
The evidence that greenhouse gases are bad for us has only grown stronger in recent years. Air pollution has been the number one risk factor for disease worldwide for more than 20 years. In the U.S., oil and gas pollution causes more than 90,000 premature deaths each year and sickens hundreds of thousands more, with communities of color bearing the greatest burden. It contributes to over 10,000 pre-term births annually, 216,000 cases of childhood asthma and more than 1,600 cancer cases every year. Wildfire smoke, a daily stressor for outdoor workers and participants, adds another layer of harm.
For outdoor programs, this is an existential threat. Client safety, staff health and financial viability are already at risk. Will worried parents send their children to camp if they could get sick from the outdoor environment? Will outfitters take participants into the smoky backcountry? Can employers protect their staff or will they face liability for long-term exposure? Without strong protections, outdoor organizations cannot provide safe, reliable experiences, and communities across Wyoming will feel the impact. Outdoor recreation is core to Wyoming’s economy and identity, and protecting clean air protects our way of life.
During four days of testimony in August, more than 600 scientists, health professionals, lawmakers and members of the public urged the EPA not to reverse the endangerment finding. Thousands more have submitted comments. Please add your voice and let the EPA know you will not stand by while they abandon their mission to “protect human health and the environment.”
The EPA is accepting public comments on the proposed repeal until Sept. 22. 
Go to https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194 and submit your comment sharing why clean air matters to you, your family, your community and your work.
Clean air is not a luxury. It’s the foundation of Wyoming’s health, outdoor and tourism industries, and our future.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)LINCOLN — State officials will continue to fund Nebraska’s statewide drug disposal program, reversing a midsummer decision not to renew a contract despite legislative funding having been set aside for that purpose.
Lawmakers approved an annual $289,416 appropriation for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to continue contracting for such a program to properly dispose of prescription drugs. It’s the same process that’s been in place for a program the state has at least partially funded since 2015. 
But state officials, as of July 1, refused to renew the contract until this week, effectively freezing the funds.

The state restored funding after the Nebraska Examiner asked DHHS about the cut last week and sought more information from the agency and the Governor’s Office, including why the state cut came without legislative approval and whether DHHS had made any other similar administrative cuts.
“This program is money well spent,” said Haley Pertzborn, CEO of the Nebraska Pharmacists Association, which helps oversee and run the program. “We know it’s heavily utilized by Nebraskans, by communities. It’s a program that honestly runs itself for the most part.”
Elephant in the room
One Hastings pharmacist who has participated in the program since 2016, Katie Trambly, said the state’s decision left her and others in a “holding pattern” and that she was “thrilled” by the reversal.
Trambly said the program had taken a difficult situation for patients who often don’t know what to do with expired or unused medications and made it simpler. She and Pertzborn said the program is particularly helpful to dispose of medications that, if left around, might be targeted for theft or would be particularly toxic to children or pets, including opioids.

Nearly 280,000 pounds of unused medication, or 140 tons, have been disposed of since the program became operational in 2016, according to Amy Holman, project coordinator with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association. That is roughly the size of a blue whale, the largest animal in the world.
The association has also marketed the program’s success by saying the amount of disposed drugs would weigh as much as 16 male African elephants.
The Nebraska program allows people to drop off no longer needed prescription drugs at a participating local pharmacy at no cost to the person dropping off. Meds are then forwarded to Texas to be incinerated.
A hiccup in the program
The Nebraska MEDS Coalition, which consists of community and state partners, including DHHS and the Nebraska State Patrol, helped establish the program in 2016. The effort formed in response to studies by the U.S. Geological Survey and others finding traces of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in U.S. drinking water supplies.
The program has also helped get opioids out of Nebraska homes, with DHHS marketing the program as “every day can be a take-back day in Nebraska.”
In addition to state dollars, the Nebraska Environmental Trust has awarded the program an additional $400,000 annual grant that requires a portion of matching funds. The Trust is funded by Nebraska Lottery proceeds with a goal of funding projects that “conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”

DHHS and state budget officials denied the association’s attempt to renew the contract when the new fiscal year began in July and informed the association of the decision in early August, one month into the fiscal year. That decision inadvertently cut off the Environmental Trust funds, too.
“Drug disposal program costs should be funded by the pharmaceutical and health care industries, not by taxpayers,” Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Gov. Jim Pillen, had told the Nebraska Examiner. “The decision to not spend the appropriation was made after a review of the contract in consideration of an extension beyond the original term.”

Another reason state officials cited for not renewing the contract was the loss of access to federal funding for the program, despite the association having no record of using federal funds.
‘You have to stop everything’
Pertzborn said her team had been proactive in trying to see what would be needed for a contract extension as early as January or February, partly because of the program’s daily use.
Pillen had not targeted the funding for elimination in his latest budget recommendations and did not mention it as a possible cut while lawmakers worked to close a multi-hundred-million-dollar budget shortfall.

Pertzborn said DHHS officials also had repeatedly indicated to her organization that an expected contract renewal was “all good,” so pharmacists continued the program as normal in July.
About a month later, though, in early August, DHHS informed the association that the state budget administrator had denied the contract renewal, leaving Pertzborn and company “alarmed.”
Pertzborn said the association was not “at all” in a position to take on the immediate costs and worked with a network of 270 pharmacies to communicate that pharmacists could no longer order supplies to collect new medications and send them to Texas.
It also meant a pause in a contract between the pharmacists’ association and the local poison control center, which had operated an associated phone line as part of the program.
“You have to stop everything,” Pertzborn told pharmacies. “Use what you have, and we’ll provide you more information as we can.”
The DHHS notification to the association regarding the contract denial said there was a possible appeals process, yet Pertzborn said when her team inquired about how to do so, they learned there was no such process. She said her team was still waiting for documentation that the program had utilized federal funding, too.
Funding restored, contract reconsidered
Over the 10-year lifespan of the program, state lawmakers appropriated nearly $3 million from Nebraska taxpayers. 
DHHS said it used federal funding to replace — not complement — state funding, such as through a targeted opioid drug disposal grant, a state opioid response drug disposal grant and a public health block grant.
A DHHS spokesperson said a total of $100,000 in federal funding had been used over the program’s existence to offset state funding. That federal investment amounts to about 3% of the state investment.
“I understand we have things to cut, I totally understand where they’re coming from,” Pertzborn said. “But I don’t understand cutting something that is so heavily utilized and that is doing a giant service to Nebraska.”

In response to Examiner questions, Strimple confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the state would, following engagement with stakeholders and policymakers, work to extend the contract for this fiscal year, through June 30, 2026.
“This extension will allow for further legislative consideration of this program,” Strimple said.
The move puts the program in the hot seat for the 2026 legislative session as lawmakers are set to address another projected budget shortfall in the middle of a two-year budgeting cycle. Without a change in law, the program would still have at least some dedicated funding through June 30, 2027.
Neither DHHS nor Strimple answered whether the Pillen administration had cut other programs administratively since lawmakers passed the 2025-27 budget in May.
‘A world of difference’
Trambly, director of pharmacy for B&R Stores Inc., which includes Russ’s Market and Super Saver, now oversees 15 pharmacies, including 12 in Nebraska. 
She explained that before the statewide program began, no pharmacy she had worked for had a solid system to dispose of such medications in a healthy way for the community.
Twice-a-year drug take-back programs through the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are helpful, Trambly said. But, she said, that’s “if you catch wind that it’s happening and have the availability to get there that day.”

Pertzborn said the DEA take-back program is also not active in every county and likely misses many Nebraskans. With a daily program, Pertzborn and Tambly said, patients can come at any time a participating pharmacy is open.
“There’s no gray area, it’s black and white. We can take these medications back,” Trambly said.
Trambly said that while she can’t speak to groundwater impacts, she can reflect as a mom of three children on the risk of medications like hormones, narcotics or chemotherapy drugs ending up in the state’s soil or water.
“I’m just really uncomfortable knowing that we wouldn’t be doing anything to prevent that from happening,” Trambly said.
Pertzborn and Trambly said the program also helps grieving families who are sometimes left with medications after a loved one dies. One pharmacy once collected a full trash bag of medicines from one family in such a case, Pertzborn said.
“It makes a world of difference to them and has just been great to be able to provide that to those people,” Trambly said.
Future funding
Multiple lawmakers the Examiner contacted said they weren’t necessarily opposed to the executive branch’s suggestion that pharmaceutical companies pay all or part of the bill. But many said the decision needed to be hashed out, including in the legislative budgeting process.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward was among lawmakers hoping funding could be restored, citing groundwater concerns. She said she was happy to later learn funding would be reestablished.
“As far as who pays for it, that can be discussed, and I’m open to looking for other sources of funding,” Hughes said in a text.
Hughes had successfully worked with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association and Pillen’s team to establish a prescription drug donation program for unexpired medications with Iowa’s SafeNetRx nonprofit. That program launched July 1 despite its own budgetary problems this spring.
The drug disposal and donation programs will both be funded this year, Strimple said.
‘All systems go’: Medicine now flows in Nebraska-Iowa prescription drug donation program

State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said his understanding was that the state had replaced federal funding and that state funding was supposed to be temporary. He noted that it’s unusual for state dollars to replace federal dollars, but in this case, the reverse had happened.
Like Pillen’s team, Clements said he thought pharmaceutical companies profiting from the drugs could contribute to their disposal, similar to how tobacco companies help fund some tobacco prevention programs.
“‘Big Pharma’ could contribute, and they would get some good public relations where they have some negative right now,” Clements said.
While future funding remains an unanswered question, Trambly, Pertzborn and Holman said they are thrilled with the contract reconsideration.
“We are open to any conversations about funding sources and are happy to look at ways that we can adjust the budget for this program going forward,” Holman said Wednesday. “But I think everyone can now see that it is a very important program in Nebraska that people care about and has been very successful for 10 years now.”

(Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun)Ross Dickman and Dan McGurkin know firsthand the difficulty of finding employment and transitioning to civilian life after a career in military service, although their experiences happened about a decade apart. 
Now both men help other veterans and military spouses find employment, including more than 1,200 veterans and spouses in Boise. Last year, the national nonprofit Hire Heroes USA worked with Boise-based Mission43 to connect more than 200 people to jobs in Idaho, and this year the groups are working with nearly 400 veterans around the state.

Dickman is CEO of Hire Heroes USA, which provides one-on-one employment coaching and other services to connect veterans and military spouses with jobs. Dickman works closely with McGurkin, director of Mission43, which provides a range of services to active and former military members and their spouses statewide, including employment, education and engagement events to connect members. 
The nation and Idaho nonprofits started working together around a decade ago, since the inception of Mission43.
“Over the last decade, we’ve found tremendous value in our national employment system plugging in at this local level, where our team members are on the ground, they’re part of this community, they are connected in the events,” Dickman said. “But they also are able to tap into our coaching expertise, our network across the country and really encourage both employers and individuals to think about living, working and making life here in Boise.”
Dickman was visiting Mission43’s headquarters Wednesday at the Idaho Outdoor Fieldhouse in Boise to participate in the 9/11 Miles of Remembrance 5K, scheduled for 5-8 p.m. Thursday, starting at Ann Morrison Park. 
Mission43 launched in 2015 by the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Family Foundation with a goal of making Idaho “the most desirable state for life after the military, and value service,” according to its website. 
 Veterans face unique challenges in employment in Idaho

Dickman joined Hire Heroes USA in 2015 after serving 12 years in the U.S. Army, much of which spent as an AH-64D Apache helicopter pilot. 
McGurkin, a Moscow-native, transitioned out of the military this summer and has been director at Mission43 for about two months. He had been an intelligence officer and infantry officer in the Marine Corps. 
“It is hard to like to come to a place like Idaho and say, ‘all right, I’m here ready to use my skill set,’” McGurkin said. 
Dickman faced a similar challenge, and noted that his metrics of success in the military didn’t have much bearing in the civilian workforce. 
“How many hours, how many missions, how many combat engagements … Those were how we measured effectiveness when I was flying,” he said.

The specialized skills and metrics many veterans leave service with often don’t translate well in an interview. Both organizations are also focused on finding fulfilling careers for servicemembers, often looking for something with upward mobility. 
Dickman said he sees a lot of veterans get put in highly specialized fields that may have matched their training but they get stuck there, with their leadership and other skills remaining under-utilized. He said some of these veterans’ skills would be applicable to a broader range of careers, but the people he works with struggle to articulate how and the employers struggle to understand it. 
“There’s a really positive affinity for veterans and military spouses,” Dickman said, “but doesn’t always necessarily correlate to positive opportunities.” 
Areas around Washington, D.C., with federal and other defense-related industries may offer more opportunities for some veterans with specialized skills, McGurkin said, but there are different kinds of opportunities in Idaho. Mission43 also offers education opportunities, such as programs to obtain certification in project management or cybersecurity.
McGurkin said there is sometimes a gap between the industry veterans are interested in joining and the opportunities in those industries in the Gem State. 
He encourages people who are looking to move or return to Idaho to connect with other veterans here and get a sense of the environment as early in the process as they can and to be open-minded. 
“The earlier you can start those conversations, the better,” McGurkin said. 
 Military spouses face high unemployment nationwide 

Both organizations also have services for spouses of activity duty members and veterans. Those married to service members face even more unique challenges, with an unemployment rate around 22%, five times higher than the civilian population. Constant moves can make it difficult to transfer certifications or find relevant opportunities. 
Dickman said he met his spouse late in his military career while he was working at West Point Academy, so her experience with his active duty service was different from his colleagues who were on deployment cycles. However, upon his exit from service, the couple moved a few times and they learned that navigating different VA health systems was a challenge. 
McGurkin said that he and his wife moved 11 times in the 13 years total he served in ROTC and in the Marines. During that time, his wife went back to school to get a graduate degree, and eventually chose to stay home with their three young children. 
“Of all the people that we have met, we’ve seen people try to navigate it 100 different ways,” McGurkin said.

(Getty Images)For the first time since the COVID-19 vaccine was released, this year a federal health agency put new restrictions on who can get the shot. 
In past years, the annual COVID-19 vaccine was recommended for everyone aged six months and up. The federal Food and Drug Administration — under the leadership of federal health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic — this year has limited the shot to seniors 65 and older and those with an underlying condition that makes them more susceptible to severe illness from the virus.  
Further complicating matters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Committee on Immunization Practices has not yet met to decide on its recommendations for the vaccine.
Because West Virginia law requires pharmacists to have a valid prescription for a vaccine they administer unless the shots are on the CDC’s list of recommended vaccines, West Virginians currently seeking the vaccine at local pharmacies will need a prescription, Gailyn Markham, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said in an email.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet Sept. 18 and 19 to consider their COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. 
An official for the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy wrote on the agency’s website that with a prescription, state pharmacists may administer an age appropriate COVID shot to those age 3 and up prior to the ACIP recommendations. The board plans to update guidance for pharmacists after the ACIP meeting. 
The FDA changes this year have caused confusion for West Virginians seeking the vaccine. They’ve raised questions for local health departments about coverage of the shot and increased demand for the shot at local health departments.  
Shawn Taylor, an attorney and city councilman in Charleston, said he scheduled an appointment with a local Walgreen’s pharmacy to get both the flu and the COVID-19 vaccines. He had planned a trip and wanted to avoid getting a virus from a crowded airport or a plane. 
Taylor, 59, said he got mixed messages from his doctor’s office and the pharmacy about whether he could get the COVID-19 shot with a prescription from his doctor. His primary care office was willing to write one, but they weren’t sure if the pharmacy would have given him the shot even with the prescription. 
He ended up not bringing the prescription to his Walgreens’ appointment. When he got there, a pharmacy employee told him they would have given him the shot with a prescription.
“I ended up not getting the coronavirus vaccine,” Taylor said. “I did get my flu shot.”
Taylor plans to go back to his primary care physician to get his prescription and try again. 
“But heck, it doesn’t do me a lot of good if I end up getting the coronavirus while I’m flying from coast to coast,” he said. 
Taylor said he’s gotten the vaccine seasonally since it became available. He’s concerned about the possibility of going without it this year. As a self-employed attorney, Taylor said he can’t afford to be off of work because of sickness. 
“If I don’t work, I don’t earn any money, I don’t have a paycheck,” Taylor said. “I have to be able to be in motion. I have to be able to perform.”
Brigid Sweeney, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, wrote in an email that the pharmacy is offering the vaccine with a prescription to those over age 65 and to those under age 65 with an underlying condition.
Questions for health departments
Dr. Brian Huggins
Dr. Brian Huggins, health officer for the Monongalia County Health Department in Morgantown, said besides the FDA restrictions, the state has not issued any guidance to local health departments about this year’s changes. 
“Ultimately, we’re just making decisions on our own at the local level,” Huggins said. 
Markham, the Department of Health spokeswoman, said it’s up to local health departments whether they want to stock the vaccine for this fall. 
As of Wednesday, the health department hasn’t received the vaccines, but they’re getting a lot of questions about it, Huggins said.
“In the meantime, I have been e-prescribing the vaccine for patients that we have been seeing in our clinic for other appointments and they have been able to get the shot at local pharmacies with the e-script,” he said. 
The big question, Huggins said, is whether private health insurance companies will cover the vaccine this year, and whether the vaccine will be included in those supplied through the federal government’s Vaccines for Children program. 
While the FDA has narrowed its recommendations, some health care groups have issued their own differing recommendations. The American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending the vaccine for children ages 6 months to two years and to older children who are immunocompromised or in certain other risk groups. The CDC earlier this year removed the recommendation that pregnant people get a COVID shot, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend it. Some states — excluding West Virginia — have even issued their own standing orders for the vaccine, expanding access to the shot.
Huggins said the state health department wouldn’t typically offer guidance to health departments about COVID-19 shots, but until this year, there hadn’t been controversy and conflicting recommendations related to the vaccines.
“I think that’s part of the problem here, is that we’ve never seen where a vaccine that was previously more globally authorized by the FDA that has kind of a retraction, right? I think that’s the confusion at the health department level,” Huggins said. “Normally we would just order vaccines. We can give vaccines because, of course, most insurance companies are just automatically going to pay for people that need to get their vaccine.”
MCHD made the decision to stock enough COVID-19 vaccines to provide to people over 65 because Medicare should pay for them, he said. 
“What we don’t know for sure is what is it going to take to get the shot paid for by an insurance company?” Huggins said. “We believe it would be that if you have one of the qualifying health conditions and you’re under the age of 64 then they in, in theory, the insurance company will pay for it. The problem is, it’s a very expensive vaccine.”
According to the CDC’s vaccine price list, the adult dose of COVID vaccine costs around $140 for the private sector. 
Cathy McAlister, a spokeswoman for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, an insurance company that covers about 250,000 people, said the insurance company has not changed its policy for covering the COVID-19 shot. 
“We will cover COVID shots for people whose physicians say it is necessary, including those who are not in the high-risk category,” McAlister wrote in an email. “Additionally, members should be always consulting with their physician about personal health care needs.”
The insurance company itself won’t require a prescription, she added, but some clinics and pharmacies may require one. 
The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department started offering the COVID-19 shot beginning this week, according to a news release from the agency. The health department is prescribing the vaccine under a standing order from KCHD Health Officer Dr. Steven Eshenaur. The department is not requiring a separate physician’s order if patients attest to having one of the CDC’s list of risk factors for severe illness.
Dr. Steven Eshenaur
Eshenaur said the department’s vaccine management company, VaxCare, has raised questions about whether insurance plans will cover the shot before the CDC committee issues its recommendations. 
“What we have found is that we are getting a number of red lights, per se, or a stop from VaxCare as they run it through the various third-party payers, even for people that meet the guidance per the FDA,” Eshenaur said. “So, for instance, somebody 67 — everybody over 65 is recommended to receive the COVID vaccine and still getting a partner bill coding — meaning that we have to bill the individual’s insurance ourselves, because they have not gotten back authorization from that third-party payer.”
By Wednesday morning, the Kanawha health department’s COVID vaccine supply had run low. Eshenaur said people were coming to the health department after being told at a pharmacy that they need a prescription for the shot. 
“We may actually run out of COVID vaccine as early as today, because we have such unanticipated high demand compared to our numbers last year,” Eshenaur said Wednesday morning. “Because people just can’t go to the pharmacy and get it.”
In a news release Wednesday afternoon, KCHD said it had run out of the vaccine, but would order more.
“It shouldn’t be long until our COVID vaccine supply is replenished,” Eshenaur said in the news release. “We are also working through insurance issues as they arise. This situation is fluid for sure, but our priority is always to take care of the public.”

(Getty Images)Sometimes sitting in Idaho, it is hard to understand the machinations going on in Washington, D.C., especially when it is happening in an obscure congressional subcommittee. But last week the U.S. House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services, Education and Related Agencies made headlines.
On Sept. 2, it voted to slash billions in funding for public education.
Trump campaigned on closing the Education Department. Reality is more difficult.

The budget bill, which now goes to the full House Appropriations Committee, is another punch in the gut for Idaho’s public school students. 
The bill cuts Title I funds by 27 percent. These are the all-important funds that help low-income students improve their academic outcomes. These funds provide tutoring, after-school learning opportunities and enhance parental engagement, among many other things.
In short, these funds are on the front lines of working to narrow the achievement gap between Idaho’s affluent students and the 44 percent of Idaho students who come from low-income families. 
Looking at this year’s ISAT assessment scores on reading and math puts in perspective how important these Title I funds are for Idaho’s low-income students. 
Idaho Education News reported last week that 64 percent of economically advantaged students were proficient in reading compared to 40 percent of economically disadvantaged students. On math, economically advantaged students were 52.4 percent proficient compared to 30 percent of economically disadvantaged students. 
The House subcommittee bill also eliminates all funding for other public-school programs, including funds to support teacher training and development, community schools, and English-language learning programs.
Idaho’s public schools received $65 million in Title I funds during the 2021-22 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Based on that, Idaho’s schools could lose about $20 million in Title I funds if the cuts are equitably distributed across the states.
Idaho’s 2nd District Congressman Mike Simpson is one of eleven Republicans on the subcommittee who voted for these cuts to public education, according to his office. I had to check because Simpson didn’t put out a press release announcing his vote.
Yet on Sept. 3, Simpson put out a press release proudly announcing that the Interior and Environment Subcommittee that he chairs passed a bill that provides $13 million in water projects for Idaho’s cities.
Perhaps Simpson, who supported public education when he was in the Idaho Legislature 26 years ago, has become one of those politicians who only explains his vote when it is good news, and avoids explaining his vote to constituents when it is bad news. And the budget cuts Simpson voted for on last week are certainly unwelcome news for the Idaho students in his district. 
This subcommittee action is on top of the passage of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” (BBB) which Simpson and all members of Idaho’s congressional delegation voted for in July. That bill slashed nearly $1 billion from the country’s Medicaid budget and $300 million from a supplemental nutrition program that feeds hungry students. 
Idaho’s public schools depend on Medicaid funding to ensure that students receive physical and mental health services, among other things. It is especially important funding when you consider that Idaho has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the country. 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump recently admitted that calling it a “Big Beautiful Bill” was not a good marketing move, according to Politico. “I’m not going to use the term,” Trump said. “That was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, a chief architect of the Big Beautiful Bill, spent the August recess in Idaho hosting invitation-only meetings to help sell the bill. Politico reported last week that Crapo is telling GOP colleagues that they need to counter attacks on the bill by making it “very clear that the so-called cuts in Medicaid were not what they are being described in the media, and in fact that they were true waste, fraud and abuse.”
Sen. Crapo lauds ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ and support of group founded by Koch brothers at private event

But don’t be fooled. An independent study by the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy earlier this year said that questionable Medicaid expenses amount to 5 percent of the program’s budget. And most of those were caused by missing or insufficient paperwork.
Most of the abuse came from Medicaid providers, not from the 83 million Americans who receive benefits, the Georgetown study said. In fact, the beneficiaries are the real victims of both unscrupulous providers and politicians who are cutting Medicaid funding. 
In short, Georgetown wrote the “narrative” that there is massive waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid “is simply false.” If the politicians are serious about eliminating abuse, Georgetown said, they only need to “follow the money” to those providers who abuse the system. A real indication that Medicaid abuse is not a significant problem is the Trump Administration’s decision to scale back departmental inspector generals who investigate waste, fraud, and abuse.
Crapo’s charge of Medicaid abuse is really a smokescreen to disguise the real reason President Trump, and the GOP Congress passed the bill – to provide a massive $4.5 billion tax cut to mainly wealthy Americans and corporations. They also don’t want the public to focus on the $4.2 billion increase to the federal deficit caused by the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” (The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pegged the increase to the federal debt by more than $4 billion, including increased interest on the debt.)
It should also be noted that while cutting funding for public education and hungry students by $501 billion, the “Big Beautiful Bill” provides a federal voucher tax credit to provide billions of dollars to fund private and religious schools. This subsidy to private and religious school families will also be added to the federal debt. 
Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Legislature will decide next winter whether Idaho will participate in the federal tax credit program. But Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield already told the Idaho Association of School Administrators in August that she supports adopting the federal tax credit so more money can flow to non-public school programs. 
All of this is unbelievably bad news for Idaho’s public schools which are heavily dependent on federal funding, especially since the state ranks last in the nation on how much it spends on public education. According to the Center for Education Statistics, Idaho public schools receive nearly 20 percent of their funding from the federal government.
Between the Big, Beautiful Bill and last week’s House subcommittee decision to slash Title I funding by 27 percent and zero out other programs, it’s becoming clear the Trump administration and the GOP Congress are waging a war against public schools.
This is an ideological war that hits the more than 300,000 Idaho children who attend public schools hard. And like any innocent citizens caught up in a war zone, Idaho’s students will become collateral damage and pay the price.

(Photo by Michael Chalmers)    Shepherdstown, West Virginia, is about to add a new tradition to its long history. On Saturday, Sept. 20, the town will host its first-ever Constitution Day parade — the “We the People” parade — which begins at 10 a.m. along its main thoroughfare, German Street, culminating downtown in front of Town Hall, where attendees and participants will gather in a community-wide celebration of the nation’s founding document.
The parade coincides with the 20th consecutive Constitution Day Lecture hosted by Shepherd University’s Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education. The lecture series was launched in 2005, when the late Sen. Byrd — West Virginia’s longest-serving senator — successfully championed legislation establishing Constitution Day, commemorating the signing of the Constitution in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, 1787. Byrd himself gave the inaugural lecture in the Senate’s historic caucus room in September 2005. This year’s lecture will take place at the Byrd Center on Wednesday, Sept. 17. 

West Virginia’s oldest town, Shepherdstown offers a fitting stage for such a celebration. Founded more than two decades before the Constitution was signed, the town has been entwined with the nation’s story from its earliest days. In 1775, local patriots joined the Bee Line March to support George Washington’s fledgling army in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and less than a century later, Shepherdstown stood in the shadow of Antietam, site of the bloodiest single day in American history. The parade adds a new chapter to this legacy, linking the nation’s founding ideals to a community that has long embodied them.

Earlier this summer, Shepherdstown resident and parade committee member and organizer, Mark Kohut, had been engaged in conversations and discussion groups around the topic of the Constitution for some time when he got a call from a friend who had an idea that felt both timely and appropriate.

“She said, ‘Let’s have a parade for Constitution Day,’” he said. “We have the Byrd Center right here, and the town loves parades. I said yes immediately — it just felt right.” 

Recognizing Shepherdstown’s robust connection to civic engagement, Kohut explained that feedback was quick and informative. “News goes halfway around this town before the other half wakes up,” he said. “Every person I talk to seems to want to know more. The only concern I get is ‘Is there time to pull it off?’ I think we can. The numbers continue to climb daily on Facebook.” 

 Now is the time

Local business owner and retired Gallaudet University professor, Jan Hafer, was the friend who called Kohut. For Hafer, the idea drew not only on her love for Shepherdstown and its history, but also on a lifelong commitment to civic engagement and education.
“For me, the inspiration for a parade came soon after the Bee Line March celebration earlier this summer,” she said. 

Hafer, who still carries a copy of the Constitution with her daily, called the event a powerful reminder of the region’s Revolutionary War history. 
“Those farmers marched to Boston to join the Revolution — which ultimately served as the beginning of the U.S. Army. This is important history, and it made me reflect on how much I appreciate our early roots.”
Hafer’s connection to the Constitution runs deeper than casual interest. During her time at Gallaudet, she co-taught a course on Supreme Court cases that shaped education policy, working alongside a lawyer to guide undergraduates through landmark decisions. The textbook they used was one of Congressman Jamie Raskin’s works, “We the Students: Supreme Court Cases for and About Students.”
“We took our students to the Supreme Court to watch a special education case being litigated, and Congressman Raskin even guest-lectured in our class,” she recalled. “That experience left a big impression on me and gave me a lasting appreciation for the Constitution.”
So when she and Kohut started workshopping the idea for a parade in Shepherdstown, “We thought, next year is the country’s 250th anniversary — can we create something that is in line with that and welcomes all-comers?” she said. “Mark did the work to get it approved by Town Council, started talking to people, and networking as he does. I became a sounding board.” 
In addition to the parade, Constitution Day events around Shepherdstown that week will include public readings of the Constitution, student engagement projects in local schools, trivia nights and scavenger hunts inspired by constitutional history, and special foods and treats — including a new ice cream created for the occasion.
Kohut acknowledged, “When I pitched the idea to Town Council, I spoke of Sen. Byrd, a Democrat, as well as Newt Gingirich, a Republican, who led Republicans to read the Constitution in Congress when they took it over in 1995. One of the council members in attendance notably said, ‘Now is the time.’”

Kohut also pointed out that his goal for the event is long-term. “I hope this certainly gains momentum locally — but an additional aim would be for the spirit, concept, and energy behind it to spread to other places, other towns, other cities.”

Sense of  continuity 
Ray Smock, former director of the Byrd Center and former historian of the U.S. House of Representatives, sees the parade as part of a larger civic opportunity.
“This local parade will raise awareness of the Constitution in our community,” he said. “And the idea of Constitution Day parades just might catch on. We all celebrate the Fourth of July. The Declaration of Independence was and is a big deal. But the new government that came out of the American Revolution was a big deal too. Take a look at the 52 words of the Preamble to the Constitution. It tells us what government should do and what government is for. Each generation of Americans needs to understand what the Constitution stands for.”
That sense of continuity — that the work of democracy belongs to each generation — is central to why Shepherdstown’s first Constitution parade feels so fitting to Zach Dougherty, current Byrd Center director, who echoed Smock’s sentiment.“Shepherdstown really represents the American narrative — that ordinary people, when pressed under extraordinary circumstances, are capable of meeting the challenge and making sure that the definition of what our Constitution stands for is met, expanded and extended to more Americans every generation,” he said.
Smock, who worked with Byrd during the bicentennial of the Constitution in the 1980s, added that the senator would have appreciated Shepherdstown’s efforts to expand the tradition beyond the lecture series. 
“No senator in American history has done more than West Virginia’s Sen. Byrd to promote the importance of the Constitution,” he said. “I worked with him on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. He is gone now and I can’t speak for him, but I do know that he understood that education often begins with an event, a ceremony, a speech, and it is the effort to honor the Constitution that is important, even if only one person turned out for the parade.”

Mutual obligation 
As Shepherdstown prepares for its first Constitution Day parade, Mayor James Gatz sees the event as a reflection of the town’s enduring character — and its place in the American story.
“This parade is about more than honoring a date on the calendar — it’s an opportunity to strengthen community connections,” he said. “It’s about bringing people together — family, neighbors, students, visitors — to celebrate the core principals upon which our nation is based and to remind ourselves that the Constitution belongs to all of us. 
“In a small town like Shepherdstown, where history is part of daily life, it’s a chance to honor that past while also recommitting to the values that guide our nation. I invite all residents from Shepherdstown and surrounding areas to come and celebrate with us.”
That sense of recommitment is crucial, Smock said. “Each generation of Americans has had to find ways to preserve and defend the Constitution. It is not a machine that runs by itself. The words of the Constitution are important, but it is positive actions and a respect for the rule of law that make it possible to keep our republic going strong. 
“Right now, constitutional government is in crisis largely because not enough citizens understand that the Constitution puts restraints on the people as well as those who hold high office. It calls for a separation of powers in three branches of government. At present, all the power seems to be in one branch, and this is not healthy.”
Smock has seen the Constitution tested before. During his time as House historian, he occasionally lunched with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who chaired the national commission commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. He recalled Burger sharing his perspective on one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions in American history — the ruling that forced President Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes.
“I asked the Chief Justice what he thought was the significance of that decision,” Smock said. “He said that no one knew for sure how President Nixon would react. What if he refused to turn over the tapes? In the meantime, Republican members of the House and Senate visited Nixon to inform him that Congress would probably impeach him and remove him from office. Faced with impeachment, and faced with the decision of the Supreme Court, Nixon decided to resign. Congress and the Supreme Court put constitutional pressure on the president. Chief Justice Burger said, ‘The Constitution worked.’ And that made all the difference. Checks and balances are essential, and no person is above the law.”
For Dougherty, that lesson continues to resonate. “When you look at the Constitution, the remarkable thing in our current context is that you won’t find the word Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Whether you’re a kid in New Jersey or an older citizen from West Virginia, you are viewed as equal under the law. In the current climate we’re living in, it’s important for all Americans to remember that we have a mutual obligation to each other — a mutual responsibility to the ideals of the Constitution. It has never been, nor will it ever be, just a document. It’s something we have to live and uphold every day.”

Hundreds of people have turned out at community meetings, rallies and local government meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed expansion of one of the largest factory farms in the region. 
In May, 100 people showed up to get organized in support of a legal challenge against Ridge Breeze Dairy’s permit to spread 80 million gallons of manure across western Wisconsin. Another 100 people showed up in the town of Maiden Rock to support the passage of an operations ordinance aimed at protecting local health and property values. Over 400 people registered for a DNR public hearing last year to show their opposition to the expansion.
These actions represent a growing unity and commitment to safeguarding clean water, clean air and the small farms that are threatened by Breeze’s expansion. That kind of unity drives action. It inspired the Maiden Rock town board’s unanimous vote to pass its operations ordinance in December 2024. And it’s inspired many more towns that have started studying and drafting ordinances of their own. 
For the last two years, Grassroots Organizing Western Wisconsin (GROWW) has played a key role in bringing together ordinary people and small farmers to pass local ordinances to protect our homes. People across the region are holding strong as corporate mega-dairies try to take over our agricultural landscape. 
But powerful special interests are trying to prevent local leaders from taking action to protect our communities. Venture Dairy, a lobbying group representing industrial dairy interests, strongly supports Ridge Breeze Dairy’s $35 million plan to expand from 1,700 to 6,500 cows and has attempted to intimidate towns and counties looking to protect their land, water and roads from the impacts of industrial agriculture. 
In 2020, for instance, leaders at Venture Dairy falsely told Polk County supervisors that they would be committing a felony if they voted for a moratorium on factory farm expansions. The Wisconsin Counties Association’s general counsel wrote a letter publicly refuting this ridiculous claim. More recently, officials in towns like Pepin, Gilman and Rock Elm have been subjected to similar intimidation tactics and disinformation regarding the regulation of industrial dairy farms.
The truth is that, thanks to the efforts of industry lobbyists whittling down and undermining state rules and enforcement, oversight of large-scale livestock operations in Wisconsin has been stretched thin. With more than 330 factory farms across Wisconsin, our communities have largely been left to fill the gap. 
But that’s still too much for Venture Dairy. They were recently behind a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s authority to protect water quality. If they had gotten their way, there would be no DNR regulations for hundreds of factory farms across the state. Last month, that lawsuit was rejected unanimously by an appeals court.
Venture Dairy’s founding members include Todd Tuls, former owner of the Emerald Sky Dairy in St Croix County. In Emerald, the town well – only half-a-mile away from the facility – has nitrate levels that have reached as high as six times the Safe Drinking Water standards. Emerald Sky had a 300,000-gallon manure spill in 2016 that went unreported for months before a neighbor notified the state. Emerald Sky has since been sold to Breeze Dairy Group, owners of Ridge Breeze Dairy in Pierce County.

Despite these challenges, people in western Wisconsin are making real progress. In the face of industry opposition, we are successfully organizing to fight the corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry. Our community organizing resulted in the DNR recently removing 2,000 acres from Ridge Breeze’s manure spreading plan due to risks to groundwater and surface water that we identified. If not for our comments provided in the public hearing process, those acres very likely would have been rubber stamped. Last year, we identified hundreds of acres of land that had been listed on Ridge Breeze’s plan for manure spreading without permission from landowners. Due to our organizing and public pressure at a public hearing, we were able to get that land removed and require Ridge Breeze to submit affidavits attesting to the fact that they have permission to spread on the land listed on their plan. Unfortunately, these affidavits have not worked, and people have continued to come forward to remove their land. 
Recognizing the holes in state regulations, we organized to pass local ordinances like the operations ordinance in the town of Maiden Rock, which was passed last year and protects the town residents from the risks of factory farms. That organizing is now reverberating through the region, with people in western Wisconsin and beyond going to town board meetings with their neighbors to create the change they need to protect their homes. Just this week, 75 neighbors gathered in the town of Isabelle for a public hearing on an operations ordinance drafted by their town board. Those neighbors were united in their support for clean water, clean air and local control.
Regular people have decided the future of rural Wisconsin is worth fighting for, but the only way to change the path we’re on is to get organized. It’s time to join together with your neighbors who share your vision for your community and make a plan to bring change. The future of our rural communities depends on it.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-10-at-5.03.43 PM-1024x656.png,,,2025-09-11 06:56:30.168437

(Google Maps)​​A federal appeals court heard oral arguments Wednesday in a case challenging the ability of Colorado legislators to require respectful speech during legislative hearings. 
The initial lawsuit, filed last year in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, claimed the state legislators named as defendants violated the plaintiffs’ right to free speech by stopping them from misgendering and deadnaming transgender people during their testimony in a legislative committee hearing. 
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Rich Guggenheim and Christina Goeke, seek damages and for the court to block enforcement of decorum rules around respectful language in committee hearings at the Colorado General Assembly.

In March 2024, they both testified against House Bill 24-1071, which added gender-affirming care to the definition of good cause for when a person convicted of a felony petitions to change their legal name. During their testimony, Guggenheim and Goeke repeatedly misgendered and deadnamed Tiara Latrice Kelley, a transgender woman for whom the law was named.
The plaintiffs opposed the bill because they believe “it will make it easier for transgender individuals to conceal criminal convictions and thus pose a danger to children, women, and vulnerable populations,” the initial complaint says.
Judge Regina Rodriguez dismissed the case in November 2024, concluding that the legislators’ actions were “within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity” and that the plaintiff’s claims are moot because the bills they testified on already passed and became law, and the decorum rules and restrictions they challenged were set specifically for testimony on that law. 
“Plaintiffs have not pointed to any ‘continuing, present adverse effects’ beyond speculation that there will potentially be future bills that implicate transgender concerns, that Plaintiffs will likely want to testify on these potential bills, and that the same decorum rules and restrictions may be put in place for any public testimony hearings on these potential bills,” Rodriguez wrote in her order.
The plaintiffs, who are represented by attorneys from the conservative Institute for Free Speech, appealed Rodriguez’s order to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a panel of three judges heard the case Wednesday. 
Endel Kolde, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the state legislators discriminated against and censored the plaintiffs based on their viewpoints. He argued deadnaming and misgendering should be permitted if they are done in relation to substantive argument about legislation, to which Judge Joel Carson responded, “Isn’t that really hard for courts to police?”
Kolde also argued that legislative immunity does not apply to this case, and saying it does would allow legislative bodies to censor anyone they disagree with.
Edward Ramey, attorney for the defendants, said legislative immunity is the “primary defense” in the case, as the limitations the state legislators set were for “legitimate legislative activity.” He said it is up to the legislators overseeing legislative hearings what rules they want to set for their committee hearings.
Rules for public testimony in both the Colorado House and Senate note that a committee chair has the discretion to limit testimony and ask for disruptive people to be removed. Legislative hearings are limited public forums, which means the discussion can be confined to a certain topic and must follow the rules set ahead of time.
Legislators named in the lawsuit include state Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat who previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adam County Democrat; former Rep.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A legal challenge to a new state law that criminalizes the act of concealing or sheltering individuals illegally in the country had its first day in court Wednesday as a federal judge weighed a motion to temporarily block portions of the legislation as the case goes forward.
The Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America filed suit against the Tennessee law just days before it took effect July 1.
The denomination argued the law, passed as part of a Republican effort to align state policy with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, puts pastors and church members at risk for criminal charges in carrying out their faith-driven mission to offer shelter and sanctuary to individuals regardless of immigration status. 
Lawyers for the Synod argued that the law is an infringement on religious freedom, vaguely written and illegally sets immigration policy, a responsibility that falls to Congress. 
A Nashville landlord, concerned about criminal charges for renting to an immigrant without legal status, and an unidentified immigrant from Mexico are also plaintiffs in the suit. 
An attorney defending the measure argued that pastors had a “needless fear of the law.”
Suit seeks to block Tennessee law that makes it a crime to “harbor” certain immigrants

The law makes it a crime to harbor immigrants “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain” and is intended to apply to “professional smuggling operations,” not churches that accept donations to provide services to those in need, argued Miranda Jones, senior assistant attorney general. 
U.S. District Judge William Campbell, Jr. urged lawyers on both sides to agree on a compromise that would spell out that the law, at least temporarily, would not be enforced against members of the Lutheran Synod.
That effort failed once Jones told Campbell her superiors in the Tennessee Office of Attorney General would not agree; the state’s position is the law won’t target houses of worship, making a written agreement between the two parties unnecessary, she said.
“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,” Campbell responded. “It’s difficult to understand the harm.” 
Campbell instead required the attorneys to report to the court if any individuals represented in the suit faced arrest or prosecution under the new law. 
Thus far, no one has been charged with a crime under the new law, Jones said.
Campbell deferred a decision on the request to temporarily halt the portion of state law that makes it a felony offense to harbor immigrants in the country illegally, saying he would “take it under advisement.”
Separately on Wednesday, 21 Republican attorneys general filed a brief in the case supporting Tennessee’s law. 
“Many States have enacted state crimes that complement federal immigration laws like the law enacted by Tennessee that Plaintiffs seek to enjoin,” they wrote. “Those complements are no conflict or obstacle to federal immigration law. Instead, they help States support federal immigration enforcement goals.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-11 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Catastrophic Failures’: Why Dozens of Killings In Mississippi Prisons Go Unanswered,"Daja E. Henry, The Marshall Project and Mina Corpuz",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/11/mississippi-prison-killings-death/,At least 42 incarcerated people have been killed in the last decade in Mississippi prisons. Just six people have been convicted in their deaths.,"At least 42 people have been killed inside Mississippi prisons in the past decade, leaving scores of grieving families questioning a system that fails to protect people in its custody or hold anyone accountable.
There are sisters wracked with guilt, mothers with depression, and children struggling to fill the voids in their lives. Former prison employees talk about lying sleepless in bed, replaying the killings they’ve witnessed but could not stop.
In Mississippi, prison homicides are the culmination of long-documented festering problems: chronic understaffing, lax oversight, gangs that rule by violence and delays in treating life-threatening injuries, an investigation by a statewide reporting team found.
Murders signal “catastrophic failures” of prison administrators, whose number one job is to keep incarcerated people safe, said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project.
The perpetrators haven’t faced justice in most cases. Just six of the 42 homicides have led to convictions. 
And the killings show no sign of ending. In the first half of this year, there were five homicides in three Mississippi prisons.
Sydney Miller said her family was given almost no details by prison officials after her elder brother, Gregory Emary, was stabbed to death at the Chickasaw County Regional Facility in Houston in 2020. 
Over the past five years, they have received no contact from prison investigators or prosecutors about what happened or if someone would be held responsible. Miller did not know Emary’s death had been deemed a homicide by a medical examiner until a reporter told her. She wonders if her family would have been treated the same way if her brother had been killed on the outside. 
“So why is this any different?” Miller asked. “Just because it was committed inside prison walls?”
‘No one deserves to die like this’
Uncovering the toll of Mississippi’s prison homicides took a team of reporters from five news organizations: The Marshall Project – Jackson, Mississippi Today, the Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. The team scoured thousands of pages of court records, corrections documents, federal and state government death records, and interviewed families, formerly incarcerated people, former guards, attorneys and corrections experts. 
The investigation found that the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, which holds about 2,500 people, has had the most killings in the past decade. At least 19 people died in homicides at Parchman from 2015 through 2024.
For most of this time period, the homicide rate among people inside Parchman was five times higher than the state as a whole, which already had the highest rate in the country in 2023.
Lack of consistent and accurate reporting nationwide makes a state-by-state comparison of prison homicides difficult. The reporting team identified three Mississippi homicides that were not listed in federal and state reports.
Most of the 42 killings throughout the state prison system involved beatings or stabbings, sometimes involving multiple assailants. Three in five victims were Black. The age of the victims ranged from 23 to 62.

Mississippi Department of Corrections officials declined multiple requests for an interview about killings across the prison system, but released an emailed statement. “MDOC remains committed to ensuring the safety of inmates in its custody,” the agency wrote.
Many of the people who were killed in Mississippi’s prisons were sent there after being convicted of offenses that included parole and probation violations, as well as more serious crimes, including robbery and murder. At least a quarter were serving life sentences. Although prison officials have a legal duty to protect all incarcerated people from harm, they could not protect them from death at the hands of cellmates, rival gang members or other incarcerated people.
In one case, a corrections officer pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact in a 2021 murder.
Detrick Munford, who served as deputy warden of Parchman until 2022, said the number of unprosecuted homicides doesn’t surprise him.
Mississippi officials didn’t install many of the cameras at Parchman until after 2020, so in many cases, there was no way to prove who was responsible for a death, he said. Anyone who witnessed a killing “is not going to talk,” he said, alluding to the prison culture of violent retribution, “because he knows what might happen to him.”
MDOC often shares sparse details about prison homicides, if any at all, even with the families of the victims. Nearly all internal investigations into the killings are hidden from the public because the state’s open records law exempts all law enforcement investigative files.
Although many of the recent homicides were filmed by security cameras and some of those responsible are known to corrections officials based on internal reports, local prosecutors filed charges against suspects in 36% of the homicides in the past decade.
MDOC officials responded in their email that prison officials take “every death of an inmate in its custody seriously. Each suspected homicide is investigated…The remaining investigations that are closed did not support a referral (for prosecution).”
In one criminal case, a charge was filed, but the Marshall County District Attorney’s office essentially forgot to prosecute the suspect nearly four years after the prison killing. The indictment had gotten lost in the bureaucracy, District Attorney Ben Creekmore later acknowledged in an interview. It was reactivated only after a reporter from the news team called him about the case.
The prospect of criminal prosecution, however, is likely of little concern to someone already serving a multi-decade sentence. The continued killings show how the prison system has not significantly addressed its failures to prevent homicides. The reporting team identified one person who pleaded guilty to manslaughter for a killing in one prison, then allegedly went on to kill again in another prison. He is awaiting trial on the second homicide charge and is currently serving a 40-year sentence.
DeAndre Davis was serving a life sentence when he was stabbed to death in 2017 in the Wilkinson County Correctional Facility in Woodville, months after he was stabbed in another attack at the same prison. At the sentencing hearing for the man convicted of the killing, Davis’ mother, Victorra Williams, said she didn’t understand why her son died, because he was supposed to be in isolation after he received a death threat. 
“No one deserves to die like this,” she told the judge.
“I understand that they are in prison, and I understand that they are (caged), but I don’t understand you are in prison and you are steady killing each other for no reason,” Williams said. “That’s just — that’s crazy.” 
Punishment after killing: loss of privileges
Growing up, Marcie Harper protected her baby brother, Joshua Odom. He was smaller than the other kids, so she fought his fights. She called him her Cabbage Patch Kid because of his big blue eyes and bald head. Her brother grew into a wiry man who loved to fish, gaining him the nickname Catfish.
“I was always there for him,” Harper said.
But Odom developed a drug problem that landed him in and out of prison, locked away from his big sister, who couldn’t always afford to visit or talk to him on the phone. 
She could not be there to protect her brother on Jan. 12, 2025. 
He died, a casualty of prison violence, lax security and questionable medical care that gave superficial treatment to a head wound that would prove fatal. 
Odom was incarcerated at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville. His friend Shelby Peevyhouse, who has a pacemaker, had just gotten into a fight and been kicked in the chest. As Odom came over to check on his friend, Peevyhouse said later, another incarcerated person punched Odom, knocking him to the ground, where he hit his head and fell unconscious.
When Odom came to, guards were restraining him, Peevyhouse said from prison.
“Don’t kill him. He needs your help,” Peevyhouse pleaded with the guards as they wrestled Odom. Both men were taken to the medical wing.
“Catfish was laying there screaming for help in a medical gurney to the left of me, calling for his mama,” Peevyhouse said. 
Guards declined to call an ambulance and went home, as their shifts were ending, Peevyhouse said. Instead, he said, a medical staffer glued Odom’s head wound shut and sent both injured men back to their housing unit. 
Odom, though, was dazed. He couldn’t even say his name. Peevyhouse tried to keep his friend awake. 
“I did not know what to do,” Peevyhouse said. “I was so scared.”
As Odom began vomiting a “pink foam,” Peevyhouse banged on a window. He says he told a guard coming around for a count to call medical or else he would start a fire. 
A medical worker took Odom away in a wheelchair. “Hey, smile a little,” Odom said before being wheeled off. Peevyhouse lit a cigarette for his friend, told him he loved him, and that he would be there when Odom got back. This time, an ambulance was called. It was too late. 
The next morning, Peevyhouse found out Odom was dead. 
“He was my best friend. This is really hard for me,” Peevyhouse said repeatedly.
The state medical examiner ruled Odom’s death a homicide by blunt force trauma. Because his alleged attacker was never criminally charged, the reporting team is not naming him. Imprisoned on a domestic violence conviction, he is scheduled for release by 2028.
The suspect was issued a disciplinary citation for assaulting another person. Prisons use a rules violation book that outlines dozens of actions that are prohibited inside prison walls, from hoarding food to attacking others. According to a rule violation report obtained by the reporting team, guards used security camera footage to confirm the assault.
The suspect’s punishment was the loss of 180 days of earned time — time that would have reduced his sentence for good conduct — as well as lost phone and visitation privileges for 60 days, and he was held responsible for Odom’s medical costs, which were not listed. He did not receive a higher violation for causing Odom’s death. The next day, he was transferred to another facility, which is MDOC’s standard procedure.

State Rep. Becky Currie, a registered nurse, has publicly criticized VitalCore, the company contracted to provide medical care in the state’s prisons, after meeting and receiving letters from incarcerated people who claim they were not getting care for treatable illnesses and injuries. 
“It is hard for me to hear that (MDOC) feels that they provide adequate care,” Currie told Mississippi Today. 
A spokesperson for VitalCore told Mississippi Today that the company provides “comprehensive and competent health care services in accordance with prevailing standards of care.”
After Odom’s death, his sister said the family could not get a clear story from prison officials.
The official who called their mother said Odom had been found hurt and died at the hospital. It wasn’t until someone connected to Peevyhouse sent her a Facebook message that she found out that her brother died waiting for an ambulance.
The 40-year-old Odom, incarcerated since 2018 after being convicted of burglary and credit card fraud, was supposed to be released in a few weeks, his family said.
“I just wish I had something of his,” Harper said. Instead, all she has left are memories and his ashes, which the family plans to scatter in the Gulf, where he loved to fish, on his birthday. 
Soon, she’ll also have a tattoo of a catfish on a hook with a phrase he always told her: “Keep your head up.”
Constitutional violations, few answers
Odom’s death came less than a year after the federal Department of Justice found that three Mississippi prisons — including the South Mississippi prison where he had been held — violated the constitutional rights of the more than 7,400 people housed in them by failing to protect them from widespread violence. The investigation listed numerous failures: gross understaffing, assaults that are likely undercounted because of this lack of staff supervision, gang brawls involving dozens of people, violent incidents that go uninvestigated, and bungled investigations that lead nowhere.
The Justice Department had found similar violations in a 2022 investigation of the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. 
What Odom’s family experienced is common. The reporting team found that the families of other incarcerated people killed in prison were often left without answers. Many of those interviewed learned details about their loved ones’ deaths through a whisper network of incarcerated people, insiders, advocates, and, in some cases, from journalists. 
Some families contacted lawyers, attempting to file civil suits, only to find out that no one would take their cases.
“I literally just gave up on it,” said Dale Graham, whose brother was killed in the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in 2021. “Nothing happened.”
Currie, a Brookhaven Republican, who chairs the state’s House Corrections Committee, has raised questions about how the prisons are run, including the health and safety of the incarcerated.
She said prison killings show that violence is rampant inside the state’s prisons, and that it’s amplified by issues such as contraband and gangs. 
“Whatever the cause of death is, I think the families are owed an answer,” she said. “Was my loved one killed? Was it that their diabetes wasn’t tended to? What was the cause of death?” Currie asked. “And I do not know of one family that’s ever received that answer.”
She has wondered how seemingly healthy men die in Mississippi’s prisons. Currie said she plans to introduce legislation to create a group of lawmakers and prison officials to look into all prison deaths, which can serve as a guide on how to prevent future deaths. 
In a written response to reporters’ questions, MDOC said the department has taken several corrective measures since the Justice Department began investigating the prison system in 2020, including improved training, facility upgrades and increased staffing.
MDOC said the Justice Department’s investigation is ongoing, and both sides are engaged in confidential settlement negotiations. 
A deadly prison economy
Violent deaths in Mississippi prisons tend to lead back to the same factors: understaffing, poor training, and gang control, according to lawyers, experts, former corrections staffers interviewed, and the Justice Department reports. 
Prison guards, many of whom are young and female, are poorly trained and sometimes left alone to oversee units holding as many as 180 men, according to Catina Washington, a former MDOC case manager who said she was assaulted in December 2020 by an incarcerated person at the South Mississippi prison. Her attacker was charged with simple assault, but the charge was later dropped due to conflicting witness testimony.
Guards make decisions on whether a sick or injured person can see a prison nurse or even go to a hospital. 
“We don’t realize how much trust of another person’s life we put into the hands of correctional officers,” said Greta Kemp Martin, formerly the litigation director of Disability Rights Mississippi. “They literally hold your life in their hands.”
Poor oversight allows gang members to take advantage of the security gaps, buying and selling illegal drugs and cellphones, sometimes with the help of prison guards whom they recruit to smuggle contraband in. The reporting team identified several criminal cases in which corrections officers were charged with bringing in drugs or cellphones. Martin said some incarcerated clients have told her about correctional officers who share gang affiliations with them. 
The gangs run a brutal underground economy. A debt to the wrong person can cost a life, as it did for 31-year-old Jeremy Irons, who was killed over $40 in Parchman, federal and state reports showed. 
The Justice Department’s investigations found that the facilities operated at dangerously low staffing levels. In 2022, the Central Mississippi prison was operating with 44% of the employees needed to run the facility. At the South Mississippi prison, where Odom was later killed, the facility ran with 36% of the necessary employees. And in Wilkinson County’s prison, a human resources manager told investigators that the officer vacancy rate hovered around 50%.
Chronic understaffing is a key factor in prison homicides across the nation, said Fathi, of the ACLU National Prison Project. And what staff there is may be poorly trained to handle violence.
Former MDOC staffers reported that their training was rushed, leaving them unprepared for the dangers of the job. 
“Parchman is all about ‘We’re gonna hurry up and get you out of class, throw your ass out there, because we need people to watch the inmates,” a former correctional officer, who did not want his name used for fear of retaliation, told a reporter. “Many times I’ve seen people get killed right in front of me, and it really wasn’t nothing you could really do, because you ain’t but one person.”
Chuck Mullins, a lawyer who has represented Mississippi families in wrongful prison death cases for decades, said in many of the death cases he has litigated, he found that staff were either not present or poorly trained.
Chronic understaffing and poor training endanger both the incarcerated people and corrections staff, leaving many who remain fearful to do their jobs. The Justice Department’s reports cited multiple instances of staff failing or refusing to do security counts and falsifying count sheets. 
Disciplinary reports reviewed by the reporting team show corrections officers being overpowered, beaten, choked, stabbed, spit on and sprayed with human waste. 
Fatal beating overlooked for five hours
Army veteran Ronnie Graham survived combat in Iraq. He survived cancer.
He did not survive nine days inside the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Pearl. 
In the early hours before dawn in December 2021, prison security camera footage captured a man attacking Graham near his bunk, choking and kicking him in the head, according to federal and state records reviewed by the reporting team. 
Throughout the night, Graham passed in and out of consciousness. Later, another person punched him in the face. More than five hours later, an officer found Graham and called for help. By then, his body was rigid, and he was foaming at the mouth. Graham died soon after help arrived. 
For at least five hours, Graham suffered. And for most of that time, guards were nowhere to be found. An investigative report noted that an officer turned the lights off in the unit about 45 minutes after Graham was attacked, but no officer walked through to check on the welfare of the men held there. 
“If someone would have done their job that night, he would still be alive today,” his brother, Dale Graham, said. “But because someone didn’t do their job, my brother is now dead.”
No one was charged in Graham’s death.
Lawsuits and internal prison reports show that, on multiple occasions, guards did not find a dead person for hours.
Earlier this year, Jonathan Havard was strangled in the Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. A parent, who found out about the death through unknown means, notified the prison that someone in Havard’s cell was dead, according to an internal MDOC report. 
Last year, a group of roughly 10 people beat and stabbed 28-year-old Edward Boyd to death at East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Lauderdale County, according to a lawsuit his family filed against the private prison company that operates the lockup, Management & Training Corp. The suit stated that the attackers killed him “in plain view of surveillance camera” and then “dragged (Boyd) into a cell, where they left him to die.” 
He was found covered in blood during a morning count. The lawsuit alleges that a correctional officer wrote in a report that they had last seen Boyd alive and well during a 4 a.m. count. However, there was no evidence of a count being conducted at 4 a.m., according to the lawsuit.
In response to the lawsuit, MTC denied any negligence or wrongdoing. The case is pending in federal court.
Dead-end investigations
When someone is killed in a Mississippi prison, typically, the department conducts an investigation. It interviews staff, witnesses, sometimes confidential informants, people it believes to be complicit in the death, and reviews camera footage.  
MDOC sometimes requests help from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. 
However, the U.S. Justice Department found many investigations by the department were incomplete, failed to answer key questions or were mishandled. 
Investigations of homicides that stemmed from fights over drug debts routinely ignored the source of the drugs or failed to conduct follow-up interviews.
During the 2022 Parchman investigation, a supervisor in MDOC’s investigative division told Justice Department officials that the caseload was too heavy and staffers were too overworked to conduct comprehensive investigations.
For example, after Jeremy Irons was stabbed to death in 2019, the internal investigation concluded that one incarcerated person stabbed him and flushed the weapon down the toilet. 
The investigation into Irons’ death relied on one written statement from a trainee officer. No other staff was interviewed. However, several other people took part in the fight, which stemmed from Irons’ $40 debt to another person, according to the Justice Department. 
After MDOC concludes its investigations, it may pass its findings along to local county district attorneys, who can then seek an indictment from a grand jury. 
In an August 2019 case, Samuel Wade was strangled to death at Parchman. The Justice Department’s investigation references an incarcerated person strangled with a bedsheet that month. The victim’s cellmate allegedly confessed to the killing, and MDOC referred the case to the Sunflower County district attorney, according to the investigation. After six years, however, no charges have been filed.
Sunflower County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson has not responded to multiple interview requests.
Criminal charges have only been filed in five of the 19 killings in Parchman over the past decade. Four of those cases are pending in the courts. The fifth was dismissed after the defendant died by suicide.
Other district attorneys with prisons in their counties did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on open cases. 
Experts said secrecy around prison operations and the lack of oversight, coupled with the general public’s lack of concern toward incarcerated people, allow the long-documented abuses and civil rights violations to continue. 
Reforms to reduce deaths in custody have been hampered by “the secrecy that pervades prisons and jails,” said Andrea Armstrong, a Loyola University New Orleans law professor and leading researcher on deaths behind bars.
Many of the prison incident records the reporting team obtained came with scant narratives or with entire sections blacked out, even though such records are public under the state’s open records law.
In the past decade, at least five families of people killed in Mississippi prisons have filed civil lawsuits against the Department of Corrections or Management & Training Corp. However, documents in these lawsuits, such as evidence and settlement details, are often sealed or protected by confidentiality agreements.
For the incarcerated people who have been killed, their families are left with little, other than despair. 
“This (is) an unimaginable pain you all gave me. This grief will last forever,” one victim’s mother wrote in a court statement for the upcoming trial of the prison murder of her son. 
“People talk about justice. They say it’s blind. But justice shouldn’t be silent. It shouldn’t turn away when someone dies in state custody,” she wrote. “If the state takes responsibility for a person’s life, it should also be held accountable when that life is lost.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)This Monday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey hosted a press conference at the state capitol with West Virginia lawmakers and a few guests. The purpose of the press conference was to celebrate the donation of 2,500 “In God We Trust” posters to be put up at schools and in classrooms around the state. 
The donation became possible after the legislature was finally successful last session in passing a bill to require these displays in schools. It doesn’t allow public funds to be spent on them, which screams to me that someone already had an idea about who could possibly fund the initiative, especially if schools needed to have them up before the start of the new school year as the bill suggests.  
It turns out the backers are affiliated with a national push to blur the constitutional separation between church and state. One of the speakers was Andrea Justus, who works at First Liberty Institute. That organization takes religious freedom cases around the country. They also were on the advisory board for the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. 
One might remember Project 2025 as being the masterplan that President Donald Trump claimed he never heard of during his 2024 presidential campaign and was not affiliated with. Despite that claim, his administration has still followed its playbook to dismantle environmental protection programs, health care and other civic institutions this year. 
The actual funder for the posters that are required to be posted in every school in West Virginia is Patriot Mobile, a conservative cell phone service. Patriot Mobile also has a conservative political action committee named Patriot Mobile Action. Among other goals, they have worked to get religious people elected to take over school boards. In 2022 NBC News wrote an investigation titled “How a far-right, Christian cellphone company ‘took over’ four Texas school boards” filled with some illuminating points that concern me about West Virginia’s open embrace of Patriot Mobile. 
The NBC story mentioned that Patriot Mobile was strategizing back in 2022 about how to replicate their takeover of school boards and do it in more Texas counties. Are they planning to expand their influence into local and state West Virginia elections? 
Schools are already facing teacher shortages and budget shortfalls, in some parts due to a declining state population and also to the Hope Scholarship funneling money to private schools that have little accountability and are allowed to discriminate against students. I am skeptical that pushing public schools to incorporate more religious signage and teachings by getting into bed with far-right national organizations will encourage families to remain in West Virginia and reverse that population trend. 
It’s not going to stop with the In God We Trust posters. With a literal wink, Justus with First Liberty Institute offered her organization’s help to West Virginia lawmakers to get a bill passed to require the Ten Commandments be posted at schools as well. Louisiana and Texas recently passed bills to require that and it’s already been tied up in federal courts. 
The press conference itself was a mockery of what should happen at the Capitol. The banner backdrop to talking about religion in schools was filled with organization logos. Justus gave a free plug for Patriot Mobile by saying it’s her phone provider. It’s difficult to take a press conference seriously when it serves as free publicity and advertising for a telephone company. 
As West Virginia Watch pointed out, Senate President Randy Smith said that the United States “started going downhill when we took God out of our schools” and he thinks there are statistics to back that up. I would hope that he would offer them up. I also hope that our Senate president understands the difference between correlation and causation. 
Morrisey mentioned recognizing “our God” in schools. What about other religions?
It’s clear that when these people are talking about putting God “back in schools” they mean the God for one certain religion. A Christian Texas Democrat went viral when he spoke about how putting the Ten Commandments in school is an anti-Christian and a violation of the commandments themselves. His argument even seemed to persuade podcaster Joe Rogan. 
This press conference and the inevitable push to put the Ten Commandments in schools are just the latest moves in the West Virginia Legislature’s desire to make the state a less welcoming place for people who are different. I encourage West Virginians to keep an eye out for which rich, outside actors we are letting influence our lawmakers in the 2026 legislative session and beyond.

(Getty Images)When OpenAI released “study mode” in July 2025, the company touted ChatGPT’s educational benefits. “When ChatGPT is prompted to teach or tutor, it can significantly improve academic performance,” the company’s vice president of education told reporters at the product’s launch. But any dedicated teacher would be right to wonder: Is this just marketing, or does scholarly research really support such claims?
While generative AI tools are moving into classrooms at lightning speed, robust research on the question at hand hasn’t moved nearly as fast. Some early studies have shown benefits for certain groups such as computer programming students and English language learners. And there have been a number of other optimistic studies on AI in education, such as one published in the journal Nature in May 2025 suggesting that chatbots may aid learning and higher-order thinking. But scholars in the field have pointed to significant methodological weaknesses in many of these research papers.
Other studies have painted a grimmer picture, suggesting that AI may impair performance or cognitive abilities such as critical thinking skills. One paper showed that the more a student used ChatGPT while learning, the worse they did later on similar tasks when ChatGPT wasn’t available.
In other words, early research is only beginning to scratch the surface of how this technology will truly affect learning and cognition in the long run. Where else can we look for clues? As a cognitive psychologist who has studied how college students are using AI, I have found that my field offers valuable guidance for identifying when AI can be a brain booster and when it risks becoming a brain drain.
 Skill comes from effort

Cognitive psychologists have argued that our thoughts and decisions are the result of two processing modes, commonly denoted as System 1 and System 2.
The former is a system of pattern matching, intuition and habit. It is fast and automatic, requiring little conscious attention or cognitive effort. Many of our routine daily activities – getting dressed, making coffee and riding a bike to work or school – fall into this category. System 2, on the other hand, is generally slow and deliberate, requiring more conscious attention and sometimes painful cognitive effort, but often yields more robust outputs.
We need both of these systems, but gaining knowledge and mastering new skills depend heavily on System 2. Struggle, friction and mental effort are crucial to the cognitive work of learning, remembering and strengthening connections in the brain. Every time a confident cyclist gets on a bike, they rely on the hard-won pattern recognition in their System 1 that they previously built up through many hours of effortful System 2 work spent learning to ride. You don’t get mastery and you can’t chunk information efficiently for higher-level processing without first putting in the cognitive effort and strain.
I tell my students the brain is a lot like a muscle: It takes genuine hard work to see gains. Without challenging that muscle, it won’t grow bigger.
 What if a machine does the work for you?

Now imagine a robot that accompanies you to the gym and lifts the weights for you, no strain needed on your part. Before long, your own muscles will have atrophied and you’ll become reliant on the robot at home even for simple tasks like moving a heavy box.
AI, used poorly – to complete a quiz or write an essay, say – lets students bypass the very thing they need to develop knowledge and skills. It takes away the mental workout.
Using technology to effectively offload cognitive workouts can have a detrimental effect on learning and memory and can cause people to misread their own understanding or abilities, leading to what psychologists call metacognitive errors. Research has shown that habitually offloading car navigation to GPS may impair spatial memory and that using an external source like Google to answer questions makes people overconfident in their own personal knowledge and memory.
Are there similar risks when students hand off cognitive tasks to AI? One study found that students researching a topic using ChatGPT instead of a traditional web search had lower cognitive load during the task – they didn’t have to think as hard – and produced worse reasoning about the topic they had researched. Surface-level use of AI may mean less cognitive burden in the moment, but this is akin to letting a robot do your gym workout for you. It ultimately leads to poorer thinking skills.
In another study, students using AI to revise their essays scored higher than those revising without AI, often by simply copying and pasting sentences from ChatGPT. But these students showed no more actual knowledge gain or knowledge transfer than their peers who worked without it. The AI group also engaged in fewer rigorous System 2 thinking processes. The authors warn that such “metacognitive laziness” may prompt short-term performance improvements but also lead to the stagnation of long-term skills.
Offloading can be useful once foundations are in place. But those foundations can’t be formed unless your brain does the initial work necessary to encode, connect and understand the issues you’re trying to master.
 Using AI to support learning

Returning to the gym metaphor, it may be useful for students to think of AI as a personal trainer who can keep them on task by tracking and scaffolding learning and pushing them to work harder. AI has great potential as a scalable learning tool, an individualized tutor with a vast knowledge base that never sleeps.
AI technology companies are seeking to design just that: the ultimate tutor. In addition to OpenAI’s entry into education, in April 2025 Anthropic released its learning mode for Claude. These models are supposed to engage in Socratic dialogue, to pose questions and provide hints, rather than just giving the answers.
Early research indicates AI tutors can be beneficial but introduce problems as well. For example, one study found high school students reviewing math with ChatGPT performed worse than students who didn’t use AI. Some students used the base version and others a customized tutor version that gave hints without revealing answers. When students took an exam later without AI access, those who’d used base ChatGPT did much worse than a group who’d studied without AI, yet they didn’t realize their performance was worse. Those who’d studied with the tutor bot did no better than students who’d reviewed without AI, but they mistakenly thought they had done better. So AI didn’t help, and it introduced metacognitive errors.
Even as tutor modes are refined and improved, students have to actively select that mode and, for now, also have to play along, deftly providing context and guiding the chatbot away from worthless, low-level questions or sycophancy.
The latter issues may be fixed with better design, system prompts and custom interfaces. But the temptation of using default-mode AI to avoid hard work will continue to be a more fundamental and classic problem of teaching, course design and motivating students to avoid shortcuts that undermine their cognitive workout.
As with other complex technologies such as smartphones, the internet or even writing itself, it will take more time for researchers to fully understand the true range of AI’s effects on cognition and learning. In the end, the picture will likely be a nuanced one that depends heavily on context and use case.
But what we know about learning tells us that deep knowledge and mastery of a skill will always require a genuine cognitive workout – with or without AI.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In remarks to the North Carolina AFL-CIO’s annual convention, Gov. Josh Stein pushed for more affordable housing, investments in education, and greater access to child care as part of a broader effort to lower the cost of living for workers.
“Our kids and grandkids should have a brighter future than we’ve had,” Stein told the crowd of about 300 labor activists and supporters in Wilmington. “Every person should have a fair shot at success, whether it’s starting a small business or getting a good paying job, everywhere in this state, including small town North Carolina.”
He touted the state’s ranking as best in the U.S. for business as well as 26,000 new jobs and $20 billion in investments in the state this year, but said that’s not enough: “I want to make sure that we’re the best state not only for business, but also for our working families.”
“A stronger North Carolina requires that we invest in our people so that folks have the skills and knowledge to succeed in an ever-changing economy,” he said. “A stronger North Carolina supports working families struggling with the rising cost of living.”
Stein said education should not only take the form of a four-year degree, adding that his office champions apprenticeships, workforce development, and technical education. He also called for more child care seats and more home building to accommodate the influx of new residents to North Carolina, the third fastest-growing state in the country.
He called on the General Assembly to do more to support education and invest in North Carolina’s workforce.
“There’s only one state in this country where what we spend per pupil today is less than what we spent in 2002 — I’m ashamed to say it’s North Carolina,” he said. “It’s embarrassing. We have to support our educators. Teachers are the number one in-school factor of students’ success. It is long past time we gave them a real pay raise.”
Stein made similar pleas for the General Assembly to invest in public safety by raising law enforcement salaries and to protect Medicaid expansion in the state amid federal cuts to health care. He decried the Trump administration’s impact on public services, especially where veterans are concerned.

“I want to talk a moment about how the federal government has not been delivering for people. Too many federal workers are experiencing job cuts. Veterans, in particular, are being impacted by loss of services,” he said. “It’s disgraceful, and it’s not the way to treat people who dedicated themselves to serving the public.”
He said his administration launched Join NC, an initiative to recruit qualified displaced workers to join the state government, in response to the federal cuts. “Rather than turning our back on workers, we celebrate them, and we give them our respect.”
“If we are successful in achieving that goal, the goal of building a state where everyone can thrive, it will be thanks to you,” Stein said. “You keep North Carolina working. You keep North Carolina moving forward.”
North Carolina AFL-CIO president MaryBe McMillan praised Stein for pushing to taking action against foreclosure scams and prioritizing health care and education as a state senator as well as combating price gouging, opioid abuse, and voter suppression as attorney general. The NC AFL-CIO has endorsed Stein in each of his campaigns for office in North Carolina.
“We fought hard to elect Governor Stein because he has a long history of fighting for us,” McMillan said.
At the conclusion of his remarks, Stein awarded McMillan with the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, in a surprise to the union president who is set to step down this week. “Well that was a nice surprise, y’all,” McMillan said.
Gwen Mills, president of UNITE HERE, a union that primarily represents hospitality workers throughout the United States and Canada, also lauded Stein during her remarks, calling his victory “one of the brightest spots” of last year’s elections. She said, however, that the labor movement must look beyond politicians, reminding her audience that “we’re responsible for us.”
“Unions were founded as empowering institutions, not supplicants asking for permission, and confused politicians think that the economy is them — they name it after themselves, like Reaganomics or Bidenomics,” Mills said. “Workers are the economy, and we have to claim it, no matter what politicians try to name it.”
Stein also met with film industry professionals in Bespoke, a Wilmington coffee shop and bar known for its appearance in “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” primarily filmed in the city.

During the press conference, Stein announced several film grant recipients, including Season 2 of “Beast Games,” the reality competition show hosted by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, an influential YouTube personality living in Greenville.
Stein told reporters after the discussion in Bespoke that the state needs to do more to attract investment in the state from film studios, citing the economic impact to local restaurants and shops as well as to local production companies and suppliers like lumber businesses. The state enjoyed more than $302 million of direct in-state spending by the film industry in 2024.
“The most painful thing for me in recent years is that they filmed ‘Outer Banks’ in South Carolina, I mean that is ridiculous,” Stein said. “We have to be attractive enough that when you have something that is written for your state, it can be filmed in your state.”
Stein also condemned the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zaruska in Charlotte in response to a reporter’s question.
“It’s just heartbreaking. This poor young woman left a war-torn region of the world to come to North Carolina for peace and for a future, and that future was tragically stripped from her in a horrific violent assault,” he said. “We have to make sure that everybody knows that when they are in public transit, whether it’s in Charlotte, Wilmington, or anywhere, that they are going to be safe.”
He said he encouraged Charlotte mayor Vi Lyles to surge the number of law enforcement personnel on public transit in the city, commending her for doing so. He also called for greater scrutiny of how individuals with mental illness are handled both by the court system and by social services.

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia grapples with rapidly increasing energy demands and skyrocketing utility bills, a group of state lawmakers are looking deeper into energy efficiency, community solar, and energy storage.
The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation reviewed the state’s efforts to fund energy efficiency plans during virtual meetings on Wednesday. They also talked about the uncertainty around community solar investments and the rollout of energy storage plans.
Charts shared in the meeting by Carrie Hearne, the executive director of the commission, show that Virginia is 9th in electricity expenditure, which is higher than the national average. This energy use is due in part to the growing number of data centers across the state, which require large amounts of electricity. The state’s high energy expenditure also means that the cost burden for low-income households can be great.
Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy. 
“Investments in energy efficiency is a very least-cost way to save money, save electricity, save energy, and help reduce pressure on the grid,” Hearne said. 
The council also recommended the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon credits market which previously was generating funds for the state to invest in energy efficiency and flood resilience programs. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state out of RGGI, a move a judge deemed unlawful, and some lawmakers fear rejoining it will add yet another cost added onto customer’s utility bills.
“If we’re talking about affordability, anything we add to that, no matter what it is, it’s going to cost. So we need to be very careful about adding things to riders,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.
The commission expressed interest in ramping up nuclear power through small modular reactors. SMRs are not currently operating in the country, but multiple are under construction in other states. Dominion Energy has already selected their North Anna power plant as the site of their first SMR. There is still a long road ahead that will entail selecting the proposals for the projects, getting the proposer licensing, and other requirements. 
The commission did not discuss utility sized solar projects, but did discuss the status of community solar in the commonwealth. Community solar allows neighborhoods to buy into small-scale solar projects to have their utility bills reduced based on how much power is generated and how much they bought in. 
However, if Dominion’s proposed changes to the minimum bill amount materialize, it could impact those savings. There hasn’t been much movement to expand this program in Virginia, and federal grants for it have recently been paused or terminated.
The Virginia General Assembly has failed to pass bills that would expand energy storage requirements, and ones that have passed have been vetoed by Youngkin. As long-term battery technology advances, some lawmakers are pushing utilities to utilize them more to assist with storing energy from solar and wind projects.
The American Clean Power Association, which represents companies in energy storage, solar, and wind, reported to the commission that there is 56 megawatts of battery storage operational in the state now, 252MW in construction, and 94MW in the proposal stage. There are many battery storage projects in the interconnection pipeline for the regional transmission grid, PJM, to approve. Dominion has multiple pilot projects in the works that look outside lithium-ion batteries as options for their projects.
“These pilots will deliver significant value, not only for the technology developers, they get to test their systems and real world conditions, but also to us, as we help de-risk the technical performance and cost effectiveness of these proposed three (projects),” said Brandon Martin with Dominion Energy. “The real world operating data validating the technology’s ability to enhance the resiliency of the grid and those claims and the cost benefits is real.”
The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation will hold more meetings this fall to get updates on the state’s energy profile and efforts by utilities to meet the VCEA transition to renewable energy sources. They plan to have recommendations for legislation by December.

That’s the unmistakable conclusion found in recent news articles about the use – or lack thereof – of “emergency substantial risk orders,” commonly known as the red flag law.
The state’s 2020 law allows police and sheriff’s deputies to take firearms from individuals or stop them from buying guns if they are a risk to themselves or others. Yet, most localities didn’t use the law at all last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported this summer.
That inaction must change. Gun control and gun rights advocates should agree on this, even though the hardened positions that both sides exhibit on firearms prevent consensus.
Such emergency orders work. True, it’s practically impossible to prove a negative about the lives saved or grief avoided. But several academic studies have shown the effectiveness of red flag laws around the United States.
A Duke University professor estimated in 2024, for example, that one suicide could be prevented for every 17 to 23 extreme risk protection orders that are issued. Columbia University researchers used computer modeling to show Florida’s red flag law reduced firearm homicides by about 11%.
And a 2019 study by researchers at the University of California at Davis identified 21 cases in which California’s red-flag law helped prevent a mass shooting.
“The bottom line, they’re effective,” Dr. Paul Nestadt, medical director of the Center for Suicide Prevention at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, told me. He’s co-author of a report released in June that studied gun suicides across the country.
The orders also help when people fear an abusive domestic partner will use a gun against them. “It could be a lifesaving thing,” Nestadt said. Nearly two dozen states and Washington, D.C., have red flag statutes.
The law in Virginia allows prosecutors, police or sheriffs to go to court to seek an ESRO against someone. Often, family members tell authorities of concerns about their relatives, or law enforcement officials receive tips about potential threats.
Within 14 days of issuing the order, a hearing in circuit court must be held to determine whether the decision can remain in effect for up to six months. The subjects of the order are guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor for buying, possessing, or transporting a firearm during that period.
The civil process can be extended for additional time. Authorities also return firearms after the immediate threat ceases.
Fairfax County used the orders far more than any other locality in 2024 and has been a strong supporter of them. Many localities, though, didn’t have a single ESRO last year. It’s as if they don’t know how to use them or are reluctant to seize firearms from residents.
Virginia State Police told me that since the law took effect in July 2020 through Sept. 2, 2025, authorities obtained 1,994 emergency orders statewide. Fairfax County had gotten 362 of that total through July, spokespersons with the county Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney told me. The county is the state’s largest locality, with roughly 1.2 million residents.
“This tool prevents tragedy,” said Steve Descano, the county’s top prosecutor and a big proponent of the policy. “It gets guns out of people’s hands that could be a danger to others.”
The office dedicates at least four attorneys to these cases (they also handle other duties). A special court docket takes place weekly. The county has run ads about the law, and it even has a link on the commonwealth’s attorney’s website that explains the process and lists the number of cases.
Other localities, though, have rarely used the tool – if at all. Nor is it clear whether local residents know the option is available; it could be valuable when a family member is having a mental health crisis.
Portsmouth did seize firearms from a resident after the person posted images on Facebook of weapons and threatened a local Walmart. That incident had taken place shortly after the mass shooting at a Walmart in nearby Chesapeake in November 2022.
A news report said it was the only time Portsmouth, a city of about 97,000 people, had sought an order in five years.
“We know it’s not being used as often as it could and should be,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Arlington and chief sponsor of the 2020 legislation in the state House. He told me more Virginians should know about the law, including doctors, emergency room staff and mental health professionals.
One case from Crozet this year is murky, but it raises serious questions about whether law enforcement authorities should have intervened more forcefully. Family members of Justin M. Barbour had notified local officials twice in the two months leading up to his Feb. 17 shooting rampage.
The shootings outside a grocery store left three people dead, including Barbour, 28. He didn’t know his victims.
If not for the presence of an off-duty federal officer, who shot and killed Barbour, more people could’ve been harmed. Barbour fired off 28 rounds within just 20 seconds.
During several earlier interactions with police, “Barbour presented a calm demeanor,” Albemarle County Police said in a March 6 statement. “There was no indication or evidence of violence, threats, or self-harm reported to police, which are the standard threshold to obtain an ECO (Emergency Custody Order) or Emergency Substantial Risk Order (ESRO).”
News reports, though, said family members had begged for help from the Albemarle police before Barbour’s rampage. A magistrate had denied an emergency custody order sought by the family in December.
A police department spokesperson, by email, told me the department didn’t seek an ESRO in court based on its contacts with Barbour and the information it had. Relatives, under the current law, can’t go to court directly to seek such an order; they need the intervention of police or prosecutors.
Clearly, family members should have that option. Authorities, too, should err on the side of caution to prevent such horrible violence.  
The red flag law in Virginia is no panacea. Potential acts of mayhem don’t always fit neatly into the law’s guidelines.
Yet imperfect as it may be, the law helps.
Localities should use every tool that can prevent a suicide or mass shooting. The inertia must stop.

Shelley Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chairs of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, confer during a hearing about an audit of recent leasing practices by the Department of General Services. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Members of a legislative oversight committee expressed concerns Wednesday about what they see as a shift in state policy that could sharply curtail, if not end, the Department of General Services’ role in operating state government office buildings.
Members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee left the nearly three-hour hearing frustrated at a large-scale move of state offices from owned to leased space, with no documentation that the moves will save taxpayer money and are in the state’e best interests. The hearing raises the specter of potential legislation in the 2026 legislative session.
“We have a lot of follow up to do,” Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), co-chair of the committee, said after the hearing.
Solomon said he expects “a lot of additional conversations around the process when moving from ownership to lease,” making sure lawmakers and the Board of Public Works have adequate oversight and understanding of the shift. “It’s a big policy change, and I think we need to make sure that we’re doing it correctly,” he said.
General Services Secretary Atif T. Chaudry tried to assuage lawmakers’ frustrations by noting the hiring of a chief compliance officer to ensure cleaner future audits. And he told legislators his agency will work to develop a master plan for the state’s 30 million square feet of office space.

“This is the first time ever that the state is looking at all its leased and state-owned facilities holistically to make sure we as a state are spending the right resources in the right location,” Chaudhry said after the hearing. “Are we providing services in the right places?”
Chaudhry promised the plan would be “continually updated over time.”
“It’ll be a lot of work to do, but I want this to go on and sort of outlive us,” he said.
“There’s a clear … misalignment”
Wednesday’s sometimes contentious hearing followed a scathing 71-page audit that said DGS “could not support that $410.9 million in leases to relocate State agencies to downtown Baltimore were in the State’s best interest.”
Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) finalized plans to move state agencies out of a decaying Baltimore office complex, and current Gov. Wes Moore (D) has said he hopes to take advantage of a large amount of available commercial office space to negotiate “very aggressive lease rates.” Moore said those moves could save an estimated $326 million over 20- to 25-years, but auditors told lawmakers in July that they found no documentation to back up those claims.
The audit also raised significant questions about a lengthy lease for the Maryland Department of the Environment. Auditors questioned the 20-year term as well as the decision to forgo standard language that would let the state escape the lease and its annual rent increases. The report also questioned how $10 million in office improvements were rolled into the lease and how only the first-year costs of the agreement were specifically laid out to the Board of Public Works.
Chaudhry and the department rejected the report and its findings as “factually inaccurate.”
“There’s a clear … misalignment here between OLA [Office of Legislative Audits] and DGS on findings and our own assessment of things … particularly regarding the accountability mechanisms for real estate grants and construction,” said Chaudhry, who used the term “misalignment” nine times in his testimony.
More documentation “to buy my Corolla … and that’s frustrating”
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen decided to forgo a presentation of the audit in his testimony and focus instead on the lengthy DGS response to it, which accounted for half the report.

“Thirty-five pages filled with ‘not factually accurate, not factually accurate, not factually accurate,'” he said of the response. “What you do not see is one single number contradicting the specifics that we talked about.”
Tanen said he stood by the report “100% — not 99 — 100%.”
One example Tanen cited from the report was a 15-year lease at a cost of $200 million to move the Department of Health.
“We’re about to commit — not us, not the people on this committee, but my children and grandchildren — to a long-term lease,” Tanen said of that deal. But he said DGS did not provide documentation that the lease would save the state money.
“I have more documentation to support my decision to buy my Toyota Corolla than my team was able to find during the course of the audit to support a $200 million lease for the health department, and that’s frustrating,” Tanen told the committee.
Tanen, a 30-year veteran of state government, called the decision to move state government en masse to leased space “a once-in-a-lifetime, or once-in-my-career, experience, where we’re moving state agencies that historically have been in state-owned buildings. And it’s a complete change.”
“It’s the last guy’s fault”
Chaudhry testified that leases for departments moving out of the soon-to-be-vacated State Center complex were finalized under the Hogan administration, but that fell flat with Democrats and Republicans alike on the panel.
Del. Steven J. Arentz (R-Upper Shore) criticized that “it’s the last guy’s fault” defense, noting that many employees — including staff under Chaudhry — are holdovers.

“You sat back and said it was a previous administration,” Arentz said. “It’s not the previous [if] you have the same people working for you, sir, that you had before.”
Chaudhry was hired to the Maryland Department of Health during the Hogan administration, while other DGS employees were holdovers, including Wendy Scott-Napier, assistant secretary in the Office of Real Estate.
“I’m not interested in finger-pointing,” said Del. Andrea Fletcher Harrison (D-Prince George’s). “I really don’t care about what the past administration did and who did it, why they did it. What I do know is that in each level of government, regardless of who changes at the top, the majority of the people who are there have been there for years, and so they transcend administrations.”
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard), said he didn’t think the finger-pointing was “an approach that the committee really appreciated.”
“While it’s easy to kind of throw the prior administration under the bus — and I think there were a lot of things that didn’t go right then — I don’t think this is wholly under their responsibility,” Lam said. “I think there were a lot of decisions made here that were more recent than that. I’m not sure that we have better clarity in terms of steps moving forward to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
A lack of documentation
In other cases, Chaudhry said auditors didn’t ask for documentation and he contradicted auditors at the hearing who said they were never given any documentation. Solomon, in an exchange with Chaudhry, expressed frustration over a lack of documentation relating to the Health Department move.
Moving agencies out of State Center did not mean they had to move into leased properties, he said, and did not give DGS the right to not do its job and do a proper evaluation of “the cost benefit of a move versus a lease versus purchasing a new building elsewhere.”

Chaudry and his staff repeated claims of cost savings resulting from leases for departments moving out of the aging and decrepit State Center property in Baltimore. But lawmakers and the Office of Legislative Audits said they have nothing but the department’s word.
“I think what OLA is contending is that they did not find a lot of the documentation to back up a lot of those decisions,” Lam told Chaudhry . “And while you pointed out earlier that this documentation, I guess, was provided to OLA back in June of this year … in looking at Mr. Tanen, his reaction behind you, that misalignment seems like he doesn’t believe that they received that documentation.”
A three-page analysis of the health department move was eventually provided to the audit committee late Tuesday night. But committee members said it did not explain how the 15-year lease was cheaper for the state than purchasing and renovating another building.
A “workaround” for renovation costs
Also drawing scrutiny from the committee was the Department of the Environment’s  20-year lease at Montgomery Park in Baltimore. The deal — a renewal of an existing lease — locks the state in for two decades with no ability to terminate for convenience, a standard in most state leases.
In addition to a higher base lease rate and automatic increases, the lease included $10 million of renovation costs, including new cubicles. The costs of the work will be amortized over the life of the lease.
In its response to auditors, the department justified the adding the renovation costs into the lease because “the agency was unable to consider directly paying $10 million to reimburse the landlord for renovation costs due to budget constraints. The agency did not have a capital improvement budget available to support this expense but only had operating budget funds established in accordance with the prior lease.”
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) said adding $10 million of renovations to a lease was “a workaround” to avoid the standard capital budget request process. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
Lam balked at the department’s reasoning.
“It seems like this is a workaround on the part of the department and the agencies that are your clients to be able to get the renovations that they want without having to go through the regular capital process,” Lam said.
Chaudhry responded that it was common to ask a landlord for renovations and include them in the cost of the lease.
“I would say that this is actually industry best practices, and this is a very good way to aggressively negotiate lease rates so we are able to pay fair-market rates for leases, or below fair-market rates, the rates and allow the landlord to build, to spend the money to build out the space for exact specifications,” he said.
Chaudhry, during and after the meeting, said the statement his department provided to the auditors was “taken out of context.”
Auditors published the statement as provided without additional comment.
After the meeting, Chaudhry said the “audit team” had taken the statement out of context.
But when asked if the department could have provided a better answer, Scott-Napier interjected saying, “We could have.”
Chaudhry then spoke over her.
“I think it’s a misalignment between OLA and DGS, and what I mean by that is they take information and they run with it, not being real estate experts,” Chaudhry said.
“Well, we are answering these questions and coordinating with them, with a lens of the real estate experts,” he said. “And I think part of that is translation, right? Translating into layman’s terms to be able to translate so non-real-estate experts can understand where we are coming from.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_2657-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 05:56:16.188258

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With recent legislation updating Maine’s definition of neglect so that it can no longer be confused with poverty, child welfare officials are working on ways to take the change beyond semantics. But they are finding a challenge in ensuring all mandated reporters are up to speed. 
“It’s not just a change in statute. It’s actually a change in practice and that’s what we want to see happening in the field, on the ground when we’re working with families,” said Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services. 
In June, Gov. Janet Mills signed legislation to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty. The proposal had an emergency preamble, so it took effect immediately upon her signature.
The updated definition distinguishes between whether a parent or caregiver is willfully withholding a child’s essential needs and their financial ability to provide them. Johnson spoke with the Maine Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday about the ways her agency is trying to bring that distinction into practice. 
Johnson said her staff reviewed current child welfare policies and practices for areas that need updated language, further changes or additional guidance to be in line with the new definition. The agency has held town halls for staff to ask questions about the policy change, she added.
Gap in Maine’s mandated reporter law raises questions about accountability for missed reports

She also said mandated reporter training materials have been updated to include information about the change and scenarios of poverty that wouldn’t rise to the updated standards for neglect. For example, a child disclosing that there isn’t enough food at home or becoming unhoused because their caregivers can’t afford to pay rent. 
Mandated reporters are a usual conduit between children who are abused or neglected and the state’s child welfare system. State law requires professionals who are likely to come in contact with infants and other children to alert the appropriate authorities of potential abuse or neglect.
However, mandated reporters are only required by law to be trained once every four years, so Johnson said the agency is faced with a challenge of making sure that reporters who aren’t scheduled to reup their training are aware of the new law.
There are thousands of mandated reporters in the state, such as teachers and medical providers, but Johnson said her agency doesn’t keep a roster of them all. Instead, she said they can send information to schools, medical practices and other social services agencies that employ mandated reporters and ask them to share that information. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York), who is a former educator, asked Johnson about reaching out to the state Department of Education about an updated training, which she said they are looking into.
Rep. Lucien Daigle (R-Fort Kent), who has been a dentist for over 40 years, said he worked for an organization that did a virtual mandated reporter training annually. Though it was redundant when there weren’t changes to the law, he said refreshing that knowledge every year was important.

Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that the bill would honor the Wisconsinites who have died by suicide including former Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, who killed himself in 2024. 
“We all deserve to live free from the fear of gun violence — whether that be in public or in the comfort of our homes. Last year, many of us in the Capitol lost a dear friend in Jonathan Brostoff, and there are many more people around the state who died by suicide using a gun,” Roys said in a statement. “It is our hope that we can honor their memories by offering a helping hand to anyone who is struggling with thoughts of self-harm.” 
The lawmakers said the bill is picking up on the work of Brostoff, who was an advocate for improving access to mental health services. During his time in the Legislature, Brostoff also served as a member of the 2019 Speakers’ Task Force on Suicide Prevention.
Lawmakers, many of whom served with him, honored him on the floor of the Legislature earlier this year. 
After Brostoff’s death, Gov. Tony Evers called on lawmakers to pass a similar policy.
“A big part of preventing gun suicide is access to intervention: the time and space between the person and the firearm are crucial,” the lawmakers said in a memo. 
According to a 2025 report from the The Center for Gun Violence Solutions and The Center for Suicide Prevention at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, gun-related suicides in the U.S. reached record highs in 2023 with 27,300 — or 58% — of all gun deaths being suicides; 90% of suicide attempts involving guns are fatal.
The Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) would be required to maintain a list under the bill. The proposal would provide $150,000 in state funding to the Department of Justice for the purposes of maintaining the list. 
A person would be able to request a prohibition for one year, five years with the first year being irrevocable or a 20-year period with the first year being irrevocable. 
The prohibition could be removed if someone submitted a request to the DOJ outside of the irrevocable period. After receiving a request for the revocation of a prohibition, the DOJ would have to wait 48 hours to remove the person from the database. 
Snodgrass said in a statement that people experiencing suicidal ideation need ways to protect themselves. 
“A constituent came to me in a time of crisis, feeling helpless that when they hoped to add themselves to a ‘do not sell’ list, found there was no process and no such list,” Snodgrass said. “Thankfully, my constituent is thriving today and we are grateful for their advocacy on this issue to help save lives in the future.”
A “Do Not Sell” list — also known as a ‘Voluntary Prohibition of Handgun Purchases’ list — has been adopted in a handful of other states, including Washington, Utah and Virginia. Reporting from The Trace in 2024 found that within the six years only about 130 people had participated in the program.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire has been slower than the rest of New England to lean into renewable electricity generation, including through solar power. And while some opportunities to change that will likely arise during the upcoming legislative session, it’s not yet clear whether lawmakers will have an appetite to pursue them.
Some clean energy advocates view expanding solar as an accessible route toward more widespread renewable energy capacity in New Hampshire, said Sen. David Watters, a Democratic member of the state Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee since 2019.
“Solar is kind of the low-hanging fruit if we want to do something about renewable energy and reducing costs for New Hampshire people,” he said.
Yet, in New Hampshire, approximately 2% of electricity was generated through solar power as of spring 2025 — far less than the other New England states’ average of about 15%, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
“The climate’s the same as in all the neighboring states, of course,” said Dan Weeks, vice president of business development at ReVision Energy, a solar system installer that operates across northern New England. What’s different, then, he and others said, is New Hampshire policymakers’ historic reticence around the development of solar infrastructure.
Divided on incentives
Part of that stems from an overarching debate in the New Hampshire solar landscape: To what extent should the state encourage solar development through subsidies and other incentives?
Some consider such pro-solar measures counterproductive for ratepayers and, therefore, not worth the investment, said Rep. Michael Vose, a Republican from Epping who chairs the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee. Vose said he would not abide by proposals to implement ratepayer-borne subsidies when electricity costs in New England are already among the highest in the contiguous U.S. 
“Those subsidies come from ratepayers,” he said. “To keep (electricity) as affordable as possible is an imperative … so we have resisted the temptation to overspend on energy subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency, in order to keep our rates lower.”
Concerns that solar development unfairly shifts a cost burden onto ratepayers are not new. Former Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed multiple proposed expansions to net metering, a program through which energy customers who own generation equipment are reimbursed for the electricity they generate at their property. In a 2019 veto message, Sununu called that program regressive and outlined concerns it would raise rates for those who did not engage in the program. He expressed similar concerns after vetoing another expansion bill in 2023.
A 2022 study on the effects of net metering in New Hampshire, conducted by Montreal-based consulting firm Dunsky Energy + Climate Advisors, concluded that the practice would cause an increase of about 1% to the energy bills of customers who do not use net metering – about $1.70 per month for a family paying a typical monthly electric bill of $170.
And solar advocates say the increased uptake of solar has a longer-term benefit to all consumers across the network that outweighs that amount.
A healthy base of solar capacity can reduce the load on the electrical grid at times of peak use, such as hot summer days when air conditioning units are working overtime, Weeks said. At those times, solar arrays’ productivity and peak regional energy demand is typically aligned, correlated to the hottest times of day.
The result is a solar buffer that can help protect the grid from hitting the ceiling of peak demand, at which time electric providers must switch on expensive, emergency power stations to feed the grid. The cost of electricity climbs steeply when demand is highest, Weeks said. But solar can help stave off those emergency measures.
This principle was particularly visible in New England this June, when a buffer from behind-the-meter solar — meaning arrays installed at the site of use, such as residential rooftop panels — saved consumers an estimated $8.2 million in peak electricity pricing on one particularly hot day, according to a report by renewable energy advocacy nonprofit The Acadia Center.
Most of the solar panels in existence across New Hampshire are residential solar panels and other small arrays. In some cases, Watters said, this may be because groups looking to develop larger projects have taken them to neighboring states where more incentives are available.
Vose said the reason that new energy projects were not arriving in New Hampshire was multifaceted and pointed to the high cost of construction in New England generally.
“It’s a difficult environment to make money,” Vose said.
He also pointed to past measures he said were intended to encourage energy development in the state – such as House Bill 609, signed by Sununu in July 2024, which streamlined the site approval process for proposed energy projects.
“Unfortunately, it hasn’t been tested yet, because there haven’t been any projects proposed,” he said.
Vose also said he did not expect to see the Republican-majority House reconsider their stance on solar subsidies or other incentives in the near future.
New Hampshire Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis said New Hampshire’s comparative lack of solar was due to the state not courting developers as aggressively as neighboring states. But as those governments back off on their own subsidies and incentives, he said, New Hampshire may be well poised to take advantage of the market and develop its own infrastructure with direct investment from ratepayers.
Budget cuts and dwindling funds
The amount of funding available for all renewable energy projects in New Hampshire has diminished greatly over the course of the past year.
Just this July, the New Hampshire Department of Energy received notice that the $43.5 million the state was set to receive through the federal “Solar for All” program had been rescinded. The funds were part of a nationwide program that was, until its termination, set to disburse about $7 billion in already promised funding to 60 organizations including states and tribes. The funds were earmarked to help bring solar energy projects to low-income households.
Plans for New Hampshire’s portion of the funds included adding community solar projects and collectively owned solar arrays statewide, including projects for manufactured housing parks, publicly owned housing, and workforce housing sites, according to an April 2024 press release from the New Hampshire Department of Energy. The New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and New Hampshire Community Loan Fund were sub-grantees in the project.
In the release, Rob Dapice, New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority executive director, said he expected the project to reduce utility costs for residents and housing developers alike.
The New Hampshire Department of Energy appealed the grant’s termination to the EPA, Deputy Commissioner Christopher Ellms said in an email to the Bulletin on Sept. 5. In the dispute, dated Aug. 28, Division of Policy and Programs Director Joshua Elliott called the termination “arbitrary and capricious” and requested the funds be restored.
Other federal cuts under the Trump administration have also diminished the amount of funds available for renewable energy projects, including the termination of the residential clean energy credit, which reimbursed homeowners up to 30% of the cost of a qualifying renewable energy project for their home but is set to end Dec. 31.
And at the state level, the budget bill signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in August will transfer the millions of dollars accrued in New Hampshire’s renewable energy fund — and all incoming revenue — to the general fund over the next two years. As a result, about $15 million otherwise earmarked for clean energy and energy efficiency development across the state will be sent to the general fund for use elsewhere, leaving about $1 million per year available in the fund for investing in renewable energy.
Looking ahead
Though legislators and advocates said they did not expect sweeping solar policy developments to find traction in the next legislative session, some more incremental developments may be on the horizon.
One of those includes a possible bill to streamline the adoption of so-called plug-in, or balcony, solar, said Watters. These portable solar panels can be less expensive than traditional rooftop arrays, and plug directly into a socket. Watters said he was considering legislation to help chart a more straightforward path for New Hampshire residents to put the technology to use.
“The technology is there. There’s a lot of good devices that people can buy,” Watters said. “…If they’re potentially a renter, or are in a situation where they can’t do rooftop, this is a possibility for some solar development.”
Battery technology is another arm of the solar industry developing rapidly in neighboring states, said Weeks. Batteries installed along with solar panels allow residents to save surplus power they generate rather than feeding it directly to the grid; through agreements with utilities, this power can sometimes be tapped into in times of peak demand to further stave off the need for emergency plants, Weeks said.
“These programs have been shown to save all ratepayers, whether you have solar or not, a lot of money,” he said.
Residents with battery systems in place may be able to benefit further through a bill Vose said he was considering that would allow users to be reimbursed through net metering for the power stored in their batteries in addition to the power generated in real time through their panels.
Net metering itself is another matter advocates hope the state will take up once again in the upcoming session.
When New Hampshire’s net metering rules were last updated in 2017, Weeks said, they allowed for projects to be guaranteed participation in net metering through 2040. But as time goes on and that deadline nears, uncertainty has grown about the future of the program — and that, Weeks said, could put would-be developers on edge.
“With each passing year, the time horizon is shorter and shorter, down to 15 years now, and that is also discouraging investment in solar,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/solarqueue-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-11 05:56:16.188258

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)With less than a week before the Annapolis primary election, Democratic mayoral candidates Rhonda Pindell Charles and Jared Littmann presented their cases during a debate Wednesday on why they should be the next mayor of Annapolis.
The winner in Tuesday’s primary election will face Republican Bob O’Shea, who has no primary challenger but still participated in Wednesday’s debate at the Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis. They are running to replace Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two four-year terms.
While he faces no primary challenge, O’Shea will face a challenge in the Nov. 4 general election in a city where registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by a more than 2-1 ratio.
“I believe that everybody should have an opportunity, and I also believe in tough love,” said O’Shea, a local businessman who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2013 and state delegate in 2018. “Tough love is something that when someone does something, you scare them a little bit to not do it again.”
While O’Shea announce this summer, Littman got an almost two-year head start on the race, announcing his candidacy in January 2024. Pindell Charles officially announced her candidacy in September of last year.
The debate, hosted by the nonpartisan Action Annapolis, provided the candidates with questions in advance on quality of life, housing and improvement of city services.
Different responses came up when all three candidates were asked: “As mayor, what would you do differently from current and past administrations?”

Littmann, a small business owner who manages K&B Ace Hardware in the city with his wife, said he would like to instill a culture of customer service.
“Our city government needs to have that same sort of culture where we’re resident-focused,” said Littmann, who served on the city council for five years before his term ended in 2017.
“So often I hear complaints that it took me so long to get a response,” he said. “That’s not good customer service.”
O’Shea said he would ensure the city conducts shared services with Anne Arundel County and the state. In addition, he would “reduce redundancy,” making cuts at the administrative level and “not in the people that do the jobs.”
Pindell Charles, who has served as alderwoman on the city council since 2009, defended and supported the current and previous administrations and city workers. She also said the city already does shared services, or partnerships, such as public safety and procurement with the county.
“We have three stellar bond ratings and I think we [should] be proud of that,” Pindell Charles said. “Nevertheless, we need more focus on our working class and on our public and subsidized housing…  There’s always more to do.”
Among the written questions from the audience was whether the candidates would support legislation to install cameras in high-crime neighborhoods, and impose a financial penalty on property owners for nonworking cameras.
All three candidates support cameras in various communities, as long it can be done legally.
Pindell Charles said the financial penalty “could be something that’s definitely looked” into.
Littmann, who said he has cameras inside and outside his business, isn’t “too crazy about the idea of fining people for not putting up cameras … We have so many restrictions on businesses. Cameras are expensive. Maintaining them is expensive.”
O’Shea said property owners shouldn’t be the only ones to face a penalty.
“If you’re going to fine people because their camera isn’t working or there’s an issue whether you don’t have them up, those city cameras should also have some sort of penalty if they’re not working properly,” he said. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”
Polls for the Sept. 19 primary election will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Win McNamee/Getty ImagesDonald Trump’s appointee as secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has set out to dismantle an Atlanta-based institution, attempting to transform the Centers for Disease Control, the planet’s pre-eminent public-health agency, into the Centers for Deluded Conspiracy, an official purveyor of pseudo-science and quackery.
And those with the power to stop Kennedy’s assault on the CDC lack the courage and wisdom to do so, while those who do have the courage to act lack the power to intervene. As a result, we are witnessing a tragedy play out before our eyes that will have consequences for decades.
If that sounds alarmist, let’s review who we’re dealing with in Kennedy.  
In the not-too-distant past, he has suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic was a “plandemic,” created by the pharmaceutical industry to drum up business for itself, with the CDC serving as the industry’s enforcer. It’s a familiar line of thinking for Kennedy, an echo of his earlier conspiracy theory that the attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001 may have plotted by the U.S. defense industry so it could keep selling arms and munitions.
Kennedy has said that there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. He has said that the polio vaccine has killed more people than it has saved. He has suggested that COVID-19 was “targeted” to kill certain ethnic groups, such as white and Black people, while making Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese immune. He also insists that vaccines and Tylenol cause autism, theories that are utterly without scientific basis.
Trump himself, the man who suggested that we could fight COVID by injecting bleach into our veins or letting the sun shine into places in our body where God did not intend the sun to shine, posted a vaccine-related meme this week on his Truth Social account claiming that “They’re ALL poison. Every. Single. One.”
Given their unquestioning faith in their leader, a lot of Trump supporters will probably be even more reluctant now to be vaccinated, or to allow their children to do so, and that will have consequences for them. But again, when powerful national leaders make health care policy based on such nonsense, even those of us who know better will pay a heavy price.
Living and working in Atlanta, I’ve met a lot of CDC employees. They are smart, they are honest, they are dedicated to science and to the mission of public health. Many have sacrificed more lucrative career paths because they wanted to be at the CDC, where so much important work was being done.
Imagine being someone like that and you’re told that to keep your job you have to pretend that vaccines do more damage than good, and other such nonsense. For a lot of CDC employees, they don’t have to imagine that scenario because they are living it.
In recent testimony to the U.S. Senate, Kennedy was asked why he had just fired Susan Monarez as CDC director, after just four weeks in the job.
“I told her that she had to resign because when I asked her whether she was a trustworthy person, and she said no,” Kennedy told the senators.
Somehow, I doubt that’s how the conversation actually went down. It seems far more likely that Kennedy asked Monarez whether she could be trusted to spew the pseudo-science that Kennedy demanded. When she refused, as integrity demanded, she was fired.
Monarez holds a doctorate in immunology and microbiology, with a long career of research into infectious diseases and other public-health issues. Her replacement as acting director of the CDC, Jim O’Neill, has a master’s degree in the humanities, but apparently Kennedy considers him “trustworthy.”
It’s easy to see why. Like Kennedy, O’Neill champions the use of ivermectin, a horse dewormer, to treat COVID. He believes that the government should allow the sale of unproved drugs and other treatments so that people can experiment on their own to find out if they work or not. Yeah, they may die unnecessarily, but it’s not the government’s job to protect them from such choices.
There have always been people who prefer to live in an alternate reality of their own design, as Kennedy, O’Neill and others do. We saw that at the peak of the pandemic, when some individuals stubbornly rejected the vaccine and medical science in favor of quack remedies such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. 
It was their choice, and many died as a result. 
But now, in our era of national madness, we have surrendered control of major agencies of the federal government to such people, not just at the CDC but at the Pentagon, the Department of State, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice. 
Now all of us are living in their alternate reality. Now all of us are at risk when actual reality reasserts itself, as it always does eventually. We can’t know what form that challenge will take, but we do know it will come, and the charlatans and conspiracy fools that we now have in charge will prove spectacularly unfit to meet it.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)Ohio’s workers have seen a lot of changes in the last 25 years, according to a recent report by a state policy think tank, but those changes haven’t always been good for them.
Policies have favored “loopholes for the wealthiest and corporations, instead of policies that build the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up,” Policy Matters Ohio Researcher Heather Smith wrote in this year’s analysis.
In Policy Matters Ohio’s latest State of Working Ohio report, researchers review the last quarter-century in honor of the think tank’s founding.
The first State of Working Ohio report in 1999 showed a falling median wage, and workers who were producing more but being paid less than their parents in the previous 20 years.
Since 1999, the economy for workers in Ohio has shown disparities for men and women, people of color, and people of different education levels.
For instance, Black Ohioans saw the highest unemployment rates of any group in the state last year, an increase of nearly 4%.

Compared to 1999, the average Ohio worker does see more than $4 more in inflation-adjusted wages, and unemployment was the same in 2024 as it was in 1999, at 4.3%.
However, the employed population share dropped from 64% to 59.9% in the last 25 years, according to Policy Matters data.
The 2025 report attributed a focus from elected leaders on “‘business-friendly’ policies” as a reason for many of the changes to the economic outlook for Ohio workers, particularly a loss of opportunities for working Ohioans over the decades.
In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act was passed by a Republican U.S. Senate, a Democratic U.S. House, and signed by President Ronald Reagan, which included tax cuts for high income levels.
In 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed in Congress with most Republicans voting yes and Democrats deeply divided, and signed by President Bill Clinton, which led to outsourcing of jobs.
The report stated those policy choices, among others, hit directly at Ohio’s manufacturing industry, with the number of jobs in that sector decreasing by more than 30%.
“Between 2005 and 2019, General Motors moved or eliminated an estimated 8,245 jobs in favor of cheaper imports and low-wage foreign labor, harming thousands of workers in Lordstown alone,” Smith wrote in the report.
In the present day, Smith argued in the report, “Ohio’s leaders are now banking on mega-development deals to grow our economy, diverting resources to incentivize corporate investments, with a reckless disregard for accountability.”
“Headlines and some politicians over the last several years have championed these deals as signs Ohio is on the rebound,” the report stated. “However, the data show job growth and recession recovery has been concentrated in two regions in Ohio, and largely in central Ohio.”
The report referenced the Intel plan in Jersey Township, a semiconductor manufacturing project which has been delayed several times by the corporation.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno even called for a fraud investigation against the company because of the delays.
President Donald Trump blamed the struggles of the company on “bad management” as he announced a $9 billion investment to give the federal government a 10% stake in the company.
The Jersey Township plant was expected to be completed this year, but has now been set for a completion date in the 2030s.

“This has never happened in our country before. We have had periods of voluntary departure, but not self-deportations under pressure like this,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
In a June report Chishti wrote for the institute, he said the “self-deportation” strategy by the Trump administration is perhaps an acknowledgement that its goal of 1 million deportations a year “might be impossible through immigration enforcement alone, no matter how muscular.”
Immigration arrests fell in August compared with July and have not been close to a stated administration goal of 3,000 a day.
It’s hard to document how many immigrants might be choosing to leave under pressure from the Trump administration. Thousands have shown a new interest in leaving on social media, in court and through a new government app offering a plane ticket and $1,000 for those without legal immigration status. Trump officials have touted a drop in the immigrant population this year as a sign of success, but researchers say fear of responding to surveys may play a role in the data.
ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

A 22-year-old Oklahoma woman, brought to the U.S. as a child, told Stateline she’s leaving for her native Mexico on a flight this month to start a new life.
Living in Mexico may be hard, but the threat of arrest and detention after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed, giving extra funding for immigration enforcement, was too much for her.
“It’s tough. I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known. I speak Spanish, but not the best. My thoughts are in English. I have to readapt to everything,” she said.
“More than anything, I’m tired of being called a criminal here,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, fearing interference with her flight.
“I was in leadership in high school. I was in the marching band. I have a college degree here. I am not a criminal, and this is not OK, what’s happening now,” said the woman, who said her parents brought her at the age of 6 on a tourist visa.
She didn’t qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, because her family took her on trips back to Mexico, she said, returning on new tourist visas.
“I am 22 years old now and undocumented,” she said, “I can’t speak to my parents’ actions. I know there’s issues with legality in that and they made choices that were not favorable. I was a child.”










I’m leaving behind an entire life here, everyone I know, everything I’ve ever known.


– A 22-year-old woman brought to the U.S. as a child who’s moving to Mexico


Discussions abound on Reddit, an online chat site, about whether to take a government offer to leave or continue to face the threat of arrest and detention if not deportation.
“After over 20 years of living here illegally (I was brought here as a toddler) I think now is finally the time to throw in the towel. I simply do not belong in the US nor am I wanted here,” one man, who said he was born in Mexico, wrote this month in a chat group for Mexican expatriates.
“I’ve worked in construction a large part of my adult life so I have some money saved up, but no career,” he added. “I just feel tired of not being able to do anything meaningful with my life here. I can’t get a driver’s license. I have no hope of ever retiring when I grow old and I can’t even get a real job.”
The Trump administration is using a “potent combination of carrots and sticks” to encourage immigrants without legal status to leave, according to the Migration Policy Institute report. High-profile arrests at workplaces, homes, court hearings and even citizenship interviews have “generated intense nervousness” while poor conditions in detention centers and the threat of removal to unknown countries create “a palpable fear of arrest,” the report stated.
The Department of Homeland Security has a cellphone app — called CBP Home — that offers a plane ticket and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” wishing to leave. The department told Stateline, in a statement attributed only to a senior official, that “tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app” but did not provide further detail.
Firefighters question leaders’ role in Washington immigration raid

Thousands more people have accepted voluntary departure rather than fight immigration court cases and take a chance on arrest and detention. The Pew Research Center found that the overall immigrant population dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million in June, though the change could be due partly to a heightened fear of responding to surveys among immigrants.
In another sign of increased appetite for leaving the country, a social media group helping such people decide has seen soaring membership.
The group, Onward, was started by three DACA recipients who moved abroad during the first Trump administration. It has seen 10,000 join requests this year, more than triple the interest it’s had previously in its four years of existence, said Jason Hong, a founding member. Hong was born in South Korea, brought to the U.S. as a child, grew up in New Jersey, and has opted to live in Spain. There, he is a legal resident and has an opportunity for Spanish citizenship. U.S. citizenship wasn’t an option under DACA.
“If I want to shoot for citizenship here, I can,” Hong said. “For the time being I want to focus on helping others who are making the same decision.”
Another Onward founder, Monsy Hernández, left South Carolina during the first Trump administration in 2017, settling in Germany.
“I was very traumatized with the discrimination I faced in the United States when my mom was put into one of the ICE detention centers. I just wanted to go somewhere where no one knew that I was Mexican,” Hernández said. “I thought, OK, if I’m in Germany, I will be very, very far away from that discrimination.”
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, despite court setbacks

Widespread departure of immigrants is almost unprecedented in the U.S. history, Chishti said, though there was a large-scale return of Italian immigrants in the 19th century. They were known in Italy as “ritornati” — a wave of farmers and laborers who arrived here when work was scarce in their home country, then returned home with their savings after a few years, when economic conditions in Italy improved.
More recently, some people from Mexico returned home when work dried up during the 2008 Great Recession.
But the current departures under pressure and threats from the U.S. government seems to be unprecedented, Chishti said. In some cases, parents have been pressured to leave the country or face separation from their children.
Voluntary departure is also an option to settle immigration court cases, and more people are taking that route. In those cases, immigrants must pay their own way and can’t have a conviction for a serious crime. Choosing voluntary departure can get immigrants released from detention and avoid a removal order that could cause them to be permanently barred from returning.
According to federal statistics obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Stateline, 6,118 people were granted voluntary departure between Jan. 20 and July 29, the latest figures available, compared with 2,550 for the same time period last year during the Biden administration. For both years, the majority of cases involved citizens of Mexico returning to Mexico.

(Photo courtesy of Ash Hebert)Penobscot County, Maine, is grappling with the largest HIV outbreak in the state’s history. Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
An HIV outbreak
The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.
The future of harm reduction
Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

Clearing encampments
Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
‘I’m still alive’
Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.
“That’s how this outbreak has been spreading more and more,” Jason said. “Every time we turn around there’s another case.”

(Google Data Centers)
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is giving American Electric Power the green light to start charging data centers differently. The decision is another acknowledgement of the strain large energy consumers are placing on the grid.
In a press release, the Ohio Consumer’s Counsel praised the commission for ensuring data centers “pay their own way.”
The PUCO’s latest decision set aside an appeal brought by tech interests like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft as well as the Ohio Manufacturers Association. But that might not be the final word.
The deep-pocketed companies fueling Ohio’s data center boom can still appeal to the state supreme court. The Ohio Manufacturer’s Association is already promising to do so, saying the recent ruling leaves them “no choice.”
Case background
In May of last year, AEP applied with the PUCO to establish a new tariff for data centers.
In the energy context, a tariff is the contract for service outlining what’s expected of the supplier and the customer.
AEP, for instance, has different tariffs for all sorts of customers like schools, churches, fairs, automakers, and more.
From the company’s point of view, a separate set of rules for data centers is just one more example, and entirely appropriate given the unique demands data centers impose.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In its decision, the PUCO leaned heavily on testimony from AEP officials like Vice President of Transmission Planning and Analysis Kamran Ali.
He explained in 2023, Central Ohio accounted for 4,000 MW of the state’s roughly 9,400 MW peak load.
Ali testified by 2030, the company has signed agreements to connect another 4,000 MW — or the entire current Central Ohio energy demand — from data centers alone.
What’s more, there are another 30,000 MW worth of proposed projects hoping to get online.
In its application, AEP said it was “resolute and unwavering in its conclusion that an updated set of terms and conditions for retail service to data center customers is needed in order to move forward with capacity expansion plans on a just and reasonable basis.”
AEP’s initial proposal applied to data centers using more than 25 MW a month.
The company asked that data center customers should be subject to a billing minimum, and a ‘load ramp’ that would increase year to year as facility gets up to speed.
AEP also proposed and an exit fee if the data center decided to pull up stakes before their contract expires.
The motivation for all those conditions, AEP said, was to ensure they’re not on the hook if a proposed data center never materializes, and infrastructure investments are borne by “those that caused the need,” rather than getting spread across the rest of AEP’s consumers.

Several tech and manufacturing interests aligned around a counterproposal that lumped data centers in with other energy intensive customers but pushed the minimum demand threshold up to 50 MW.
Among other changes, the proposal dialed back billing minimums, offered a gentler ramp up period, and made it easier for companies to exit.
The PUCO decided to go with a version of AEP’s proposal negotiated with the Ohio Consumers Counsel and a handful of other interests instead.
Following that decision in July, PUCO Chair Jennifer French said, “Today’s order represents a well-balanced package that safeguards non-data center customers on an industrial and residential level while establishing a dependable and reasonable environment for data centers to continue to thrive within Ohio.”
The appeal and what’s next
Early last month, data center interests petitioned the PUCO to take a second look.
In its filing, the Data Center Coalition argued the PUCO-approved settlement “is a knee-jerk, reactive response to the surge of data center interest,” that unlawfully discriminates against data centers based on their line of business.
The group added AEP never presented formal studies to back up claims that the new tariff would ensure the users driving demand bear the actual cost of infrastructure upgrades.
But the PUCO batted away those arguments as already asked and answered. The commission reiterated its determination that “actual, material differences” in the service that data centers support a separate tariff.
With 30,000 MW of potential data center demand in the offing, PUCO added, “there is a timely need for a proactive solution to address potential reliability issues in the AEP Ohio central Ohio region, which is specifically driven by data centers.”
Ohio Consumer’s Counsel Maureen Willis applauded the PUCO “for standing up for AEP’s consumers instead of giving into the demands of power-hungry data centers.”
But perhaps underscoring the unlikely partnership with AEP, Willis added her office isn’t giving the utility a free pass.
She said they’re investigating AEP’s pending rate case, “where the utility’s infrastructure investment has nearly doubled in just five years, contributing to rising bills for Ohio families. We urge the PUCO to continue to focus on fair cost allocation and affordability in that case.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to several parties in the case about whether they plan to appeal.
Data Center Coalition Director of Energy Policy Lucas Fykes said they’re still “reviewing our options.”
“As DCC indicated throughout the proceeding,” he added, “the data center industry is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses,” and that they’d work on “evidence-based solutions” to support data center development.
The Ohio Manufacturer’s Association, however, came out swinging.
“It’s disappointing,” OMA said in a statement, “that the PUCO decided to uphold discriminatory tariffs on energy-intensive users, creating a slippery slope for utilities to potentially punish industrial and other high-energy users.”
OMA insisted PUCO’s rationale was “deeply flawed, based upon overstated and double-counted speculative load by AEP.”
The organization said it has no choice but to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio will continue promoting the benefits of vaccines and supporting vaccinations, despite some Republican leaders casting doubt on their legitimacy and Florida making an effort to ban requirements.
Gov. Mike DeWine and Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff will continue following the decades of science that show vaccines are safe, DeWine’s team said.
The percentage of kids starting kindergarten with their vaccinations continues to decline on a state and national level for diseases like diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, mumps and polio.
In the 2019-2020 school year, vaccination rates were at 89.9%, Vanderhoff said. Those numbers are now down to 85.4%, a 4.5% decrease over five years.
But state Rep. Beth Liston’s family is not one of the overall vaccine rate decreases.
“I get my kids every vaccine available,” Liston (D-Dublin) said.
She is a pediatrician and is worried about anti-vaccine rhetoric across the country.
“There are a lot of diseases that we can prevent, and a lot of health problems, including death, that… would have come from that, had we not had vaccines,” Liston said.
In a congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he believes that many vaccines cause harm, an argument refuted by medical experts. He has also pulled funding from vaccine development and fired CDC officials.
“We are the sickest country in the world; that’s why we have to fire people at the CDC,” RFK Jr. said. “They did not do their job. This was their job, to keep us healthy.”
The “Make America Healthy Again” campaign is also at work in Ohio. House Bill 112 would make it illegal to discriminate against someone who refuses to get a vaccine. The sponsors said they could not go on camera to speak about it, but sponsor Rep. Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester) introduced the same bill last year.
“Ohioans are being forced to put aside their conscientious or religious beliefs or face the reality that they may be unable to operate as productive members of our state, face job loss or denial of education or job training,” Gross said in 2024.
Other sponsor state Rep. Beth Lear gave us a comment, saying, “When states, including Ohio, began mandating untested and unproven mRNA shots as a condition of employment and education, I and many others around the state and nation awoke to the massive government overreach that was taking place.”
Doctors have continuously argued that the COVID-19 vaccine was tested and proven to work and be safe.
“If vaccines are truly safe and effective, then they will be in high demand and there is no need for mandates,” Lear said.
Misinformation leads to a lack of demand, Liston said.
Gross also posted on social media that she supported Florida’s new effort to ban all vaccine mandates, including for children. Lear said she agreed.
The roadblock for the vaccination bill will likely be the governor. DeWine has been a longtime supporter of vaccines and the welfare of children. He has previously vetoed legislation he deemed to be against public health.
California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii have formed a coalition to provide “credible information” and combat the Trump administration. Northeastern states, like Massachusetts, have started working together on their own coalition, as well, according to Gov. Maura Healey.
“While the state does get involved in compacts from time to time, and certainly, we coordinated with states during the pandemic on certain things… We did things the Ohio way and put out Ohio recommendations.” DeWine’s spokesperson, Dan Tierney, said Monday.
Thus, Ohio will not be joining the Democrat-run states’ coalitions.
“You tend to hear about Ohio politicians wanting to do things the ‘Ohio way’ and not necessarily joining and superseding and watering down the power of Ohioans by putting this authority into a multi-state conglomerate,” Tierney added.
Science shouldn’t be a partisan issue, Liston said.
“We all want kids to be healthy; we all want us to use the best evidence in society to have better health outcomes,” Liston said. “I think it’s unfortunate that there’s been division and mistrust.”

Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, is up in 18 states.  (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Poverty dropped last year nationwide and in 38 states, according to census estimates released today.
But since that decrease was recorded in mid-2024, more people have signed up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, in 18 states and the District of Columbia. In those places, more people were using food stamps in May 2025 than in May 2024, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Nationally, the number of people on food stamps decreased slightly, by about 11,000 people, according to the preliminary data.
The broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed in July will cut federal funding for SNAP and tighten eligibility requirements, but most of those changes won’t take effect until next year.










People’s resources are going to be strained in many ways in the years to come.


– Joseph Llobrera, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 


The largest increase in food stamp use was in North Dakota, where the number of recipients increased by 14% to about 57,000. In Texas the increase was 10%, followed by 7% in Kentucky and 5% in both Hawaii and Colorado.
New Mexico had the highest percentage of people receiving SNAP, about 21%. The lowest participation rates were in New Hampshire, Utah and Wyoming, all with about 5% of their populations on food stamps, according to the analysis.
The number of food stamp users fell by almost 17% in Alaska, which is struggling with a backlog of applications. The states with the next largest declines were Connecticut (8%), Wyoming (7%) Maine (6%) and Mississippi (5%).

The decrease in the national poverty rate, from 11% in 2023 to 10.6% last year, could be short-lived, said Joseph Llobrera, director of research for food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Llobrera predicted that looming federal cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, also part of Trump’s domestic policy law, will increase the number of people who can’t afford food and other basic needs. “People’s resources are going to be strained in many ways in the years to come,” Llobrera said.
Louisiana had the highest poverty rate in 2024 (18.7%) followed by Mississippi (17.8%) and the District of Columbia (17.3%). The lowest rates were in New Hampshire (7.2%), Utah (8.3%), Vermont (9%), Maryland (9.1%) and New Jersey (9.2%)

(Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector) Every spring, I venture to Gove County in western Kansas to witness one last connection to our wild shortgrass prairie heritage: the mating dance of the lesser prairie chicken. As the executive director for Audubon of Kansas, we host an annual prairie chicken festival that attracts people from all over the world to see this iconic prairie grouse species.
Last month, a court ruling removed Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie chicken. This decision will send the birds flying toward extinction. The last time that such protections for the lesser prairie chicken were removed in 2016, extensive habitat loss occurred, with the great majority of these changes being related to energy extraction — oil and natural gas infrastructure or wind turbines.
When I sit in the blind this coming spring, I will mourn the fact that those alive today might be the last generations able to witness this timeless tradition if these protections are not reinstated.
I venture out hours before sunrise to sit in a blind in the dark waiting for the birds to appear. In the murky, first light of dawn, shapes appear with a flurry of wings, cackling calls and gobbling songs. Prairie chicken males vigorously defend their territory, on this same patch of ground, year after year.
As I watch, I am surrounded by relict bison wallows, reminding me that these birds were always linked to grazing — formerly bison and now cattle. Because more than 90% of the birds’ habitat is on private land, many of those who raise grass-fed cattle are allies for prairie chickens.
This is the second time that lesser prairie chickens have had their protections vacated.
Besides being bad for the prairie chicken, this on-again, off-again approach is bad for landowners willing to participate in voluntary conservation measures. Imagine being a landowner counting on funding for removing woody vegetation to increase forage available for cattle grazing, only to have it disappear overnight. Imagine working toward enrolling your property in a conservation easement to ensure that your family’s ranching operation will be profitable long term and available to the next generation, only to have your business plan toppled.
Prairie chickens and ranching can coexist, but this regulatory uncertainty is bad for business — both ranching and energy.
The lesser prairie chicken, a colorful small grouse, needs unbroken tracts of prairie to survive and flourish. (Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)
When lesser prairie chickens were most recently listed, two distinct population segments were defined and given different protections: the northern population in Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and northern Texas was classified as “threatened,” whereas the southern population in New Mexico and western Texas was classified as “endangered.” A lawsuit was advanced in 2023 by the state of Texas and the Permian Basin Petroleum Association against the U.S. Department of Interior in federal court.
The plaintiffs argued that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service improperly applied its policy for determining distinct population segments. Distinct population segments must be both discrete (physically separated) and also significant (different in genetics, habitat, or other factors).
When lesser prairie chickens were listed in 2022, the ruling document explicitly explained that two distinct population segments were justified because they were separated by 95 miles (discrete), and the two populations showed significant differences in habitat (oak-shinnery vs sage and bluestem) and genetic structure, and that the loss of one of the population segments would result in at least a 25 percent decline in habitat occupied (significant threat to area occupied).
However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service willfully neglected its own previous scientific finding in federal court.
The court ruling documents: “Following the change in federal administration in January 2025, Fish and Wildlife re-evaluated Plaintiff’s claims and now believe it erred in applying the distinct population segment policy and did not provide a sufficient justification that the two population segments of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken are significant for the purpose of identifying a distinct population segment.”
In other words, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service argues that there is enough evidence that the two populations are discrete, but not enough evidence that they were significant, despite ample evidence to the contrary.
For 30 years, various conservation measures have been enacted to bring back lesser prairie chickens. Yet, the birds have continued to decline. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service anticipates that it will make a new finding on the 2016 listing petition by Nov. 30, 2026.
So this loss of protection will hopefully be short-lived—and this time the protection should stick.
Endangered Species Act protections are a last-ditch effort to prevent extinction, and they have been successfully applied to save the vast majority of the species listed. Lesser prairie chickens need the protection of the ESA, and landowners need support to enact conservation measures that are good for the herd and good for the bird.

According to the Ohio Department of Health, about 1 in 7 Ohio five-year-olds entered Kindergarten this year unvaccinated. This is up from about 1 in 10 in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
One in ten is not a great baseline. According to the World Health Organization, that number needs to be closer to 1 in 20 for “herd immunity” to stop measles from spreading. This is certainly part of the reason Ohio has seen 35 measles cases this year.
The speed vaccination rates are falling in Ohio puts children at risk for even more diseases, though. If Ohio creeps closer to 1 in 5 children unvaccinated, children will approach the point where they are no longer herd immune to polio.
What can we do about this? 
Certainly we are living in an age of misinformation where trust in institutions like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and even the Ohio Department of Health have declined. 
This has led to parents making decisions that the best medical science tells us is putting their children at risk for lifelong conditions or even death. 
Are there public policy solutions to this problem?

If policymakers are interested in improving vaccination rates and saving lives in the progress, they have options.
First, they can tighten nonmedical exemptions. 
A parent who leaves a gun unattended or a toddler next to a swimming pool in Ohio can be found negligent for endangering their child. 
A parent who refuses to put their child in a car seat or leaves their child in a hot car can be found negligent for endangering their child. 
But if a parent refuses to vaccinate their child, exposing them to life-threatening illnesses, they are protected by current Ohio law.
 Eliminating “reasons of conscience” that allow parents to opt out of vaccination requirements for whatever reason they see fit can help protect children and their peers. 
If policymakers are too squeamish to protect children in this way, they can instead help educate parents by requiring in-person vaccine education sessions, which has had some positive effect in helping parents make better decisions for their children in Michigan.
Second, the state can use its immunization information system to improve compliance with vaccination requirements. 
The state has a database that tracks immunizations across the state. The state can use this system to send auto-reminders like text messages, phone calls, or letters to families who are not up to date. 
The state can then publish schools that have low compliance rates by the Oct. 15 deadline so the public knows which schools are struggling to keep their children safe.
These are just two examples of what the state can do to increase immunization rates and protect children from lifechanging illnesses like measles and polio. 
Ohio has made so much progress in eradicating deadly diseases and immunization is a huge piece of the puzzle for how this has come to be. 
If policymakers can find ways to protect more children, they should do it.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)Nebraska and the federal Department of Homeland Security on Aug. 19 announced that the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted into a federal immigration detention facility, which Homeland Security branded the “Cornhusker Clink.”
About 186 people at the camp will be transferred to another facility within the state’s prison system, which has for years operated under an “overcrowding emergency.” Local leaders in McCook said they got only a half-hour briefing before the public rollout of the proposal. More than a dozen state lawmakers have since demanded a public hearing. More than 18,000 Nebraskans have signed a petition opposing the facility change.
The decision landed as the fall semester began. On the first day of class, I asked my law school students a simple question: What is prison for? Most answered rehabilitation, as if it were obvious. They imagined facilities with treatment programs, classes and job training designed so that the people inside return home better equipped than when they went in.
Nebraska’s own Department of Correctional Services has long called rehabilitation “at the heart” of public safety. The state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook was one of the few facilities built to reflect that goal. Its mission statement is clear: “Empowering people to do better.”
That makes the August announcement telling. Nebraska is turning a facility built for rehabilitation into a warehouse for federal detainees. Spaces once used for programming will be repurposed into detention units for up to 300 people — a number well over the building’s stated capacity — in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The state insists rehabilitation is central, yet when faced with a choice, leaders sidelined that goal in favor of a contract with Washington.
Supporters of the plan point to money and safety. Both arguments are shaky. Financially, typical immigration detention contracts pay a daily rate for each person in custody. Many also include so-called “bed quotas” that require ICE to pay for a set number of beds whether they are filled or not.
On paper, that may look like stability. In practice, it ties Nebraska’s budget to shifting and unstable federal enforcement priorities. When ICE changes direction or cancels a contract, communities are left with obligations and no revenue stream.
Other states have learned how risky that bargain can be. In Florida, a court halted further construction at the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, leaving the state’s taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars. Nebraska risks a similar mistake, trading rehabilitation for federal promises that can disappear overnight.
Even if the contract holds, communities carry the hidden costs of detention. Local health systems must respond to detainee needs. Ambulance crews make the runs and emergency rooms absorb the surges. In rural Nebraska, those systems are already stretched. More than half of the state’s rural hospitals operate at a loss. Community Hospital in McCook recently closed its clinic in nearby Curtis. Detention will not reverse that.
The safety rationale is equally weak. The people who will be held in McCook will not be serving criminal sentences. They will be immigration detainees facing civil proceedings, many with no convictions. Federal data show that most ICE detainees have no criminal record, and national research finds that immigrants are incarcerated for crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born Americans.
Adding detention beds in McCook will not reduce crime or improve public safety. What makes communities safer are the basics: staffed hospitals, strong schools and reliable infrastructure.
What this project offers is spectacle, not safety or stability. It is easier to announce a new detention hub with a catchy name than to confront the slow, difficult work of fixing overcrowded prisons, stabilizing rural hospitals and funding genuine reentry programs that actually keep communities safe.
This is not just Nebraska’s story. For decades, rural America was told prisons would bring prosperity. That promise rarely held. Now immigration detention is being sold as the replacement. The bargain is the same: dependence without security, spectacle without substance and the hollowing out of scarce rehabilitative capacity.
I do not tell my students that rehabilitation is the only purpose or function of prisons. But I do ask them to notice the gap between rhetoric and reality. Nebraska says rehabilitation matters. Yet when faced with a choice, the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds. That choice is not only about corrections policy. It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.
Back in my classroom, the lesson is clearer now. My students still say prisons are supposed to rehabilitate. Nebraska just taught them something else: that what counts is not second chances, but how many people can be locked up. If that is not the message we want the next generation of lawyers, policymakers and citizens to absorb, this is the moment to change course.

(Photo/Courtesy of William & Mary's Batten School & VIMS)Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature don’t think climate change is something we Floridians should be worrying about. But I guess nobody told the stone crabs.
Stone crabs — or rather, their tasty claws — have long been considered a South Florida seafood specialty. You see them served at places like the iconic Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami Beach. In fact, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says that Florida crabbers harvest 99% of all stone crab claws in the U.S. And the prices they charge ensure the crabbers are anything but crabby.
But now stone crabs are showing up as far north as Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.
Why? Because climate change has made conditions right for them to move.
“This is the first documented instance of stone crabs now being able to live inside of Chesapeake Bay,” marine biologist Romuald Lipcius told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel last week. “I believe, because of warming waters, that now, all of a sudden, stone crabs were able to survive, grow, and live for a long time inside of Chesapeake Bay.”
This is the latest sign of how our fossil fuel addiction is drastically altering our world. But our state and federal political “leaders” owe so much to their oil industry campaign contributors, they don’t want to hear about the consequences. 
Last year, the governor signed into law a bill that deleted the two C-words from most places where they occurred in state law. More recently, his “Department of Governmental Efficiency” has targeted local government programs focused on weaning people off fossil fuels in its search for “wasteful spending.”
Two years ago, our Ivy League-educated governor admitted that climate change is real. Yet now he seems far more concerned about the danger posed by rainbow crosswalks than the damage done by rapidly intensifying hurricanes or rising sea levels.
Meanwhile, the federal Department of Energy has released a report that insists any concern about our warming world is overblown. Eighty-five scientists condemned the report as “riddled with errors, misrepresentations and cherry-picked data to fit the president’s political agenda.”
While these people desperately attempt to silence the science, nature is repeatedly showing us that the truth can’t be ignored. It just keeps poking its head up and saying, “Yo! I’m still here! What are you going to do about it?”
Virginia is for crabs
If you’re not familiar with stone crabs, they got their name because, as the Fort Myers News Press once reported, “In the water, stone crabs look like stones, like muddy-gray river rocks indistinguishable from the rocks under which they burrow.”
Stone crabs’ powerful claws are so huge, they account for more than half of their total weight. They’re also specialized. One claw is for crushing, the other for tearing. To us humans, though, the meat from either one tastes delicious.
Stone crab via FWC
Crabbers carefully remove only one claw and toss the crab back so it can regrow the appendage. This is why stone crabs are considered a sustainable fishery. But it’s also a major reason why the claws cost so much — that, and the fact that the season for catching them lasts only from Oct. 15 to May 1.
In 1978, a Florida legislator tried to pass a law banning anyone from harvesting both claws. To show why this law was needed, he brought in a stone crab missing both claws and tossed it into a tank with a triggerfish.
The triggerfish, “over the gruesome course of an hour, attacked it, killed it and picked it clean,” the News Press noted. But the bill did not pass. Anglers know not to risk their livelihood by getting greedy and taking both claws.
Because I consider fresh seafood one of Florida’s greatest glories, I called up Lipcius to find out more about the Chesapeake stone crabs. Turns out, stone crab larvae have been repeatedly spotted in the Chesapeake for several years now. But they wouldn’t stick around long, he said.
“They can’t survive temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit,” he explained. “In Chesapeake Bay, the water temperature used to routinely drop below that in the winter.”
That’s not happening anymore, he said. The water has warmed too much. The crabbers are catching stone crabs that have survived three or four Virginia winters, he told me.
“I believe the stone crabs are here to stay,” he said. Scientists are now searching for signs that they’ve even begun breeding in the Chesapeake.
Because the crabbers finding them in their blue crab traps aren’t experienced at removing claws, he said, “for now we’re telling them, ‘Why don’t you toss them back?’” But soon, he predicted, local restaurants will start putting them on the menu.
Lipcius told me the stone crabs aren’t the only subtropical species to warm up to the warmer Chesapeake.
“We’ve never had a white shrimp fishery,” he said. “But now all of a sudden, they’re a common species here.”
He said one of the Chesapeake crabbers told him he’d caught three triggerfish. I guess it’s good that the stone crabs had both claws to fend off them off.
Virginia’s tourism slogan says that the state is for lovers. The way things are going, they may be able to add that it’s for lovers of Florida seafood.
Finding a unicorn
Lipcius called the Chesapeake stone crabs a rare instance of climate change creating a good-news story. I suppose it’s good news for folks in Virginia to have easier access to a type of seafood once considered exclusive to Florida.
But I wondered if it’s good news for Florida, where we’ve seen repeated marine heat waves that left us all in hot water.
Ryan Gandy via Sarasota Bay Estuary Program
To find out, I turned to Ryan Gandy, science and restoration manager for the Sarasota Bay Estuary Program. Before that, he spent 15 years as the FWC’s top stone crab expert.
Sure enough, Gandy told me the increased warmth of the waters off our coast has been causing problems for our own stone crabs and the crabbers catching them.
“They’re a biological indicator that the system is warming up,” Gandy said, referring to the trend.
The FWC has tried to protect stone crabs during the spawning season. But the spawning season has been changing because of the change in water temperature.
“We’re seeing [the spawning] begin earlier and earlier in the year,” Gandy said. “We used to close the season on May 15. Now it closes on May 1.”
Stone crabs are tough crustaceans, he said. A marine heat wave won’t kill them the way it does other species. But higher temperatures may hurt their prey.
“They feed on a lot of clams and mollusks like snails,” he said. Those species may be injured or killed by toxic algae blooms that have been known to accompany the heat waves, he told me.
Like Lipcius, Gandy also mentioned other species changing their habits and habitats because of climate change. The feisty snook, for instance.
“It used to be finding a snook in the Florida Panhandle was like finding a unicorn,” he said.  “Now it’s not unusual to find them near Pensacola.”
Snakes alive
There are plenty of other signs that nature’s being disrupted by the greenhouse gases spewing from our cars, trucks, boats, jets, and power plants.
As the world warms up, mangroves are sprouting in places they’ve never grown before. Our oceans have absorbed so much CO2, they’re becoming more acidic. Sea turtles, whose sex is determined by the temperature of the beach where they’re hatched, are turning out entire generations that are all female because it’s too hot to produce males.
Dave Zierden via FSU
I called up Dave Zierden, Florida’s official state climatologist — yes, we really do have one! — to ask him about this. He named several more examples. Invasive species, for instance.
Take those Burmese pythons we keep sending hunters out in the Everglades to track down. The snakes are slithering further and further north, showing up in West Palm Beach and Fort Myers. I keep waiting for one to claim a seat in the Florida Legislature, since that place tends to attract slimy characters.
Or look at what’s happening with green iguanas, which first wriggled their way into South Florida in 1965. Now the lizards that like to pop up in your toilet are showing up in Orange, Osceola, and Polk counties, too.
Both altered their range because of the changes we’ve made to the atmosphere, Zierden told me.
“More and more species of wildlife and plant life move further north as we get warmer temperatures,” he said.
Other pests are benefiting from our warmer weather, too — whiteflies, for instance, which attack Florida’s ornamental plant industry. Mosquitoes, which spread diseases such as dengue fever, are thriving thanks to the increased rain, longer summers, and milder winters.

Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright called concerns about climate change “silly.” Wright, the former CEO of a natural gas fracking company, is busy this week plugging gas and oil in Europe as if that’s who still employs him, not us taxpayers.
“Climate change, for impacting the quality of your life, is not incredibly important,” Wright said last week, according to The New York Times. “In fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know.”
I guess nobody told him about our rapidly intensifying hurricanes.
They don’t care
Just this week, DeSantis’ newly appointed lieutenant governor, Jay Collins, was bragging about what a great job he and his boss were doing.
Jay Collins via his FB page
“Aren’t you glad to live in a state that values its people, that fights for the things that matter, and prioritizes the things that make a difference at your kitchen table, at your dinner table and for your family?” he said, according to Politico.
But they’re NOT doing that.
In fact, Collins was the Senate sponsor of the bill deleting most mentions of climate change from state law, a bill that DeSantis signed.
Every time DeSantis, Collins, and the rest turn their heads away from the dangers posed by climate change, they’re showing that they do not value Floridians and their lives at all.
They aren’t doing anything about our rising sea levels or the changes in our weather patterns, other than pretending it doesn’t exist. The insurance companies know that this is what’s driving our multiple disasters, but you won’t hear a peep about it out of our “leaders.”
They’ll eagerly tackle kooky stuff like “chemtrails” and “ending vaccine mandates.” But they’re hostile to anything backed up by actual science. Sometimes I think we should refer to the governor as “Denial-Santis.” He’d rather scoff than do anything constructive.
I have been pondering how we could turn the steering wheel on this demolition derby car away from the crash we can see coming. The solution may lie with the stone crabs.
I think we need to flood the governor’s mailbox with letters, emails, and phone calls complaining about how Virginia is stealing our native seafood. Why, those Virginians are just a bunch of crab-nappers! We need to claw back those delicious claws!
This will engage our governor’s overly developed sense of grievance. I’m sure he’ll immediately declare a state of emergency and order the stone crabs returned.
To get the crabs to stick around, we need to convince him to make sure they’re comfortable here — no more marine heat waves, plenty of prey, and so forth.
Unless someone else volunteers, I can be the one to tell him this. But I want a guarantee that I can get stone crab claws for free for the rest of my life. If you have to deal with a crabby politician, you should get rewarded with the claws.

The baby’s muscles were totally rigid so that it was impossible for him to lie flat. His jaw was clamped shut and when he attempted to cry, an eerie humming emanated from his clenched lips. It was an obvious case of tetanus.
I placed an intravenous line in the child to hydrate him and a nasogastric tube in his stomach to feed him. I gave him antibiotics, but the tetanus immunoglobulin was not available. The baby died.

Joseph Bentivegna MD
Horrors like this were not uncommon in Haiti where there was little vaccination. I saw many patients maimed by polio. Children frequently died from measles.
Any reader interested in what happens when there is a lack of vaccines can read Chapter 9 from my book, The Neglected and Abused: A Physician’s Year in Haiti, by clicking this link. There is no charge.
No one in their right mind wants to see these tragedies reoccur in the United States. But it could happen as many supposed experts in public health have lost their credibility with many citizens. This culminated with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., firing numerous public health officials.
A major incident causing public distrust occurred in 1980 when the prestigious medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, published a study that stated opioids were not addictive. This was pure idiocy. A drug company, Purdue Pharma, used this study to goad public health bureaucrats to ease up on the safeguards governing the prescription of these drugs. They then launched an army of opioid salespeople to seduce a class of greedy doctors to push these drugs on patients. The result, hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of addicts.
Ethically compromised judges looked the other way and allowed the owners of Purdue Pharma to keep much of their ill-gotten gains. This is chronicled in the book, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty and the Netflix movie, Painkiller, for any reader who desires more information.
But the real damage was done by government policy during the COVID epidemic. While data showed that the vaccines were lifesaving in certain groups such as the elderly, the diabetic, the immunocompromised and the obese, the data supporting the COVID vaccine for children was dubious at best. But the vaccine was pushed on everybody. 
Plus, the fact that the CEO of Moderna, the manufacturer of the mRNA COVID vaccine, earned hundreds of millions during the pandemic heightened skepticism that this was just another corporate money grabbing scam.
Meanwhile a host of hurried and inconsistent rulings during the COVID epidemic allowed for contradictory and controversial outcomes, like closing some churches while allowing strip clubs to remain open.
In short, mixed messages from the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Anthony Fauci and others — all widely distributed and the subject of politically charged debate in both social media and mainstream outlets — resulted in mistrust and confusion in the minds of many as to the utility of all vaccines.
But the implications of this are devastating. Now many people who voted for Donald Trump believe that all vaccines are a scam. Florida’s Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has stated that vaccines in Florida should be voluntary. (Obviously, Ladapo has never been to Haiti.) Technically, this policy does not apply to measles, polio and tetanus vaccines, but it is unlikely that the average voter knows or understands this.


A reasonable compromise would be to review the latter recommendations for childhood vaccination. 
But public officials like Kennedy and Ladopa must take care in their actions and words. Vaccines have saved millions upon millions of lives and publicly challenging their efficacy could result in disastrous cases, such as the poor baby I tried to save in Haiti.

Today, most comedians deliberately weave the rude and crude negativity of sarcasm, cynicism, insults, criticism, swearing and sexual innuendo into the fabric of their skits. Yet not all comedy must include these things.

Gerry Williams
There is a growing movement across the United States and in Connecticut that’s broadly defined as “clean comedy.” It’s full of levity without being lewd. For example, I recently participated in the Uncompromised Comedy Conference in Atlanta. Comedians gathered for three days to inspire, encourage and equip each other to enlarge the professional presence of clean comedy in the performing arts of today and the future.
Here in Connecticut, my peers and I such as Rev. Dr. T.C. Brantley, Pastor of Restoration Springs Church in Waterbury; Savanda LaTrece, and others perform clean comedy. We perform at churches, banquets, festivals, fairs, parties, showers and such well-established organizations as the Central Connecticut Cooperative Farmers Association, Comix Roadhouse at Mohegan Sun, Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, Foxwoods Resort, Funny Bone Comedy Club, Knights of Columbus and Playhouse on Park in West Hartford. 
Some of the pioneering churches include Black Rock Church in Fairfield, Calvary Church in Southbury, Trinity United Methodist Church in Windsor and Victory Church in Middlebury. With over 3,000 faith-based organizations in Connecticut alone, think of the potential for clean comedy to permeate our state in a very grassroots way. How refreshing!
Based on our experience, crowd response is consistently positive. In some instances, parents even bring their teenage children for a fun night out! For venue owners, ticket and concession revenues are making clean comedy financially feasible.
For the pendulum to continue to swing away from lewd and toward levity, comedy show ticket-buyers, advertisers and sponsors must intentionally request that clean comedy acts be booked at their favorite local and area venues. I encourage you to make “clean” social media posts supportive of clean comedians. Email, text or mail “clean” messages to booking agents and venue managers. 
Perhaps the single best way to reach out is to simply pick up the phone and call these contacts person-to-person. Even a polite and passionate voicemail can encourage more clean comedy in your community. By all means, if you are active in an organization that creates events, suggest clean comedy for the entertainment. It’s funny how just a few advocates of clean comedy can make such a positive difference.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Maryland political leaders from both sides of the aisle were united Wednesday in their call for an end to political violence, after the fatal shooting of high-profile conservative political activist Charlie Kirk during an event at a Utah college campus.
“Today, Maryland, the country, and the world saw yet another act of heinous political violence on American soil,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a written statement Wednesday evening.
“Political violence is unacceptable. We will not tolerate it – not now, not ever,” his statement said. “In the wake of today’s events, we share a collective responsibility to condemn this tragedy in the strongest possible terms and be bold in our commitment to greater unity and peace.”
Moore ordered that flags on state facilities will be flown at half-staff, through sundown Sunday, mirroring an earlier order by President Donald Trump (R) who said U.S. flags would be flown at half-staff “as a mark of respect for the memory of Charlie Kirk.”
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

The shooting brought an outpouring of statements from Maryland political leaders throughout the afternoon Wednesday, echoing Moore’s remark, after news broke of the attack.
Maryland’s Senate Republicans joined in a written statement, praising Kirk and calling for a rejection of political violence.
“The killing of Charlie Kirk is a shocking and tragic act of violence. He was a husband, a father and a national voice who chose to engage in spirited debate and conversation on collage campuses,” the statement said. “There is never any justification for political violence.”
Kirk was appearing Wednesday afternoon at an event at Utah Valley University sponsored by Turning Point USA, the youth-oriented political organization he founded and ran. At similar campus events, he would take questions from students and debate the on various political topics.
Kirk was in the middle of responding to a question on gang violence and mass shootings around 12:20 p.m. when he appeared to be struck by a single shot, according to reports. Videos of the attack and students fleeing the campus quickly circulated online.
Kirk was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival, according to news reports. Trump announced the death on Truth Social at 4:40 p.m.
It’s yet another high-profile shooting of a political figure in a little more than a year dating back to  July 2024, when Trump narrowly avoided an assassination attempt while on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania.
In June of this year, Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Melissa Hortman (D) and her husband were shot and killed at their home in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) called a “politically motivated attack.” Just hours earlier, Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman (D) and his wife were shot in their home, but survived. The same man is suspected in both shootings.
Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said in a social media post Wednesday that, just as he “tragically” prayed for the Hortman family after the Minnesota shooting, “I now pray for the Kirk family who is facing the unimaginable.”
What Melissa Hortman means to Maryland

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) lamented a school shooting in Colorado that also occurred midday Wednesday as the news primarily followed Kirk’s attack.
“First the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and then the shooting at Evergreen High School,” Scott said on social media. “This senseless violence has no place in our country, whether politically motivated or otherwise. No one should ever have to live in fear in our classrooms, schools or places of worship.”
Maryland’s lone Republican in Congress, U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), called Kirk an “American patriot” and wished his family well during “this time of imaginable loss.”
Sympathy for Kirk and his family, as well as bipartisan condemnation of political violence, began as soon as news of his shooting was out, even before Kirk’s death was confirmed.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) and House Minority Whip Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick) said in a joint statement that “we cannot hate our way to a better America.”
“We cannot commit horrific acts of wanton violence against those who may strongly disagree with us about matters of public policy,” their statement said. “That is not democracy. It is not American. We must make sure that every citizen of this nation, of all political persuasions, understands that violence in pursuit of silencing debate is never the answer and that no one should countenance these disgusting actions.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (MD-D) agreed, posting that “violence is never the answer” when he learned Kirk was shot. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called the attack “horrific and senseless.”
“There can be absolutely no place for political violence in America,” Hogan said in a social media post.
Maryland U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) took to social media to condemn “another absolutely disgraceful act of gun violence” and offered thoughts and prayers for Kirk’s family prior to his death.
“We must categorically reject all violence in our society,” Raskin’s statement said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_Kirk-Shooting_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 23:56:17.044270

Nine organizations across Delaware will receive a combined $173,000 through the Tree for Every Delawarean Initiative (TEDI), supporting the planting of 12,055 trees in the spring of 2026.
TEDI is a statewide effort led by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and the Department of Agriculture’s Delaware Forest Service, intending to plant one million trees by 2030.
 Since the initiative began, more than 350,000 trees have already been planted with the help of partners and a range of funding sources.
RELATED STORY: ASMFC to hold public hearing on proposed striped bass management plan
“TEDI has a goal of a million trees for Delaware’s million residents because of everything they do for us,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “From an environmental perspective, trees pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which means they combat climate change. Trees in urban areas provide shade, reducing the heat island effect and lowering energy costs.”
Funding Recipients
The following groups will receive support for tree planting projects:

Delaware Nature Society (Hockessin)

Mount Cuba Center (Hockessin)

Delaware Wild Lands, Inc. (Odessa)

Delaware Center for the Inland Bays (Rehoboth Beach)

Skyline Middle School (Red Clay Consolidated School District)

West Park Place Elementary School (Christina School District)

Friends of Bellevue State Park (Wilmington)

University of Delaware (Newark)

Village of Ardentown (New Castle County)


Robert “Blake” Moore of the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension said the funding will help move forward the Kranz Farm food forest tree project.
“That project will support a variety of wildlife, as well as provide water quality and climate carbon sequestration and storage benefits,” he said.
Fall Tree Giveaways
In addition to funding the planting projects, TEDI will host nine tree giveaway events this fall, distributing 2,250 trees directly to residents across all three counties. Event dates and locations are listed at de.gov/tedi and DNREC’s Calendar of Events, and include:

Sept. 20: University of Delaware Cooperative Extension (Milford)

Sept. 26: New Castle County (Glasgow Regional Park)

DOVER – The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) will host a hybrid public hearing on Thursday, Sept. 18, from 6 to 8 p.m., to gather public input on Draft Addendum III to Amendment 7 of the Atlantic Striped Bass Interstate Fishery Management Plan.
The hearing will take place in person at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control’s Little Creek Hunter Education Center Training Center, or participants can attend virtually.
The proposed action is designed to increase the likelihood of rebuilding striped bass stock to target levels by 2029. To reach that goal, the plan calls for reducing fishery removals by 12% beginning in 2026.
RELATED STORY: Dam removal project restores natural flow for fish in Brandywine River
For the commercial sector, the draft addendum proposes a quota reduction. For the recreational fishery, options under consideration include season closures and changes to size limits. In Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay recreational fishery, the plan proposes adjusting the baseline season to simplify regulations, improve compliance and enforcement, and better align fishing access with mortality rates of released striped bass.
Current rules allow states to decide whether to tag commercially harvested striped bass at the point of harvest or at the point of sale. The draft addendum raises concerns that tagging at the point of sale could increase the risk of illegal harvest. To address this, the plan considers requiring tagging either at the point of harvest or at the first point of landing to strengthen enforcement and compliance.

The addendum also highlights concerns over inconsistent methods used to measure the total length of striped bass for compliance with size limits.

Mike Shower will run for lieutenant governor alongside Republican gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson, the two announced Tuesday night in Big Lake.
Wilson is the first of Alaska’s 10 governor candidates to announce her running mate.
The other nine candidates include former Democratic Sen. Tom Begich of Anchorage and eight Republicans: former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; and Bruce Walden of Palmer. Former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is also expected to file for the office.
Current Rep. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, said he will run for Shower’s seat in the state Senate. Rauscher previously ran for Senate in 2018 and said he put his name in “one minute after Bernadette stated it was Shower.”
By phone, Wilson said the lieutenant governor has two jobs: taking care of the state seal, and taking care of elections. 
“The Division of Elections is incredibly important and too important to get passed off to who is the politically expedient candidate,” she said.

Bernadette Wilson and Mike Shower pose for a photo on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025, in Big Lake, Alaska. (Bernadette Wilson photo)

Wilson said she believes “election integrity and the ability to vote at the ballot box is the very foundation of the Republic” and said that Shower is the right person to fix problems with voting in rural Alaska, an unusually large voter roll, and slow-to-arrive results.
“I felt very confident that Sen. Mike Shower has the knowledge in that area. It is an area that he is passionate about, which is the first step in solving any problem, and he’s worked on that extensively. So I felt that that was incredibly important and made him the best choice for Alaska’s next lieutenant governor,” she said.
Shower served over 20 years as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and currently works as a commercial cargo pilot. 
Shower was originally appointed to the Senate in February 2018 to replace Mike Dunleavy, who held the seat until resigning to run for governor. Elected on his own merits later that year and re-elected in 2022, he has repeatedly introduced proposals to make changes to the state’s elections system.
His first proposal was introduced in 2019 related to election security protocols, before President Donald Trump began lying about fraud in the 2020 election. 
Currently the Senate’s minority leader, he has regularly re-introduced legislation related to the state’s elections system and has frequently been a key figure in end-of-session negotiations on the topic. Thus far, the Legislature has been unable to pass significant changes.
As a member of the Senate, Shower has consistently endorsed the idea of a large Permanent Fund dividend, going so far as to propose a statewide tax in order to pay for it. 
Wilson said that she and Shower are confident in their ability to win the governor’s race, but if they finish behind another Republican in the August primary, they will withdraw and throw their support behind the leading Republican.
Under Alaska’s current voting system, all candidates for the same office run in the same race, regardless of political party. The top four-vote getters advance to the general election, where Alaskans use ranked choice voting to pick the ultimate winner.
Wilson, one of the leaders of a campaign to repeal that system, said she believes “that when you’ve got multiple people on the ballot of any party, it leads to so much confusion, it leads to voters only ranking one at the end of the day. … I think it’s very arrogant to say, Well, I’m not the top vote getter, but I’m going to stay in anyways. I just don’t think that that’s appropriate.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Japan’s largest electric company has agreed to buy 1 million tons of natural gas per year from the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, developer Glenfarne announced Wednesday.
A final decision on whether to build the pipeline for in-state use is expected by the end of the year. 
Company officials say that by the end of 2026, they will decide whether to build the pipeline’s export components, which would be needed to fulfill the new deal.
Under a deal finalized in March, Glenfarne owns 75% of the AKLNG project, as the gas effort is known, with the remaining 25% owned by the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a state-owned corporation.
Financing the multibillion-dollar project is a major hurdle, and export agreements like the one signed Wednesday with the Japanese utility JERA, which produces one-third of Japan’s electricity, could decide whether banks are willing to loan money for the pipeline’s construction.
Glenfarne has previously announced agreements with Taiwan’s CPC and Thailand’s PTT, both state-owned energy companies. 
When all three agreements are combined, they amount to 9 million tons of the expected 20 million-ton pipeline capacity. Glenfarne itself may take another share, approximately 2 million tons per year, though that share could be replaced by other third-party agreements.
As a result, Glenfarne now has “preliminary commercial agreements for more than half of Alaska LNG’s available third-party LNG offtake capacity,” it said in a statement.
Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for the project. Rex Cannon, co-president of the subsidiary 8 Star Alaska, in charge of developing the pipeline project, said last month that the U.S. Department of Energy could provide federal loans for the effort.
A recently negotiated trade deal between Japan and the United States could have the government of Japan invest in the project as well, but that idea remains unconfirmed.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed in a TV interview last week that Japan would be required under the broader trade deal to direct $550 billion toward projects in the United States. He suggested the Alaska gas pipeline as an example.
Japanese officials have not confirmed Lutnick’s perspective, and reports out of Japan have been skeptical.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, resigned on Sunday, and it was not immediately clear whether that would affect trade negotiations.
This week, the news service Reuters reported that Japan has hired energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie to assess the feasibility of the pipeline project. Wood Mackenzie worked for the state on previous iterations of the project.
South Korea, another major potential buyer of Alaska gas, has not yet announced whether it will or will not buy gas from the pipeline or otherwise participate.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250828-Rex-Cannon-slide-1024x853.jpg,,,2025-09-10 21:57:26.074460

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) HARWOOD, N.D. — The Harwood City Council gave final approval for a data center Wednesday but the city of Fargo plans to continue to pursue adding the site to its city limits. 
Harwood called a special meeting Wednesday to approve rezoning 320 acres from agricultural to light industrial so Texas-based Applied Digital can build a $3 billion facility where tech companies can house computers for creating artificial intelligence. 
Harwood’s City Hall was filled to capacity for the meeting, with some project opponents pressing signs against the windows for council members to see. Many of the signs urged the council and Mayor Blake Hankey to allow public comment.

Hankey, who led the meeting remotely, asked council members if they wanted to take public comments but none did. 
The Applied Digital building site is southeast of Harwood, outside the city limits, at the edge of its extraterritorial area. The property is adjacent to Fargo’s extraterritorial area. 
Jim Gilmour, director of strategic planning and research for the city of Fargo, said in an interview before the meeting that Fargo is better suited to develop the infrastructure, such as roads and sewer lines, that the project will need. 
“We’re in a better position as a city of 135,000 to kind of work with that growth versus a city of a few hundred,” Gilmour said. 
Gilmour said Fargo will be mailing annexation notices to property owners, the city of Harwood, Cass County and townships of its proposal to annex three areas between Fargo and Harwood, including the Applied Digital site. 
He said the Fargo City Commission will meet Nov. 10 to review any protests and make a decision on whether to push forward. 
If Fargo does try for annexation, Gilmour said it may be up to an administrative law judge to decide if the area belongs to Harwood or Fargo. 
On the line is tax dollars each year that Applied Digital would pay that could support local services. 
Harwood contends it would have to give Fargo permission to annex the property. At a Sept. 2 meeting, the Harwood City Council voted against giving Fargo that permission. 
At the meeting, Applied Digital Executive Vice President Nick Phillips said the company would side with Harwood if jurisdiction were to come down to a legal battle. 
Gilmour said the extraterritorial areas were established in a 1998 agreement between Harwood and Fargo, but that agreement expired after 10 years. 
“So there really is no agreement between the two cities right now for who should have what territory,” Gilmour said. 
Wednesday’s special meeting of the Harwood City Council was called to give a second and final reading to approving the zoning change and building permit that Applied Digital needs to break ground. 
Company announces plan for $3 billion data center north of Fargo

The initial votes came Sept. 2 after contentious public hearings. Applied Digital has tried to assure area residents that the data center won’t drive up utility rates or use large amounts of water. 
The company may break ground yet this month. Keith Leier, senior construction manager for Applied Digital, said the company wanted to work out some traffic flow details before moving dirt at the site. 
The first part of the facility that it calls Polaris Forge 2 is planned to be operational in the second half of 2026 and phase two operational in 2027.
Applied Digital said the data center will have 200 to 300 employees in addition to numerous contractors. 
The company also has sites in Jamestown and Ellendale. 
Dale Rosenkranz, a 20-year Harwood resident, was among those who called for the council to take public comments. 
He said the four-member council was “hiding behind their authority.”  He said the approval process felt rushed since Applied Digital made its plans public on Aug. 18. 
Rosenkranz said Harwood, a town of about 800 people,  would lose the “small, comfortable” feel that attracted many residents. 
“The town is going to change,” he said.

(Photo courtesy Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)In recent days, residents of Virginia and other states began to need a prescription from their primary care provider in order to get a COVID vaccine, a change prompted by shifting federal requirements. An order the Virginia Department of Health issued Wednesday now makes it easier for eligible Virginians to get vaccines in the weeks ahead.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently ended broad emergency authorizations for COVID vaccines that have been in place since vaccines first rolled out for the global pandemic. Under that new federal rule, health care providers and pharmacists could no longer freely offer COVID shots to the public. The new standing order allows Virginians 18 and older to still receive vaccines, sans prescription.
The new federal requirements to be 64 and older or have a prescription had posed challenges for people statewide, according to health care workers and advocates.
 “While one barrier might not seem like a big deal for one population, it is for others,” University of Virginia nursing professor Ashley Apple recently told The Mercury. 
Those who live in rural areas or areas with fewer hospitals or primary care clinics may have a harder time accessing a primary care provider and obtaining a prescription. That’s about 3.8 million Virginians statewide, according to a recent Virginia Commonwealth University study. 
Last week, two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic closed that serve patients in the Shenandoah Valley. Augusta Health, which had operated those clinics, cited federal actions like forthcoming health care changes in the reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer as a contributing factor. But the closures still mean less of their health care footprint in the region, and hurdles for some of their patients. 
Before VDH’s order, Apple had anticipated a “bottleneck” at primary care clinics, as both current patients and new ones seeking to establish a primary care provider would rush to schedule appointments for prescriptions. She had also suggested the health department issue such an order to quickly open access to the vaccine. The Mercury had asked VDH Tuesday if this type of order was a possibility; VDH epidemiology spokesman Logan Anderson said he wasn’t yet able to answer the question. 
While the order can alleviate some of the current hiccup amid the shifting federal policies, accessibility to COVID-19 shots are still up in the air pending other federal actions. 
On Sep. 18, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet to discuss guidance for doctors, insurance companies and states on how shots can be accessed. 
Insurance companies typically cover vaccines that are recommended by the CDC, but that could change depending on what the ACIP meeting entails. 
For people with insurance, their shots might be covered or partially-covered. Out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus vaccines can range in hundreds of dollars. CVS, for instance, charges $224.99. 
While ACIP plans to deliberate the future landscape of vaccines, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed critics of coronavirus vaccines to the committee, which could signal that the shots may be less accessible, more broadly. 
In the meantime, VDH’s order can help those wishing to get their vaccines in the near future. The nation is no longer experiencing a global pandemic, and vaccines have played a role in reducing infections. Last week, nearly 4,000 Virginians tested positive for COVID-19. As colder months approach and people are more likely to gather inside, airborne spread illnesses typically experience upticks.

September is the final month of the federal budget year, and typically, the training held at armories across Washington on the second weekend draws a large turnout. 
But due to a budget shortfall, adjustments were made to pare participation and reduce costs.
Approximately 5,000 soldiers were scheduled to drill for the full weekend. An estimated half received an excused absence while the other half participated for a portion but not the entire period, officials said. Those with training requirements drilled and any soldier who desired to participate could, officials said. 
“The work that needed to be accomplished, got accomplished,” said Joseph Siemandel, state public affairs officer for the Washington National Guard.
Exactly how many did not take part and how much money was saved will be known in a few weeks. A typical drill weekend costs about $2.5 million, officials said. Participants earn between a couple hundred dollars to as much as $1,000 a weekend, based on their rank and number of service years.
There are a variety of reasons for the budget shortfall, said Karina Shagren, communications director for the Washington Military Department. 
One of those was the decision by the National Guard bureau to pull back funding for training from several states, including $3 million from Washington since February, “with the expectation that Congress would allocate funding to fill the hole left behind,” she said. 
“That expected funding has yet to arrive — and the money taken has been redirected to support other missions — to include domestic deployments,” she said.
Shagren did not know if funds shifted away from Washington went to underwrite costs associated with the deployment in the District of Columbia, or elsewhere such as the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.
Last month, President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the nation’s capital. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth followed that with a directive that they be allowed to carry weapons.
Trump has since signed an executive order directing state National Guard units to be ready to assist local, state and federal law enforcement. He’s threatened to use them in Chicago. More recently, he vowed to “clean up” Portland and “wipe out” protesters in Oregon’s largest city, propelling state officials into action to prevent such a move.
Trump has yet to set his sights on Seattle. 
Shagren said losing the dollars and excusing those soldiers from the most recent training has not weakened the capabilities of the state’s National Guard.
“On drill weekends, we focus on getting our men and women ready for all kinds of missions. So when those training opportunities get cut back, it clearly affects our overall readiness. That said, we’re still fully capable of responding to emergencies both here at home or abroad,” Shagren said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguardthree_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 20:56:43.985866

After wildlife advocates and retired biologists came out in force, the commission unanimously rejected an agency recommendation to remove Red Desert and Farson region from protected corridor.
The post Game and Fish Commission reverses plan to trim Wyoming’s first pronghorn migration corridor appeared first on WyoFile .","After a four-hour discussion about nixing protections for two portions of a famous pronghorn migration that weaves across the Green River Basin, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission reversed course to formally designate the route in its entirety. 
“With 20 years of science, data and the vast support of the public, I believe this should move forward to the next stage,” Commissioner Ken Roberts, who made the motion, said at Wednesday’s meeting in Lander. 
In the moment, the court clerk from Kemmerer didn’t say much about why he wasn’t going with Game and Fish’s recommendation to not designate two of the 10 segments of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration. That had come much earlier. Roberts jumped in to share his doubts shortly after the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s Jill Randall and Martin Hicks presented their agency’s proposal.
“I can’t see where it hurts anybody,” Roberts said of leaving the migration intact. “I’m just kind of mystified.”

Hicks, the state’s deputy chief of wildlife, reasoned the threats to pronghorn moving through the Red Desert and “East of Farson” segments didn’t rise to a level that warranted protection under Wyoming’s policy, which is being taken for its first spin nearly six years after it was revamped in response to industry concerns. 
“There’s no bottlenecks, and the threat levels were limited — that, to us, precluded designation,” Hicks said. 
He also explained there was a lack of “high-use” habitat in the two segments. That’s the designation for areas used by greater than 20% of collared pronghorn. 
But there was another unspoken factor at play that partly explained why Roberts was skeptical and why most seats were filled for hours at the Lander Community and Convention Center.
The Wyoming Stock Growers Association’s lobbyist, Jim Magagna, renowned for his influence in Wyoming politics, has a ranch in the vicinity, and he’d asked that the two segments be removed, while also noting that maintaining his land and grazing lease locations had nothing to do with the request.

On Wednesday, Maganga told commissioners his concern with including the two segments had to do with the sheer size of the migration corridor — at 2.6 million acres, it’s larger than Yellowstone National Park. 
“That’s going to build opposition to the whole concept of the executive order,” Magagna said. “It’s the lumping of everything together, that is our major concern.” 
There were other concerns aired as well. Oil and gas industry representatives shared doubts about the need to advance a new layer of habitat protection for a migration path that cuts across the Pinedale Anticline, Jonah and Normally Pressured Lance gas fields. Steve Degenfelder, a Casper-based landman for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, told the governor-appointed commission that the Anticline alone had generated $2.75 billion in education funding.

“Twelve-thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five Wyoming students had their entire K-12 education made by one project,” he said. 
Repeatedly through the morning, commissioner John Masterson asked commenters for input on how the Game and Fish Commission should balance its mission — “conserving wildlife and serving people” — with “perfectly legitimate” social and political considerations. The question was posed to Degenfelder, too.
“Your initiative should be towards wildlife,” Degenfelder said. 
The sentiment was a theme of almost all the other public comments. Retired biologists, recreational hunters and bunches of professional conservationists had a unified message in urging the seven-person commission to designate all 10 segments of the Sublette Pronghorn Migration. It’s among the largest and the best studied pronghorn populations in the world, and Brock Wahl of the North American Pronghorn Foundation worried about the repercussions of inaction or getting the designation wrong.
“If we can’t get it right in this particular instance,” he told commissioners, “I feel as if it sets a very bad precedent for anything going forward.”

Meghan Riley of the Wyoming Outdoor Council emphasized the sheer number of pronghorn migrating through the segments at risk of being axed. There are about 5,000, she said, far more than traverse the famous Path of the Pronghorn and punch through all the way to Jackson Hole. 
“It would be a mistake to discount the significance of this segment to the population as a whole,” Riley said. “Accessing summer range matters to animals’ survival just the same, whether that animal travels 165 miles or 30 miles.” 
Todd Guenther, a Lander archaeologist, joined the chorus in calling for the commission to designate the entire migration. Pronghorn are “fragile,” he said, and in need of “proactive” care. 
“Too many times over my life, since I was a kid, wildlife [has] become a sacrificial lamb for different types of development projects,” Guenther said. “We’re running out of opportunities to preserve these different forms of wildlife.”

Because of housing sprawl and industrial development, Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migrations are at “high risk” of being lost, according to an earlier Game and Fish analysis. In a later phase of the years-long process, the public came out in strong support of taking action and deploying Wyoming’s migration policy for the first time. Nearly 99% of the 530 comments the state agency received asked for designation, according to data Randall, with Game and Fish, presented in the meeting. 
Game and Fish Commissioner Rusty Bell, of Gilllette, cited the volume of public support as he explained why he was supporting Roberts’ motion to designate all 10 migratory segments used by the Sublette Pronghorn Herd. 
“I think people want to see designation,” Bell said. “I’m going to go along with what the people have said.” 
Unanimously, the other six commissioners made the same call. The Game and Fish Commission’s decision to buck its department’s proposal was “not unexpected,” Magagna told WyoFile after the vote. 
“I respect their decision,” he said. “We’ll go along to the next step and be engaged there.”
Next up in Wyoming’s labyrinthine designation process, Game and Fish’s migration proposal will go to Gov. Mark Gordon. If the governor finds it favorable, he’ll then appoint an “area working group” to review the migration. That will include representatives for each county that the corridor cuts through and a number of stakeholders — at least two will represent agriculture.

Judy Ward","A pharmacy manager retrieves a bottle of antibiotics. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of state senators heard from pharmacy owners about the impacts of pharmacy benefit manager reforms and what can still be done to stop pharmacies across the commonwealth from closing.
”It’s very telling to me that we have a caucus here of folks from rural and urban areas, Republican and Democrat, and we’re coming to you in desperation,” said Sen. Judy Ward (R-Blair), Republican chair of the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus.
One of the pharmacists sharing her experiences was Chichi Momah, the CEO and founder of Springfield Pharmacy in Delaware County.
Aside from filling prescriptions and administering vaccines, Momah’s business does tests for diseases like RSV and strep, provides special packaging for patients with memory issues, makes house calls to disabled patients, and regularly advises patients on a host of health issues — services that are especially important since the closure of nearby Crozer Medical Center and Taylor Hospital.
“Our work is hands-on. It’s constant and it is deeply personal,” Momah said.
Yet Momah said her pharmacy is struggling, and she’s often shifting funds around to keep all the pieces of her business afloat.
“We are exhausted,” she said. “We’re stretched thin and doing everything possible to serve patients with the very little resources we have.”
And the experience is not entirely unique.
According to the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus’ Democratic chair, Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton), around 600 pharmacies in Pennsylvania — often on the front lines of community health care — have closed in the last two years. Pharmacy owners and trade groups lay the blame largely on pharmaceutical industry middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
Pa. pharmacists demand state action to regulate PBMs, curb pharmacy closures

PBMs are companies hired by insurance providers to handle the prescription side of health insurance plans. When an insured patient picks up a script, paying only a co-pay if anything, it’s the PBM that reimburses the pharmacist on behalf of their insurance plan.
But the companies have come under scrutiny from both state lawmakers and federal regulators. Critics say they’ve contributed to the rising cost of drugs and driven down pharmacy’s bottom lines, leading to a wave of closures around the country.
One of the primary issues raised by pharmacists is the slowly dwindling reimbursement rates they receive for drugs they dispensed to covered patients. In some cases, what they receive from PBMs fails to cover the cost of stocking and dispensing the prescription.
The three largest PBMs in the country, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx, are estimated to represent roughly 80% of all health care plans. Pharmacists say that leaves them stuck with the option of accepting the reimbursement rates they offer or potentially losing all customers covered by them.

Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing many of the nation’s largest PBMs, said, “PBMs recognize that pharmacies are critical to providing patients access to get their prescriptions. That’s why PBMs are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase payments for dispensing drugs.”
Last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a law to rein in PBMs and give state regulators tools to block certain practices community pharmacists said were driving them out of business. But on Wednesday, pharmacists said the measures weren’t enough to stop their stores from closing.
“Act 77 is limited in scope,” said Victoria Elliott, CEO of the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association, a trade group representing independent and small chain pharmacies across the state. “If that were expanded, we might not be having this conversation.” 
While the law banned certain practices criticized as anti-competitive — such as PBMs funneling patients toward preferred pharmacies that are often owned by the same parent company — it did not require the middlemen to reimburse pharmacies at higher rates.
According to state Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys, while he expects the law to help struggling pharmacies, he said it only applies to PBMs contracted for commercial healthcare plans written in Pennsylvania. That’s roughly a quarter of plans in the commonwealth.
And some parts of the law have yet to kick in.
“We realized the delayed effect dates for Act 77 have caused confusion and frustration as Pennsylvania community pharmacies are struggling and in need of assistance,” Humphreys said.

But the hearing focused primarily on the role of prescriptions filled through Medicaid, a health insurance program run by the state, which accounts for around 11% of all prescriptions in the commonwealth.
Federal law makes it difficult to regulate many commercial health insurance plans on the state level. But lawmakers and administration officials could theoretically take action to change the practices of PBMs hired to administer prescription benefits through Medicaid.
The state Department of Human Services hires managed care organizations (MCOs) to administer Medicaid benefits. Those companies in turn hire PBMs to handle prescription benefits and reimburse pharmacies.
When a PBM reimburses a pharmacy for a prescription picked up by a Medicaid patient, pharmacists receive a sum based on both the cost of the drug itself and a dispensing fee intended to cover the costs like bottles and printed labels.
But pharmacists told lawmakers that, in some cases, the dispensing fees are as low as $1 or $3, causing particular strain for pharmacies in areas with high rates of Medicaid enrollment. 
In some cases, reimbursement rates don’t cover what the pharmacy paid for the drug. Deron Schultz, CEO of Minnich’s Pharmacy in York, said that he regularly loses money dispensing Biktarvy, a brand name HIV medication that he called a matter of “life or death” for his patients. He also listed other, more common drugs like certain blood pressure and cholesterol medications, depending on the PBM reimbursing him.

Pharmacy trade groups believe the low reimbursement rates violate at least the spirit of the contract that Medicaid MCOs sign with the state’s Department of Human Services. That contract states pharmacy reimbursements must accurately reflect the cost of a drug and “the pharmacist’s professional services and cost to dispense the prescription.”
Val Arkoosh, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, testified her agency is unable to see whether or not a pharmacy profits when it dispenses drugs to Medicaid patients, but does know how much the managed care organization and PBM pay them and their rationale for doing so. 
Moreover, Arkoosh stressed that her department created a grievance process for pharmacists if they believe they’re being treated unfairly by PBM’s contracted with MCOs providing Medicaid services.
“[The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association] had the opportunity to review the draft agreement language,” Arkoosh said. “DHS received comments and several changes were incorporated into the agreement based on those.”
Lawmakers also asked panelists about the possibility of moving Pennsylvania’s Medicaid plans to what’s called a “single PBM” system. 
That’s what states like Ohio and Kentucky did when facing similar issues.
Instead of allowing MCOs to hire PBMs to handle prescription benefits, those states now hire a single PBM to act more as an administrator across their Medicaid plans. That’s allowed those states to set terms like reimbursement rates for pharmacies to ensure they aren’t losing money dispensing prescriptions.
According to reports, the move has not only helped pharmacies in those states, but saved taxpayers’ millions of dollars.
Arkoosh, however, urged some caution in using those reports as an indication of what could happen if Pennsylvania did the same. She said because the commonwealth has regulated the middlemen in ways those states hadn’t when they switched to a single PBM model for Medicaid, it’s unlikely the state would see the same level of savings.
However, she said there may still be merit and that DHS is looking into the possibility.
“That may be the right policy decision for a whole host of other reasons, but I’m not sure it’s going to save the commonwealth money,” she said. “We are deep in that analysis”
Testifying pharmacists, meanwhile, also brought up the possibility of requiring PBMs administering Medicaid plans to pay a minimum dispensing fee of around $10 for every prescription filled, on top of a reimbursement for the cost of the drug itself.
Ultimately, lawmakers said they will continue to look at the issues.
“This is an issue that we’re really going to stay focused on,” Ward said. “We will continue to have these meetings.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway officials told lawmakers they would “dig in” to solve utility easement concerns raised by leaders of multiple cities and organizations — but also defended its “good outcomes” and said the easement process is complicated.
Those problems, raised at an earlier meeting of the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee, include high fees for permits and a lack of consistent communication from the company on active projects.
City officials from four different Montana towns have brought issues to the Legislature.
Several BNSF employees spoke to the committee on Tuesday. The issue of easements, which also touches the state’s efforts to increase rural broadband, came to a public head earlier this summer during another ETIC meeting.
BNSF defended its process, saying how to grant easements, and running cables near tracks, is complicated because it needs to be safe and pointed to examples of where they’ve had successful partnerships. Consistency with the permit process, including communication and how much the utility permits will cost, has been the crux of the issue.
“The vast majority of those permits are processed and completed within a reasonable amount of time and allow for good outcomes on those projects,” Matt Jones, a BNSF lobbyist told the committee. “We also work with cities and towns local governments on a wide array of other real estate projects, and we are committed, as with the utility permits with these other community-based projects, to good outcomes, and we often are willing to agree to low-cost leases, often donations in order to get these projects done for the benefit of the community.”
As for two towns — Thompson Falls and Colstrip — that had serious concerns with the BNSF permit process, Jones apologized and said he’d “dig in” to see what went wrong. Thompson Falls waited months for communication from BNSF, while Colstrip was forced to pay an expensive fee for a utility permit. In Colstrip’s case, the project was being funded by grant money that had an expiration date — it became a choice of either completing a needed infrastructure project at high cost or wait and potentially lose out on the money altogether.
“And I’m extremely sorry, personally and on behalf of BNSF that the process has been so difficult for those two situations,” Jones told the committee.
But other local leaders, NaDean Brown, the mayor of Richey, and Steve Zachmann the mayor of Baker, pointed to problems they’ve had with the railroad company. 
“I think I’d like to reiterate the request for some expediency and a format to follow something a little more standard,” Zachmann said. “We’ve got a number of issues.”
Zachmann said trains sometimes stand still over railway crossings and BNSF has not communicated well on the issue, adding, “my most recent letter of 2023, has gone so far unanswered.”
Jones said that BNSF had interest in working with the League of Cities and Towns on education outreach about the permit process. The railroad company has reached agreements with energy co-ops and broadband providers in Montana, Jones said.
“I think we could come to an agreement in principle, with the League of Cities and Towns, in terms of, you know, what the expectations should be there. I think, our track record with the other organizations we’ve worked with, we do a good job of meeting those expectations,” Jones told the committee.
Committee chairman Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said it was “important” the issue got resolved.
“After today’s presentation, it sounds like many of these communities and businesses that we’re seeing deal with the railroads are being treated more like hostages than partnerships,” Zolnikov said. “And yes, there are solutions, but the solution is to call one person in the entire state, which is a reaction to a problem, not a process that gives clarity and a route forward.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BNSF-JH-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

Wes Moore, left, and Comptroller Brooke Lierman at the Sept. 10, 2025, meeting of the Board of Public Works. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Board of Public Works approved $465 million Wednesday to expand the number of beds available for placement of foster children, in what state officials called a “critical” step toward meeting youth care needs.
The Department of Human Services contracts — $279 million for three year period and another $186 million for a two-year renewal — would be split between 31 child placement agencies statewide and would fund a total of 2,013 placement beds, an increase of 4.8% from the current levels.
Expanding the number of beds prevents out-of-state placements and reduces the number of children forced into extended stays in hotels and hospitals when other space is not available, said Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López.
“Ideally, we don’t want them [youth] to get to the point where they have to remain in a hospital at all,” López told Maryland Matters after the board meeting. “And the expansion of beds is one of those solutions.”
The contracts will support both treatment foster care services (TFC), for youth with emotional, behavioral or psychological challenges, and independent living program (ILP) services, which help youth in foster care prepare for independent living. While the number of beds overall will grow from 1,920 to 2,013, the number of ILP beds will go from 290 to 335, a 15.5% increase.
This contract comes amid recent efforts by the Department of Human Services to “modernize the child welfare system,” said López, such as weekly staff meetings to review individual children’ s cases and the hiring of a hospital liaison who is in contact with hospitals caring for Department of Human Services youth.

“We are prioritizing the right bed and the right service for the child — that is our number one priority, and their safety is our highest priority,” López said after the board meeting.
In January 2023, when the Moore administration took office, the department was using “almost manual processes” for how it and its 24 local offices received youth into the system, and lacked statewide standards, López said.
“The contracts with these 31 providers really demonstrate, I think, a key first step in the state’s commitment to ensuring the best possible outcomes for our youth,” said Comptroller Brooke Lierman, one of three Board of Public Works members, with the governor and treasurer. “This is obviously just one of the legs of the stool of rebuilding our foster care system and our child placement system.
“Under this administration, what we have seen is a shift in priorities to make sure that we are taking care of the kids who have been left in a situation that they didn’t ask for and that is out of their control,” Lierman said.
López told the board that the department has been working to lower the number of hospital and hotel overstays since January 2023 — reducing the number of hospital overstays from 21 in February 2024 to 10 this month, and cutting the number of 54 to 11 in the same period.
The board agenda noted the number of youth in overstays was higher prior to January 2023, but there was no statewide tracking of youth overstays.
“While this is still 21 too many of our young people in Maryland, we are determined to get to zero for the first time in Maryland’s history,” Lopez said. “This work is not yet complete, but an important step in the right direction.”
Richard Barth, a distinguished professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, thinks the increase in beds and placement options is a “significant step forward.”
“Many youth who have been interviewed about their experience in care say they’re appreciative of the chance to be in care because they had no other good options, but that the services didn’t fit their needs very well,” Barth said Wednesday. “A greater supply of options for placements of children are likely to lead to a better match between what they actually need and what we’re providing them.”
Variations of placements, such as strengths in education or vocational issues, may appeal more to individuals, Barth said. He thinks there need to be more options for youth to enroll in residential schools and support for those looking to transition to higher education, as well as a larger effort to return youth to their homes.
“The quality of the independent living program that supports these youth who are in these placements is something that has been evolving for 30 years now — it needs to continue to evolve,” Barth said.

Since then, the question of whether the requirement to write the date on a mail ballot’s return envelope has been an issue in every election.","A Pennsylvania mail ballot envelope (Capital-Star photo)For more than a century the commonwealth’s Supreme Court has followed a presumption that voting rules passed by the legislature don’t violate the state constitution’s free and equal elections guarantee unless they make voting so difficult they amount to a disenfranchisement.
An attorney for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee argued before the high court Wednesday that opponents of the commonwealth’s troublesome requirement to put the date on mail-in ballots can’t make that claim.
“There’s nothing objectively difficult about completing the declaration or filling in the pre-printed date boxes on the ballot return envelope,” John Gore said, adding that in the 2024 presidential election, compliance with the date requirement neared 100%.
“If a voter wants to avoid the requirement entirely, the voter can simply vote in person, which is the most popular method of voting here in Pennsylvania. That’s the end of this case,” Gore said.
Chief Justice Debra Todd noted the trouble with the date requirement is that it’s not usually a question of whether a voter wants to comply, but a mistake that leads to the voter’s ballot being set aside.

In the 2022 election for governor, that caused about 10,000 mail-in ballots not to be counted, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania said. Even after the state redesigned ballot envelopes to prompt voters to write the month, day and last two digits of the year, 4,500 ballots were thrown out because of missing or incorrect dates in 2024.
“Even if this date requirement was not intended as a disenfranchisement trap. We now know that that’s what it has become,” ACLU of Pennsylvania lawyer Stephen Loney said.
An amendment to the Pennsylvania Election Code made voting by mail without an excuse an option for voters for the first time in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the question of whether the requirement to write the date on a mail ballot’s return envelope has been an issue in every election.
It has been challenged in several courts without a conclusive decision. Most recently, the Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to vote and the 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law.
Gore said the GOP filed a petition Tuesday asking the federal appeals court to rehear the case en banc, in hopes that a larger panel of judges would reach a different conclusion. 
The case before the Supreme Court stems from a special election for the state House in September 2024, when the Philadelphia Board of Elections disqualified 69 ballots because of missing dates.
“Two of those voters, Miss [Susan] Kinniry and Mr. [Brian] Baxter, were eligible lifelong voters whose most fundamental rights as Pennsylvania citizens are at stake,” Loney said, noting the state constitution clearly bars interference with the right to vote.
“However you try to slice it, a practice of disqualifying votes for non-compliance with a meaningless handwritten date requirement … it diminishes the right of suffrage, and it’s untied to any government interest,” Loney said.

The ACLU sued on their behalf and days before the 2024 election, the Commonwealth Court ruled that all mail-in ballots must be counted regardless of errors in the date. The Supreme Court granted a GOP request to stay the ruling, meaning that missing or incorrect dates would cause mail ballots to be set aside in the presidential election.
In analyzing whether the requirement is constitutional, the Supreme Court also asked lawyers for their thoughts on the level of scrutiny they should apply to determine whether some infringement on voting rights is permissible because it serves a clear governmental purpose.
In this and past cases on the date requirement, the GOP has argued the handwritten date serves purposes ranging from preventing election fraud to preserving the solemnity of voting. 
Election officials have said the date serves no purpose because every mail-in ballot is stamped with the date and time when it is returned to the election office. The state’s Statewide Uniform Registry of Voters system also allows officials to track each ballot with a bar code. 
“So given that we have two procedures to determine the actual date that it was received, what purpose can it possibly achieve for the voter to insert that date?” Todd asked Deputy Attorney General Brett Graham.
Graham described the requirement as part of a “belt and suspenders” approach to protecting the election system. 
Ben Fabens-Lassen, who represented the Philadelphia Board of Elections, said election officials have a process to segregate untimely ballots and said he disagreed with the “belt and suspenders” metaphor.
“The hand written date is more like this tie. It has no functional purpose and it serves no purpose in holding up my pants at all,” Fabens-Lassen said, drawing laughter from the court. “The date on a ballot declaration doesn’t serve any purpose and it doesn’t solve any actual or imagined problem.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0679-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

A transgender sheriff’s deputy seeking gender-affirming medical care through a county-operated health plan in central Georgia was handed a loss by a federal court Tuesday.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a trial court’s decision in favor of Houston County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Anna Lange and sent the case back to the lower court.
“After everything I’ve been through, it’s crushing to know I will have to continue to fight to get what a jury already said I was entitled to,” Lange said in a statement. “This should never have happened to me, and it shouldn’t happen to anyone else.”
Lange has served with the Houston County Sheriff’s Department since 2006. She came out as transgender and began to medically transition in 2017, according to court documents. She sued the county in 2019 after seeking gender-affirming surgery and being denied because the county’s insurance policy excludes “drugs for sex change surgery” and “services and supplies for a sex change and/or the reversal of a sex change.”
In 2022, a federal judge in Georgia ruled in Lange’s favor that an employer cannot exclude or deny coverage for transition-related medical treatments from its employee health insurance plan. Judge Marc T. Treadwell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Macon, cited Bostock v. Clayton County, a U.S. Supreme Court case out of Georgia affirming that transgender people are protected from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Houston County appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, where last May a three-judge panel initially upheld the lower court’s ruling. But in August, the appeals court vacated that ruling and granted a rehearing in front of the full court.
In Tuesday’s ruling, the full court cited United States v. Skrmetti, a 2025 U.S. Supreme Court case in which justices upheld a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Justices found that the ban was not discriminatory because they said it was based on a patient’s age and medical need rather than their sex or transgender status.
“The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Skrmetti applies equally here,” reads the 11th Circuit’s opinion. “The County’s policy does not pay for a sex change operation for anyone regardless of their biological sex. … Lange is a natal man. If Lange were instead a natal woman who wanted a female-to-male sex change, the insurance policy would not pay for it. Or if Lange were a natal woman who sought coverage for the same male-to-female sex change that Lange received (perhaps for a male dependent), the County’s policy would operate in the same way—it would deny coverage. Nothing about the policy exclusion turns on whether the County’s employee is a man or woman.”
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Nancy Abudu wrote that the majority’s opinion echoed arguments opposing past laws banning interracial marriage and “serve as fodder for those who oppose legal rights for transgender people.”
“Lange was denied coverage, and thus access, to medically necessary treatment by a healthcare coverage exclusion that limits an adult’s control over their own body,” Abudu wrote. “The importance of bodily autonomy crosses political and religious lines and has been illustrated by, for example, the recent challenges to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines. … Our Constitution does not permit courts to pick and choose which people warrant protection under the law based on the personal views of a subset of the population.”
In a statement, Lange’s lawyers expressed confidence that she will prevail at trial.
“While we are deeply disappointed in the court’s decision, we remain focused on vigorously fighting for Anna’s right to medically necessary healthcare and will continue to do so as the case proceeds,” said attorney Jill Grant of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.

The General Assembly is meeting in special session to revise the state’s eight congressional districts so Republicans are likely to win seven instead of the six they currently hold. The Missouri House has already approved the map sought by Trump, who on Tuesday demanded on social media that the Senate do the same.
“The Missouri Senate must pass this Map now, AS IS, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the ‘Show Me State,’ and across the Country,” Trump wrote.
To push the bill to final passage by Friday, Republicans had to get the two bills passed in the House into position for committee hearings on Thursday. But before that could take place, the chamber had to vote on rules for the session and Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin rolled out revisions intended to make House bills the Senate’s top priority.
And to get those revisions passed, they voted to shut off debate — using a once-rare motion known as the previous question. This year saw a major break from tradition, when Republicans used the motion to slam through partisan priorities at the end of the regular session in May.
It was the first time since 2017 when the previous question was used during a regular session.
The proposed rule changes triggered a Democratic-led debate that consumed two hours before Republicans forced a vote.
For about two hours, Democrats accused the Republicans of cheating by substituting the new rules instead of using the rules used during this year’s regular session — and for the veto session that took place just minutes before the chamber convened for the special session.
“For those of you that are going to be here for a few years, why would you give away your power just to make today a little bit easier?” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. “That doesn’t make any sense, and it really saddens me, because I don’t know where it stops.”
State Sen. Stephen Webber, D-Columbia, looks to the Senate dais in a disagreement over Senate rules (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The new rules were not distributed before the session convened and many Republicans were not informed in advance the changes were coming.
State Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence, said he was given the new rules and the bill on congressional maps approved in the Missouri House with the expectation he would be an automatic vote in favor of both. But Webber’s point was valid, he said, and he’s not ready to go along.
“I’m nobody’s puppet. I will never be anybody’s puppet,” Nicola said. “I’m not going to come down here and be expected to rubber stamp anything. That is not what I was elected to do.”
But when the chamber voted on the previous question, Nicola went along.
The previous question motion is used commonly in the Missouri House, but until this year it was considered a last resort in the Senate. When the votes were held, Democrats started calling the presiding officer of the Senate “Speaker” instead of “President.”
“There are no speakers in the Missouri Senate,” said state Sen. Jason Bean of Holcomb, who was presiding at the time.
Following the vote, the House bills were read and the Senate will meet at 9 a.m. Thursday to move them to committees for hearings later in the day.
 Flipping the 5th District

The Republicans’ target is the 5th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, a Democrat who has been in office since 2005. The map being considered would split the district into pieces, putting portions in the 4th and 6th districts and adding enough Republican votes to what remains to flip the district to the GOP.
Gov. Mike Kehoe also wants lawmakers to pass a state constitutional amendment raising the majority requirement for passing constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition. 
Instead of a statewide majority deciding the questions, initiative proposals would have to win majorities statewide and in every congressional district. That would allow as few as 5% of voters to decide the question.
But it is Trump’s insistence on a new congressional map to shore up the GOP’s shaky majority in the U.S. House that is the main focus of the special session.
During a caucus of the Republican senators Wednesday, Trump called Kehoe and spoke to the members through the governor’s phone.
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, insisted in an interview that the special session was not called just because Trump wanted it. The proposed new map puts all of Schroer’s county into the 3rd Congressional District — it is now split between the 3rd and the 2nd districts — and he said that will keep a community together in the same district.
But when asked whether Kansas City, which is almost entirely in the 5th District but would have its population split among three in the proposed map, deserved the same consideration, Schroer said it did not.
“Donald Trump is encouraging Republicans to grow a spine, and stop bending the knee to the Democrats to avoid filibusters like we did in 2022,” Schroer said. “It’s really helped and it’s binding the Republican Party back together.”
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, D-Kansas City, compares the State Senate to the House, remarking about the lack of debate allowed (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Democrats have vowed to challenge any new map in court and plans are being formed to force a statewide referendum on the bill. On Monday, Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh will hold a hearing on a lawsuit filed by the NAACP challenging the legal basis for calling a special session.
At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said Republicans are rigging congressional elections because the policies they have pursued since Trump took office again are proving extremely unpopular.
And, he said, Republicans are trying to protect Trump from being shown to be a friend of deceased child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“The thing that frightens them the most, the thing that keeps them up at night, the thing that sends cold sweat down their back as they rub elbows at their elite country clubs is that if Democrats retake the House, they will release the Epstein files,” Beck said.
The Capitol was filled with opponents of the redistricting plan on Wednesday. And as the Senate adjourned for the day, Suzanne Till of Dent County said she would be back to continue the opposition on Thursday.
“If we don’t at least make a presence, then they’re going to railroad us,” Till said. “And also, I’m just gobstopped that they would just so openly, and brazenly, try to snatch away voters’ voices.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_beck3-scaled-e1757547726290-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana Speaker of the House Brandon Ler criticized an 8% tax hike in Missoula County and said the increase is evidence more property tax reform is needed in the Treasure State.
“Montanans deserve stability, not surprise increases every budget cycle,” said Ler, a Republican from Savage, in a statement earlier this week. “It’s time to have a serious discussion about putting limits on local mill increases in future sessions so families can plan and budget with confidence.”
But Missoula County Commissioners said the impact on residential homeowners actually amounts to an 11% decrease — and the dollars are mostly going to paying a living wage for staff to provide services residents expect.
Even with the decrease for residential payers, the county budget can be larger because legislative changes mean other classes of property taxpayers, such as agriculture, pay more, said Chris Lounsbury, chief administrative officer for Missoula County.
He said the change is the Montana Legislature’s response to an earlier reappraisal that resulted in a roughly 35% burden shift onto residential payers in Missoula, and the current adjustment pushes roughly 21% back to other classes.
“Both sides of the aisle did a good job of pointing out whenever you change tax policy, it does have impacts in ways you can’t 100% predict,” Lounsbury said.
Lawmakers passed a property tax reform package in the 2025 Montana Legislature after intense debate, but on behalf of Republican leadership in the House, Ler said the increase in Missoula “highlights the need for future reforms.”
Property taxpayers also have been protesting their reappraisals this year, albeit not to the degree they filed appeals in 2023.
Representatives of local governments, however, pushed back at the idea of further curtailing their ability to collect taxes.
House Republicans call for more reform
In the statement from House Republicans, Ler said lawmakers are prepared to consider in the 2027 legislative session proposals that would “place reasonable caps on local mill increases.”
“Such measures would provide predictability for taxpayers, bring accountability to local budgets, and prevent families from being blindsided by sudden hikes,” the news release said.
The Legislature currently caps local government mill increases at roughly half the rate of inflation, and a spokesperson for Ler said the Speaker doesn’t have a specific number in mind for where to move the cap at this point.
In the 2025 session, the Legislature passed a bill to require local governments to represent voted levies in dollars instead of mills — because mills are confusing to the general public.
A mill is a tax rate equal to $1 for every $1,000 in taxable value. If a county levies 25 mills, the cost to a property taxpayer is $25 for every $1,000 in taxable value.
Jennifer Olson, with the Montana League of Cities and Towns, said local governments already are making that change from House Bill 20, which takes effect on Oct. 1.
“I think there’s a general sentiment that provides transparency,” Olson said.
However, she also said it’s important for local governments to be part of the conversation about property taxes from the beginning because they are on the “ground floor” when it comes to providing basic services, things like police and fire.
Municipalities account for roughly 10% to 15% of total property tax bills depending on the district and voted mills, she said.
Currently, she said, the cap at half the rate of inflation — averaged over the previous three years — limits the ability of local governments to maintain its responsibilities, such as to manage its sewer treatment, or even to grow responsibly.
“What is it, holistically, that a community needs to be able to bring in businesses or bring in tourism dollars or to support a large business economy?” Olson said.
But she said the months between legislative sessions are a good time to continue the discussion, especially because there’s no single answer.
“It is a complex system, and there are complex needs out there,” Olson said.
Missoula County responds
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Missoula County Commissioners said their budget already falls under the half-the-rate-of-inflation cap set by the Montana Legislature.
“Even with this limit, Missoula County has not levied the full amount of available mills for the past several years — including this year,” commissioners said. “Any statements implying otherwise come across as willful attempts to obscure the facts to score cheap political points.”
A budget presentation from the county showed the way the legislative change affected various properties.
For example, one home in Lolo with a higher market value this year compared to last would actually see a lower taxable value and pay $179.10 less in taxes, or 9% less — even with the overall tax increase in the county.
Lounsbury said that’s because mills get applied across all property tax classes. Since the tax values in residential went down, the money generated from residential properties will be smaller too.
“It basically shifts so those mills will raise less money in residential and more money in other property tax classes,” Lounsbury said.
Toward the end of the legislative session this year, some lawmakers said that shift was too large, although others said they didn’t have constituents complaining to them about the taxes big corporations pay.
In their email, Missoula County Commissioners said the county has proposed “innovative alternatives” to fund local governments besides property taxes, but “unfortunately, Speaker Ler has opposed those efforts.”
“We hope enough legislators on both sides of the aisle will continue working to reform the state’s property tax system in a way that won’t hamstring the revenue counties need to protect public safety, answer 9-1-1 calls, pave and plow roads, run elections and provide other services Montanans rely on,” the commissioners said.
Lounsbury, though, said he believes Ler, the county, and every legislator is “trying to do their best in a really complicated — really, really, complicated — (property tax) landscape.”
“There is no such thing as a perfect tax system,” Lounsbury said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-579-copy-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-09-10 19:57:40.081069

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas education commissioner Randy Watson announced Wednesday he plans to retire from the position he has held since 2014.
Watson said he will remain in the position until the Kansas State Board of Education hires a new commissioner.
“For 10 years, it’s been my pleasure to serve the board,” Watson said in a news release following Wednesday’s board meeting, where he made the announcement. “They’ve done remarkable work and have had many accomplishments over that time. I’m proud to have been a small part of that.”
Board chair Cathy Hopkins praised Watson for bringing stability to the board.
“He’s always asking, ‘How can I make this board function on behalf of Kansas education as its best possible peak?’ He exemplifies that so well,” Hopkins said.
The news release said Watson helped lead initiatives to improve literacy, strengthen the accreditation system for K-12 schools, and redesign schools to meet student needs and create stronger pathways for post-graduation success. He also visited all 286 school districts multiple times during his time as commissioner, the news release said.
Watson received widespread attention in 2022 for making insensitive comments about American Indians during an online education conference. The board suspended him for a month without pay, and he apologized for the remarks.
Before he was named education commissioner, Watson was the superintendent for McPherson public schools. His also has experience as a teacher, principal and coach.

(Photo by Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report. 
The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years. 
The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year. 
“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said. 
Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields. 
“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”
Coal down, wind and solar up
In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state. 
The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation. 
Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”
Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.” 
Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024. 
“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”
The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants. 
According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. 
Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.
Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.
“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.” 
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.” 
Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.
According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024. 
“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.” 
‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected 
Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers. 
According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years. 
Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years. 
“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.” 
Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”
“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”
‘Big beautiful’ law changes timeline for tax credits
Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032. 
The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits. 
Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report. 
“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said. 
But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa. 
“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.

Sept. 10, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceIn continuing testimony from a hearing held earlier this summer, the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday invited AI watchdogs and business representatives to testify on a set of bills regulating the development of artificial intelligence systems and creating criminal penalties for individuals using AI for reasons outside of the law.
The committee heard testimony from the bills’ sponsor, state Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport, the committee’s chair, and other proponents in June.
Lightner welcomed additional comments on her proposed policies, which ranged from praise for potential security measures in AI development, to concerns that regulation at the state level could create a patchwork of differing rules. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Of the two pieces of legislation, Wednesday’s discussions largely focused on House Bill 4668, which would require developers training AI on broad sets of data to implement a number of safety and security protocols beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The protocols would manage risks, including the creation and release of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapon or a cyberattack perpetrated or assisted by an AI model.
Felix De Simone, the organizing director of PauseAI US, pointed to the unpredictability of how AI systems make their decisions, warning that there’s a lack of oversight and a lack of accountability in how these systems are trained.
De Simone pointed to remarks from Jared Kaplan, the chief scientist for Anthropic, which develops the Claude AI chatbot. Kaplan told Time Magazine: “we’re not sure if we can rule out the risk – the specific risk being uplifting a novice terrorist, someone like Timothy McVeigh, to be able to make a weapon much more destructive than would otherwise be possible.”
His comment came during discussion on the safety measures taken in releasing the Claude Opus 4 model.
“In short, we might soon be building AI systems that have goals of their own, that have the ability to create weapons, including biological weapons, and that can act autonomously without human oversight for extended periods of time,” De Simone told the committee on Wednesday. “Experts are warning us that this is a recipe for disaster and instead of rolling the dice and gambling with an uncertain future, we should act now to make sure that these worst case scenarios of autonomous, weapon-capable AI systems don’t come to pass.”
However, Tyler Diers, the Midwest executive director for the technology trade association TechNet, said trying to regulate advanced AI models is a continuous moving target, calling for Michigan to see how regulation efforts play out in other states with policies further along in the process, or to commission a study or task force on the topic.
He also raised concerns about House Bill 4668’s requirements mandating independent third party audits.
“I think it’s worth noting that there are no established third party audit standards and expertise in AI safety auditing, even at the federal or international level,” Diers said. “Mandating that developers who are investing in AI innovation in the state provide untrammeled access to their research to an unaccredited third party without sufficient technical depth, could miss critical risks or flag false positives.”
In light of conversations held over the Summer, Lightner recommended the committee refer House Bill 4668 to the House Communications and Technology committee, with all 10 committee members in attendance approving the motion.
The committee did not vote on Lightner’s House Bill 4667, which creates three new felonies to prevent individuals from using AI to commit a crime.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Election officials from Louisiana are reacting to the death of ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot Wednesday afternoon during an event at a Utah university. 
Videos circulating on social media show Kirk seated under an open tent at an outdoor amphitheater venue on the Utah Valley University campus as he was fielding questions from a large crowd. The audience scattered after hearing a popping sound. Kirk appeared to recoil from an impact and began bleeding from his neck. Witnesses said he was answering a question about gang violence and shootings when he was shot.    
Police in Utah have said they have a person of interest in custody but did not indicate it was the shooting suspect.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called Kirk “a patriot in every sense of the word” in a social media post. The governor said he and first lady Sharon Landry were praying for Kirk, his wife Erika and their two children, along with the Turning Point USA organization that Kirk founded and led.
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on the platform X.
The governor also encouraged Kirk’s supporters to fly an American flag in his honor.
“He stood for the principles that made this country great: liberty, freedom, and prosperity, which are all of the things that the Left hates,” Landry added. 
Charlie Kirk dies after shooting at Utah Valley University

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, described Kirk as a “close friend and confidant” and said his death was “utterly devastating” in a statement.
“He will be sorely missed by so many,” Johnson said. “Every political leader must loudly and clearly decry this violence. Our prayers go out to his wife and young children. May he rest in peace.” 
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, said in an X post that he was “sad and digusted” to learn of Kirk’s death.
“Political violence is NEVER acceptable,” Scalise wrote. “The perpetrator of this horrific act must be held accountable … It’s past time for the incendiary rhetoric to come to an end, and we must see universal condemnation of this gruesome act.”
Eight years ago, Scalise barely survived a politically motivated mass shooting at a Virginia park where he and other GOP lawmakers were practicing for the annual congressional baseball game. Shooter James Hodgkinson also wounded a Capitol security officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist before being killed by return fire.
U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Madisonville, called Kirk a “courageous conservative” and said “his senseless death makes me sick,” in an X post.
“His legacy will live on through every freedom-loving American who watched his show, listened to his speeches, or attended one of Turning Point USA’s events,” Kennedy wrote.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, shared a brief prayer on Facebook and shared a post President Donald Trump made to his Truth Social platform that said “No one had or understood the Heart of the Youth in the United States better than Charlie.”
Without mentioning Kirk by name, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, offered his own prayer on social media: “May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ shield us, strengthen us, and forever defeat the evil that threatens our anointed Nation under God.”
In her own X post, U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, asked for prayers for Kirk’s family “as they begin this unimaginable walk.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill also said she was praying for Kirk. 
“The videos circulating are both shocking and disturbing, which seem entirely inadequate to describe this horrible event,” she said in a statement. “Political violence has no place in our society.” 
Democratic officials from Louisiana also shared their reaction to Kirk’s death.
“Violence is never the answer — not in politics, not in life,” U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans said in an X post. “We can disagree without dehumanizing, and we can debate without destruction. My prayers are with Charlie Kirk and his family.”
“The tragic death of Charlie Kirk is a reminder of the painful moment our country is living through,” U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields said on X. “No matter our political differences, violence is unacceptable and has no place at all in our democracy. My thoughts and prayers are with Charlie Kirk’s family, especially his wife and children, as they mourn this loss.”
The event where Kirk was fatally shot was typical of his many visits to college campuses where he fields questions from students, including those who challenge his conservative viewpoints.
The Turning Point USA chapter at Louisiana State University had planned to host Kirk for an Oct. 27 event on campus. In response to questions from The Reveille student newspaper, the LSU chapter provided a statement from its national office that confirmed Kirk’s death and asked for prayers for his family.
Derek Babcock, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, praised Kirk as “a bold truth-teller, a courageous leader, and a patriot who never shied away from defending the values that built this nation.” He also called on younger party members to carry on Kirk’s legacy.
“The enemies of truth may have silenced his voice, but they cannot extinguish the fire he lit in your hearts,” Babcock said in a statement. “In this dark hour, I urge you to rise up, carry forward the torch of faith and freedom, and show this nation that Charlie Kirk’s legacy will not be buried with him. It will live on in you.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)In a far-ranging online town hall meeting on Tuesday night, U.S. Congressman Troy Downing, a Republican from Montana’s Second District, stood lockstep with the Trump administration, including the use of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., tariffs and support for the controversial rollback of the “Roadless Rule.”
However, he expressed concerns about the economic upheaval for the Treasure State’s agricultural community.
Since his election in November 2024, Downing has held four “telephone town hall” events, taking questions from callers, while avoiding larger town-hall formats. The topics discussed on Tuesday followed the contours of national issues, including the use of military, the Epstein files and unflinching support for fossil-fuel energy. Downing’s district covers the central and eastern part of the state. Montana’s other representative in Congress is Rep. Ryan Zinke, also a Republican who served as Secretary of the Interior for a time during President Donald Trump’s first term.
The mostly question-and-answer format allowed selected callers to lob questions at Downing, and several focused on concerns about the Epstein files and the National Guard’s use in Washington, D.C., and other American cities.
Downing said he wanted full transparency when it comes to the Epstein files but was worried about naming victims who want to remain out of the public spotlight. However, during the conversation about the topic, Downing did not mention President Trump or a new evidence linking him to Epstein’s nefarious activities, which have emerged this week.
“Republicans are on the side of truth and transparency when it comes to securing justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,” Downing said. “While other politicians make grandstanding (gestures) and engage in political theater, I will continue to advocate for transparency and a process that leverages the maximum weight of the law while protecting victims of these heinous crimes.”
  National Guard and the military 

During the roughly 45 minutes dedicated to questions from callers, several asked about the Trump administration’s use of the military in Washington, D.C., and some veterans’ expressed concerns that the presence was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which at least one federal court has affirmed.
Downing said that he fully supported the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act, while also offering support of Trump’s authority to use emergency powers to send in the troops.
When the first caller, identified as “Charles from Huntley,” asked “why the United States Army is invading our national (capitol) Washington, D.C.,” and other cities, Downing responded unequivocally.
“I don’t agree with your basic premise there,” Downing said. “This is a shining example of the United States of America and crime has gone crazy. This is not a state. It falls under the federal government, and I think the president of the United States has the prerogative to make sure it’s safe. I am very proud that this president made a decision to do something to make sure that it’s safe.”
However, widely published statistics show crime rates were falling in D.C. before Trump’s call-up of the National Guard, and Downing’s claim that crime had fallen after has not been verified.
Another caller asked if Downing supported the concept of the Posse Comitatus Act as well as the U.S. Constitutional protection against the military being used against citizens, except in extreme circumstances.
Downing expressed support for both the Constitution while also offering support for the use of the military.
“Mr. Downing, will you affirm your commitment to the Constitution, specifically the principle of Posse Comitatus, and be sure that in cities like Chicago, the military is never used as a police force against civilians,” said John, a caller from Whitehall.
“There’s nothing particularly new here,” Downing responded, pointing to the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard at the southern border. “This is exigent circumstances. This was a state of emergency because of the special conditions of an emergency exists in D.C. He did keep the peace there and dealt with those, and I believe he was within his constitutional authority. I just don’t subscribe to your thought that any of these acts have been unconstitutional.”
  Roadless rule 

Downing also seemed to break with the majority of Montanans on the U.S. Forest Service’s attempts to repeal the so-called “Roadless Rule,” which protects more than 6 million acres of federal public forest land in Montana from having roads or vehicle traffic.
Polling data for Montana specifically on the rule was not available, but in an analysis of public comments when the rule was first proposed, 95% of the more than 1.6 million comments on the rule supported the measure.
Conservatives argue such policies have hurt the economy and the health of forests by not allowing for “management” and by letting forests grow more thick, leading to hotter, more intense fires. Others say that the rule prohibits timber harvest and robs taxpayers of the chance to make money from federal lands.
However, environmental groups say that the rule protects the wilderness and many endangered species, as well as provides carbon sinks to capture carbon generated by fossil fuels. Furthermore, surveys done by hunting and outdoors organization show a widespread support of the rule. For example, the Backwoods Hunters and Anglers have come out in strong opposition to the change.
“I think in order to be true stewards, we need that,” Downing said. “I am very supportive or repealing the roadless rule, because I think it helps protect us in Montana from having bigger, hotter, more destructive fires.”
  The economy, tariffs and a federal government shutdown 

Downing’s town hall also spent time touching on various economic issues, including the economy, Trump’s use of tariffs and an impending federal government shutdown that could happen when funding for the government expires at the end of September.
Downing said that if the Republicans had not passed the “big, beautiful bill,” Democrats would have led America off a financial cliff, and he defended massive tax cut continuations that the Congressional Budget Office has said will add trillions to the debt problem — an issue which Downing hit on several times.
However, Downing defended the move, saying that taxes would have risen to pre-COVID levels that would translate to an average of $1,280 for the average Montana family in his district. He said that a closer reading of the economic plans shows a different outcome. He said that the CBO scored the measure as if the American economy would remain flat, but Downing said the Republican plans will supercharge the economy and don’t factor in economic growth.
“If we just have 3% growth, which is not anything, you know, unachievable — actually, I think we can do much better than that — then we actually reduce our debt over 10 years that this reconciliation bill covers,” Downing said.
However, federal statistics show that in the past decade, gross domestic product only hit above 3% once, in 2021 after the pandemic when it rebounded from a negative, -2.16% to a positive 6.06%, something most economists point out as an statistical anomaly due to COVID-19. The 10-year average GDP growth sits at 2.46% through 2023, the most current yearly data available. The last time the economic growth eclipsed 3% was in 2005.
Meanwhile, Downing told constituents that he didn’t think that Congress would let all the federal government shut down. Instead, he thought that the Democrats and Republicans would come together to pass “continuing resolutions” to fund most — if not all — parts of the government for a period of time, possibly until the end of the calendar year, in order to negotiate a budget that will take support from Democratic Senators.
“Do I want to sign a continuing resolution? Absolutely not. But given the chance to get a little bit of runway to get these bills through, hopefully by the end of the year, is a reasonable place so that we can start to get back to regular order and start doing the business of the people,” he said.
Finally, Downing echoed Trump saying that the U.S. economy may experience some temporary pain due to tariffs, but said he supported the president’s use of them in order to bring about better trade deals with foreign adversaries and friends alike. He didn’t explain what he meant by temporary pain, or how an economy being weighed down by tariffs would necessarily continue to grow at more than 3%.
“What I strongly believe is that the president is using tariffs to try to get to a point where we have fair and equitable trading agreements with our trading partners,” Downing said. “And I think a lot of this has been successful — incredibly successful.”
He said that instead of returning the money from tariffs to the American people that the Trump administration should put the money toward paying off the national debt.
“As a lot of people have said from the beginning, including the president, there might be some short-term discomfort until we get to a point that actually is a good place for the United States of America, for, you know, our industry, our production and some of these things are national security issues to make sure we are producing what we need to produce here,” Downing said.
In maybe one of the few areas where Downing began departing from the Trump policies was in the ripple effects the tariffs have caused in the agricultural sector. Many have expressed concerns that the trade deals lessened the value of Montana’s agricultural products, while making imported equipment and parts for agricultural operations more expensive.
“One thing that I have been very vocal with the administration about is agriculture,” Downing said. “People are concerned about the short-term increases in input prices, in cost of equipment, parts, and all that stuff. The biggest concern is knowing where things are going to settle in two months, in three months or six months. I’ve been very vocal with this administration that it’s hard for our producers, for our small businesses, to plan in the future with that ambiguity. I’m hoping  we start to see some stability in that short of time. I do think we end up settling with more jobs on shore, more manufacturing on shore, and more businesses investing in the United States of America.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-34-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959
,California,2025-09-10 22:47:13+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s bid to fast-track Delta tunnel stalls again,Rachel Becker,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/09/delta-tunnel-fast-track-dead/,"Water wonks say the proposal to speed the multibillion Delta tunnel project could rise again. ‘This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project,’ one opponent said.","In summary
Water wonks say the proposal to speed the multibillion Delta tunnel project could rise again. ‘This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project,’ one opponent said. 


In a blow to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ambitions to replumb the Delta, California lawmakers once again punted on his plan to fast-track a deeply controversial $20 billion tunnel project that would funnel more water to the south. 
Multiple sources in the Legislature say the clock has run out on a sweeping measure that would overhaul permitting, financing and other road blocks to the Delta tunnel project. The news comes as lawmakers and Newsom race to reach a megadeal that encompasses carbon trading, wildfire funding, energy transmission, and refinery issues. The governor’s office did not respond to CalMatters’ inquiry. 
While supporters acknowledge the tunnel bill has hit a dead end for now, this isn’t the first time Newsom has tried to fast track the project. And water watchers expect that it won’t be the last. 
“Even if action is delayed this year, the need for modern delta conveyance has never been greater,” said Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the State Water Contractors, a staunch supporter of the bill, in a statement. “The need is urgent, the support is broad, and the time to move forward is now.” 
Lawmakers representing Delta communities called the failure to fast-track the bill a relief. They have long said that building a tunnel to reroute water around the Delta would devastate communities, fish and local farms. 
“It’s going to be incredibly disruptive to my communities,” state Sen. Jerry McNerney, a Democrat from Stockton, told CalMatters. “They made a good fight, but we just were too unified for them to have any progress.” 
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City, said no amount of compensation for Delta communities would make up for the project’s lasting harm. 
“Once a short-sighted policy, always a short-sighted policy,” she said in a statement. “We will continue to stand strong and fight for the Delta and the communities who call it home.”
‘Let’s get this built’
The proposed tunnel, more formally known as the Delta Conveyance Project, would extend 45 miles from the Sacramento River to a reservoir near Livermore, bypassing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which serves as a critical hub for California’s water supply. 
It’s the latest iteration of a decades-old plan to funnel water deliveries from Northern California around, rather than through, the Delta — with the goal of shoring up water supplies for 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of agriculture largely in the central and southern parts of the state. 
Planning for the project remains underway, though it is fiercely opposed by conservationists, Tribes, Delta cities and counties, and the fishing industry. 
They fear the loss of water supplies, environmental degradation and years of construction that they say will make some towns uninhabitable. The state’s own analysis warned that a Delta tunnel would put salmon at risk. 
Newsom introduced the streamlining bill earlier this spring as a budget add-on, a strategy he’s used before that bypasses more extensive input from lawmakers. 
“We’re done with barriers  — our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future,” Newsom said May. “Let’s get this built.” 
Stalled, but not dead
The tunnel bill aimed to flatten roadblocks related to land acquisition, water rights decisions, funding and litigation. Delta lawmakers pushed back against it, as well as Newsom’s strategy of using the budget process to shortcut deliberations. 
“Drying out the north just to water the south doesn’t make it better at all, and it doesn’t make it fair,” Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a Democrat from Elk Grove, said in May. 
Lawmakers tabled decisions on the bills until later in the session, and the Newsom administration continued to push for both the tunnel and the streamlining effort. 
Pierre, with the State Water Contractors, told CalMatters that the failure to fast track the project didn’t reflect Legislative opposition to the tunnel itself. 
“We had vote cards that demonstrated the majority in both houses,” Pierre told CalMatters. “This was not a function of a lack of support for the bill.” 
But McNerney said he thought the political cost for the administration became too high. 
“I think the governor realized that he’s got other battles to fight,” McNerney said. “It’s just not worth taking that battle to the wall.” 
Jon Rosenfield, science director with the San Francisco Baykeeper, said he hoped this was the last effort by the Newsom administration to “grease the skids” for a Delta tunnel. 
But, he added, “This is the zombie offspring of the zombie project … You understand if I don’t necessarily believe that this is the end.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/022525-DeltaTunnelHood-FG-CM-32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Emotional testimony spilled out Wednesday as about 75 people pleaded with South Dakota social services officials to halt a proposed rule change that testifiers said could drastically slash Medicaid reimbursements for LifeScape, the state’s primary caretaker for people with complex disabilities.
“You cannot change this funding and ask us to ‘hope’ that it’s OK,” said Erin Horstmeyer, whose disabled son received care from LifeScape before he died. 
“Families like mine, the people in this room, have lived on hope every single day of our lives,” she said. “All we do is hope, because we don’t know what the future holds for kids that have multiple disabilities.”

At issue is the state Department of Social Services’ plan to revise the methodology it uses to reimburse providers through Medicaid, the joint federal-state program providing low-income health insurance and disability assistance.
A rule dating to the 1980s allows LifeScape to be exempt from the state’s typical Medicaid reimbursement rates, according to LifeScape’s Leah Orsack, resulting in more funding for the unique care the organization provides. According to Kristin Tuttle, also of LifeScape, the proposed rule change would reduce LifeScape’s annual funding by about $9.7 million. LifeScape’s locations in Sioux Falls and Rapid City serve more than 3,300 children and 500 adults in South Dakota.
At the outset of the public hearing at the state’s One Stop building in Sioux Falls, however, Department Secretary Matt Althoff said the initial proposal that sparked the outcry would no longer be pursued — news that surprised both the organization and those in attendance. 
He said the proposal came about due to the department needing to modernize its decades-old reimbursement system in alignment with federal guidance. He said the methodology for reimbursing LifeScape will still need an update, but did not offer specifics on a new plan. 
“We have to modernize the methodology,” Althoff said. But when pressed on whether LifeScape’s bottom line would hold steady, he conceded, “We don’t know that.” 
Althoff also acknowledged, “South Dakota is a lot worse off without LifeScape. We need LifeScape to be there.”

The two-hour hearing was filled with tearful testimony from parents and advocates describing how LifeScape’s outpatient therapies and specialized programs helped their children walk, talk and participate in daily life. Many stressed there are no comparable providers in the state, particularly after Althoff suggested others exist. 
Some attendees bristled at Althoff responding to speakers during the testimony period of the public hearing, saying it gave the impression the department was dominating a forum meant for public input. One attendee attempted to seize the microphone from Althoff and spoke over him when he declined. 
The advocates urged the department to delay any changes until the real-world impacts are better understood.
“At first, I thought this proposal must have been the work of some detached politician, cause we have plenty of those. But no, it’s you, the Department of Social Services. The man in the tan suit,” said parent Semehar Ghebrekidan, pointing to Althoff. 
A panel of state lawmakers, the Legislative Rules Review Committee, is scheduled to consider the rules package on Oct. 7. Until then, Althoff said the department would continue negotiations with LifeScape.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0735-scaled-e1757543641536-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

Residents have a 30-day period to appeal the decision in state environmental court.

Image courtesy of the Town of Colchester
Colchester officials have given preliminary approval to a proposed $8 million lakefront lodging development — a move that has angered many residents who now plan to appeal the decision.
Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp. describes its development as a “20-room inn” with five “cottage-style” units built into the slope overlooking Malletts Bay to house a restaurant and event space, with almost 100 parking spots mainly on the opposite side of East Lakeshore Drive.
Opposed residents dispute that characterization of the development — called The H at Malletts Bay — and continue to raise concerns about its potential effect on water quality, increased traffic and pedestrian safety, and setting a precedent for large development along the scenic waterfront.
“We are disappointed with the decision, believe it misstates many of the facts and contains flawed analysis. The group is seriously considering taking an appeal,” said Brice Simon, a lawyer representing a group of town residents.
Residents have also objected to the board trying to reframe its own definition of what constitutes an inn, Simon said, because the town’s development regulations do not allow hotels or motels in the lakeshore district.
An inn, by the town’s rules, is an establishment containing at least six rooms but no more than 20 for living or sleeping purposes. No more than 40% of the rooms may contain apartment-type furnishings such as a kitchen, bath, living space and separate bedroom.
The project proposes 20 rooms, all or almost all of which contain typical apartment-type furnishings, according to an email shared by town officials. The floor plans submitted show such features in at least 10 of the 20 rooms, he further noted.
“There has never been a satisfactory explanation from the developer as to how the project meets the definition of an inn. Therefore, it is a hotel or motel, and is not an allowed or conditional use in the district. Therefore, the application should be denied as a matter of law,” Simon wrote in an email.
The town’s Development Review Board issued its 46-page decision on Sept. 3. Residents said they expect to discuss the matter at the board’s meeting Wednesday night. 
Development Review Board members did not respond to a request for comment.
The inn proposal is not on Wednesday meeting agenda, and the board does not plan to discuss it at the meeting, according to Cathyann LaRose, director of planning and zoning.
“The DRB, as a quasi-judicial board, is prohibited from discussing items which are not on an agenda or part of an active deliberative session. The Hazelett properties have no active applications and a decision has already been issued for the preliminary plat application. The Board will not and cannot discuss this property amongst themselves or with members of the public,” she wrote in an email Wednesday. 
The developers and their representatives did not respond Wednesday to a request from VTDigger to comment on the residents’ concerns.

‘Grossly negligent’
“This is one of the most egregious town decisions I have ever read,” resident Jack Scully said in an email.
“They’ve sold our souls for $8 million. Shame on them,” Jeanne Welch, another resident, said.
By rubber-stamping a large development that requires building into the slope right against the bay, the board is “ignoring” a town ordinance on what could be built there, what constitutes a traffic study, and its responsibility to uphold the state’s Shoreland Protection Act, said Lori Barg, a West Lakeshore Drive resident. 
“It seems like they look for every hole in their regulations and miss the heart of the regulations,” she wrote in an email.
It’s “grossly negligent of the DRB” to approve a plan that has severe environmental and ecological impacts on Malletts Bay and on Lake Champlain, said resident Julie Elmore, one of many who recently organized to oppose the project.
“Colchester is abdicating its responsibility for water quality in Malletts Bay,” said Marilyn Sowles, a former selectboard member and a member of the resident group Save the Bay, which has also pointed to possible environmental detriments the project poses, as well its inconsistency with the 2019 Town Plan that provides an outline for land use and town development.
In meetings this year, Sowles voiced her opposition to the town allowing developers to cut down many trees and combine the two small Hazelett lots to make way for an “inn,” restaurant, spa and event center that would connect to the new sewer being built on Lakeshore Drive, causing significant traffic delays.
“It appears that the $16.7 million Malletts Bay sewer, supposedly being built to protect water quality, is instead enabling additional development along the lakeshore with no consideration by either the town of Colchester or the Colchester Development Review Board for how this new development will impact water quality,” Sowles said. “There will be no stormwater treatment along the lakefront and 43% of the existing trees will be cut. Stormwater runoff will only be treated on the opposite side of West Lakeshore Drive.”

When the sewer project was discussed last year, many worried the town was investing in future development over environmental mitigation, but officials disputed those arguments. Town Manager Aaron Frank at the time said the new sewer line would not have the capacity to support excess development, citing limited roadway capacity and existing land use regulations on East and West Lakeshore drives.
Prior to that, the town reworked zoning for Lakeshore Drive in 2022, eliciting the same environmental and over-development concerns.
Hazelett, which has long owned the plots, demolished the vacant Beach and Boat Motel in 2017 and has contemplated rebuilding there since, according to the Colchester Sun.
Residents have a 30-day period to appeal the decision in the environmental division of the Vermont Superior Court. The preliminary plat approval is one step in the review process. The applicant has to apply for a final plat review, which will include at least another hearing and final decision, according to LaRose.
The environmental court is the last recourse for the concerned residents, Elmore said. It is tragic, she added, that they have to incur legal fees to fight a development the town should have rejected based on its own rules.
“To me, the decision is unconscionable,” Welch said. “It guarantees that West Lakeshore will be immeasurably more congested and unsafe for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists than it already is. Not to mention the loss of that iconic view. All to provide a playground for the rich and line a developer’s pockets.”

Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with all Democrats to advance the amendment.The move by Schumer was the latest attempt in Congress to force Republicans on the record about the Trump administration’s announcement in July that it would not release any further materials from the federal sex trafficking case against Epstein.“If Republicans vote no, they'll be saying to the American people, you should not see the Epstein files,” Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. “I asked my Republican colleagues, after all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, ‘Why won't you vote yes?’”The financier, who for years surrounded himself with powerful and influential figures, died awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019.

Free.,"After near-deportation, attorneys seek protections for immigrant children in HHS care",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-near-deportation-attorneys-seek-protections-immigrant-children-hhs-care,,"WASHINGTON — Attorneys for a group of 10 Guatemalan children who were nearly deported late last month asked a federal judge during a hearing Wednesday to grant protections for all unaccompanied minors in the care of a Department of Health and Human Services agency handling refugee resettlement.Efrén C. Olivares, the lead attorney of the National Immigration Law Center representing the unaccompanied Guatemalan children, told U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly that President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps to remove children from other countries “under the guise of reunification” with their parents.The administration’s actions did not comply with federal law or constitutional due process rights, Olivares said. The government also backtracked on its initial claim that the parents had requested their children’s removal.The attorney asked Kelly to bar the removal of all children in the care of the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement who are not subject to final orders, removal or voluntary departure. The group should be certified as a class, he said.“We believe the entire class is at risk (of removal),” he said.At a minimum, Olivares said, the court should bar the removal of all Guatemalan children who met those criteria. Nearly deportedA flurry of legal action over Labor Day weekend halted the removal of the 10 children, who were woken up in the middle of the night and put on planes to Guatemala before a federal judge issued an emergency restraining order.Olivares said the move appeared to be part of an administration initiative to deport children in the agency’s care.“We did not hear a denial that there are plans… to get out of the country children from other nationalities,"" he said of the U.S. Department of Justice’s position.He also told Kelly that some children were pulled out of foster homes.If a preliminary injunction is granted, Olivares asked if it could also direct ORR to place those children back in their foster homes, rather than agency-run shelters. ‘Unfortunate’ incidentCongress has carved out special legal protections for immigrant children, such as a 2008 law that requires minors be placed in immigration proceedings and able to access legal counsel.Olivares said in court Wednesday that the Trump administration broke that law over Labor Day weekend when officials tried to whisk the children out of bed for deportation to Guatemala. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, asked DOJ attorney Sarah Welch if the government has the right to wake children in the middle of the night on the weekend to remove them from the country. “I think everyone can agree it's unfortunate that the children were frightened and woken up in the middle of the night,” she said. Welch objected to class certification because there could be children in the class who want to return to Guatemala. But she acknowledged that the government had no record in the case of a child wishing to return. She added that in general, non-U.S. citizens facing removal could not be considered irreparably harmed because they could return to the U.S. Kelly said he would make a decision as soon as possible. Parents were unaware, court records showAfter immigration attorneys asked the court for emergency relief in the early morning hours of Aug. 31, a judge who heard the emergency request blocked the government from deporting the roughly 2,000 Guatemalan children in ORR’s care.DOJ attorneys initially argued that the parents of the children being removed had requested their children be returned to Guatemala. However, in court documents, the children said their parents were unaware. A declaration from one parent, referred to as B.M.R.P., detailed how she was not notified by either government of her child’s removal.“I think she is in danger if she does return to Guatemala,” B.M.R.P. said. “All I ask is that you help my daughter stay safe – help her stay safe by not returning her to Guatemala.”Kelly pressed Welch on those declarations and information from Guatemala's government that the parents of the children were not notified they would be returned to the country. Welch said that the Trump administration would withdraw its claim that the parents of the Guatemalan children had requested the return of their children.However, she said the Trump administration’s position is that a parent’s request is not required for a child to be deported. ‘I feel traumatized’Court filings also detailed the children’s experience. They said after being woken in the middle of the night, they were rushed to buses where they waited for hours without food. One 17-year-old, referred to as H.D.C.R., said the stress of being removed and potentially returned to Guatemala caused them to faint and be hospitalized for three days. “I suffered so much that I will never forget the bad time I had that weekend,” H.D.C.R. said, adding that they wish to remain in the U.S. to fight their immigration case.Many of the children also expressed their fear of returning. A 16-year-old girl, A.J.D.E., said her sister was murdered in Guatemala and she feared the same would happen to her. She said she felt relieved when she learned she was not going to be deported to Guatemala because of Sooknanan’s order.“The impact is real. I feel totally traumatized. I don’t even know how to explain it,” A.J.D.E. said.",,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A fight between New Jersey’s comptroller and a group of public joint insurance funds escalated late Tuesday when a group of the funds demanded the watchdog apologize for his recent “slanderous” investigation of the industry and accused his office of attempting to obtain confidential documents.
Their complaint echoes one made by insurance brokerage Conner Strong & Buckelew and a related entity operating under the name PERMA that alleges attorneys with acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh’s office improperly attempted to secure documents the firms said are protected by attorney-client privilege. Conner Strong, which has ties to South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, wants Gov. Phil Murphy to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Office of the State Comptroller.
“Pursuant to OSC’s current policy, memorialized in both written correspondence and in recorded statements, OSC officials have repeatedly insisted that they are entitled to review attorney-client privileged materials involving the subjects of OSC inquiries, without providing any credible legal basis justifying OSC’s access to such sacrosanct information,” Deborah Gramiccioni, counsel to Conner Strong and PERMA, said in a Tuesday letter to Murphy.
The separate letter from the chairs of six health insurance funds to Murphy, legislative leaders, and regulators called for the comptroller to apologize and retract his report. They also called for a state investigation into the office and legislation to “rein in this out-of-control agency and end these abuses of power.”
Walsh’s investigations have raised the ire of multiple public and private entities, with some of them suing in state and federal courts to prevent his office from obtaining documents or releasing reports to the public.
A spokesperson for the comptroller’s office defended its most recent investigation and its officers’ conduct, saying enabling legislation provides it access to even confidential records.
“The Legislature granted OSC broad access to public documents, including confidential ones, to ensure transparency and protect taxpayer funds,” said Pam Kruger, the spokesperson. “This specifically includes reviewing attorney-client communications for public entities, among a host of otherwise confidential materials.”
In a report released Tuesday, Walsh’s office claimed it found a bevy of contracting and ethics violations related to joint insurance funds, which allow local governmental units to pool their workers to dilute risk and secure health benefits at lower prices than they could achieve on their own.
The report alleges that Conner Strong and PERMA, which holds contracts to administrate the three funds examined by the comptroller’s review, for years failed to tell regulators and joint insurance funds they are legally and practically a single business, drafted solicitations meant to exclude other vendors, and oversaw procurements they bid on.
It’s not clear what documents the comptroller’s office is alleged to have tried to obtain. According to Kruger, the insurance funds did not provide any privileged information, nor did the office compel such productions.
“This is an attempt to distract. Every fact in OSC’s report is supported by documents or recorded interviews with (health insurance fund) trustees and vendors,” she said.
The Conner Strong and PERMA letter recounts portions of emailed exchanges and interview transcripts between officials in the comptroller’s office and those at PERMA and the health insurance funds.
“As part of OSC’s procurement reviews, we may ask for documents that are otherwise confidential and/or subject to privileges, so long as the requested documents represent government records. To the extent that any responsive documents may be confidential and/or subject to a privilege, you must still provide them responsive to OSC’s request,” comptroller attorney Alysia Walsh said in a Dec. 14 email, according to the letter.
Conner Strong is one of the nation’s largest insurance firms and was founded by Norcross, who took a leave of absence from the brokerage last year after he was indicted on unrelated racketeering charges that were later dismissed by a Superior Court judge. A Norcross spokesman said this week he has not returned to the firm.
The brokerage is contracted as program manager for the funds reviewed by the comptroller. In that role, Conner Strong provides professional and other services to the funds.
Language in the comptroller’s enabling statute gives the office broad access to public documents, including those typically excluded from disclosure under the state’s Open Public Records Act so long as they are related to an audit, performance review, or contract review the office is conducting.
Documents subject to the attorney-client privilege are listed as exempt from OPRA. That could make them subject to disclosure to the comptroller if the documents were government records related to one of the office’s investigations.
Some records created by private entities holding public contracts are considered government records disclosable under OPRA, subject to relevant exemptions, said CJ Griffin, an attorney specializing in public record matters.
“If they are created for the public agency, they should be subject to OPRA unless an exemption applies. But the entire contractor itself isn’t subject to OPRA,” she said.
For example, briefs a private municipal lawyer drafts for their township would be disclosable under OPRA, while the private law firm’s own payroll records would not be subject to disclosure, said Griffin, who has represented the New Jersey Monitor in numerous legal matters.
But statute is not the only thing that governs the disclosure of documents and information shielded by attorney-client privilege. The judiciary’s Rules of Professional Conduct also set limits on such disclosures.
Court rules generally bar attorneys from revealing information related to their representation of a client, though they include exceptions that require disclosure to prevent the commission of certain crimes.
Other provisions in court rules allow, but do not require, attorneys to breach privilege to defray the impact of a client’s illegal activity that was furthered by attorney services, mount a defense in a conflict with a client or to charges stemming from a client’s behavior, prevent a client from harming themselves, or comply with other law.
“OSC’s position does seem like a broad reading of its authority. Attorney-client privilege is pretty sacrosanct,” said Griffin.
It’s not clear whether the comptroller’s ability to breach attorney-client privilege has ever been tested in court.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) and Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) declined to comment through spokespeople. Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones did not comment on Conner Strong’s demand for a special counsel but said the governor’s office “stands ready to work with the Legislature to reform industry practices for local government and school board health insurance funds to promote fair competition and reduce conflicts of interest.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-10 22:08:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Insurance department approves double-digit rate hikes for 2026 health plans,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/10/rate-hikes-ct-health-plans/,"The rate hikes come amid a flood of federal health policy changes, including new cuts to Medicaid and expiring federal subsidies.","Officials with the Connecticut Insurance Department announced Wednesday they have signed off on an average rate hike of 16.8% for 2026 state-regulated individual health plans.
They also approved an average increase of 11% on small group policies.
The rate hikes come amid a flood of federal health policy changes, new cuts to Medicaid, tighter restrictions on care at community health centers and expiring federal subsidies.
The plans collectively cover about 224,000 residents (158,000 in individual policies and 66,000 in small group).
“All of us – regulators, consumers, and industry – have faced unprecedented uncertainty this year due to the federal government’s pending changes to health care coverage,” Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais said in a statement.
Insurers originally requested an average rate increase of 17.8% on individual health plans. Insurance department officials said that number recently rose to 23% after factoring in the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, which will run out at the end of the year.
Insurers had also asked for an average hike of 13.1% on small group plans.
“We have to figure out a way to address this, because these double-digit increases every year are not sustainable for families,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the legislature’s Insurance Committee, said Wednesday. “With housing, the cost of living, wages not keeping up, the impact of these tariffs – which is going to make everything more expensive – and now you add this, it’s going to be unsustainable.”
“These double-digit increases reflect a badly broken system that we cannot afford to ignore,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “The insurers, the hospitals, the pharmacy benefit managers have zero incentive right now to negotiate lower costs for Connecticut families. Too many families are drowning in these ballooning premiums, deductibles, coinsurances and copays.”
Three insurers sell plans through the state’s exchange, known as Access Health CT: Anthem Health Plans, ConnectiCare Insurance Company and CTCare Benefits Inc.
Anthem asked for an average rate hike of 14.2% for individual policies (later adjusted to 18.6% to reflect expiring subsidies) that cover 83,790 people. It was granted an average increase of 13.6% (with rate hikes ranging from 6.1% to 22.5%, depending on the plan).
ConnectiCare sought an average increase of 26.1% (later adjusted to 34.5%) for individual policies that cover 3,685 residents. The insurance department signed off on a 20.3% average hike.
And CTCare Benefits requested an average increase of 21.7 % (later adjusted to 28.5%) for individual plans that cover 70,160 people. A 20.6% average hike was approved.
Anthem also sought a 13.2% average hike for its small group plans that include 48,666 residents. It was granted an average increase of 11.2%.
“I would thank the insurance department for reducing the rates from what was initially requested, but I think they’re still too high,” said Karen Siegel, deputy director for Health Equity Solutions. “These increases are going to be difficult to impossible for families to accommodate, and people will lose coverage. Given all the changes coming to the [insurance] marketplaces in the next few years, rates are going to continue to go up, and the state has an obligation to contain costs.”
Insurers have cited rising health care costs, including the price of prescription drugs and greater demand for medical services, as reasons they sought rate increases.
Stephanie DuBois, a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut, said the company’s request this year was due to more policyholders needing higher cost services, including emergency department visits.
“Our submitted ACA rates are based on the health care services we expect members to access next year, along with the anticipated costs associated with that care,” she said. “Specifically, there has been an increase in ACA members utilizing higher-cost services, including emergency room care and behavioral health services, as well as some prescription drugs and specialty pharmacy. These rates also reflect our ability to deliver on behalf of consumers in Connecticut given the changes at the federal level.”
Insurers had bigger rate hike proposals this year than in 2024. Last year, insurance companies asked for an average rate hike of 8.3% on individual plans and 11.9% on small group. The state approved an average increase of 5.9% on individual policies and 7.8% on small group.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ahct-desk.jpg,,,2025-09-10 18:56:43.324959

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nikki Gronli was a bureaucrat, but in a political atmosphere where that label can be an insult, she wants to benefit from it.
“There’s bureaucracy that gets in the way at times, but that bureaucracy is often put in place by Congress,” Gronli said in a speech officially announcing her campaign for Congress on Wednesday in downtown Sioux Falls. “What if someone who understands the roadblocks goes to D.C. to eliminate the bureaucracy?”
The Democratic former Biden administration U.S. Department of Agriculture appointee said that experience — helping rural communities address infrastructure, public safety, housing and broadband needs — prepared her with skills and knowledge to “cut the red tape” if she’s elected next year to South Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat.
That includes adjusting federal program requirements and processes to streamline projects or ensure a safety net for small communities relying on federal programs, Gronli told South Dakota Searchlight after the announcement, citing her history with the USDA.

She also worked with current congressional delegates in her role as well as state leaders, nonprofits, private businesses and other federal agencies to find solutions during her tenure as state director of USDA Rural Development for three years. Before that, she worked in marketing and advertising.
“Too often I think people don’t ask, ‘Can we do this? Can we change this? Can we find some people in Congress who are willing to work on this?’” Gronli said. “I would like to go there and do that.”
Gronli, who lives in rural Dell Rapids, promised the crowd that she’ll continue to host public town halls throughout the state, which she began leading this spring.
One of the Aurora native’s biggest issues to address, if elected, will be representing South Dakota farmers, she said. She blamed the Trump administration tariffs and trade policies for “damages already taking effect” on farmers because of stalled trade markets and low commodity prices. 
“It’ll take around 60 new countries and deals to replace the Chinese soybean market that disappeared overnight and may never be the same again,” Gronli said.

China is boycotting U.S. soybean purchases this fall in response to President Trump’s tariffs. Farmers may get help from the federal government, Gronli said, but it could be too late for some.
Congress needs to “take back its responsibility” regarding tariff policy, she said, while working with the executive branch to compromise, rather than “give over their power” to the current administration. 
“As I’ve traveled the state, never once have I been told by a farmer or a rancher that all they want is a bailout,” she said. “They want markets. They want a system that leaves some money in their pocket at the end of the season for all of their hard work, and that is not too much to ask.”
Trade policies have an impact in South Dakota beyond the agricultural economy, Gronli added, including tourism and small businesses.
“This is the place where I can say that trickle-down economics actually does work,” Gronli told the crowd. “If our top industries in South Dakota are financially damaged, that trickles down to Main Street. That impacts our businesses, it impacts our workers and it impacts our families. I cannot sit back and watch Washington fail South Dakota.”
Jackley calls for improved legal immigration policy while launching his campaign for Congress

Gronli is the second Democrat to announce her candidacy for Congress. Bill Mawhiney, of Sioux Falls, announced his candidacy last month. Scott Schlagel of Dell Rapids filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission as well, setting the stage for the state’s first Democratic U.S. House primary since 2012. 
State Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson introduced Gronli at the event, highlighting her dedication to the Democratic Party and her work to connect South Dakotans with federal decision makers during her time with the USDA.
Larson told South Dakota Searchlight that she supports Mawhiney and Gronli and is excited about the prospect of a Democratic primary.
Among Republicans, Gronli said, the primary race will be a “fight.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, is running for governor next year. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley is the only Republican candidate so far to formally announce his campaign for the U.S. House seat. State Sen. Casey Crabtree, R-Madison, filed a statement of candidacy to potentially join the race.
“That fight is going to be about who more closely aligns with the very policies Washington is using to harm South Dakota — policies that harm our top industries, our workers and our people,” Gronli said. “On this side of the aisle you’re going to see issues elevated and, I guarantee, good conversations about how we best solve them.”

“There is no danger. No one needs to be locked down,” Kelley said. “The school has been swept, so now the hard work begins. We have to to protect our crime scenes, and we have to put together a case.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation and that state troopers were assisting in the response.
“Students should be able to attend school safely and without fear across our state and nation,” Polis said. “We are all praying for the victims and the entire community.”
The Democratic state lawmakers who represent the Evergreen area said Wednesday that they were shocked and outraged by the shooting.
“I am horrified by the shooting at Evergreen High School, and my heart breaks for the students, educators, families and school personnel whose start to the school year has now been marked by inexplicable violence and harm,” said Rep. Tammy Story of Conifer. “I am hoping for the swift recovery of the victims, and my thoughts are with them and their families.”
“I am heartbroken by the news of the shooting at Evergreen High School and angered at another senseless act of gun violence in our state,” said Sen. Lisa Cutter. “Schools need to be safe places, and this tragedy is yet another reminder that we must do better to protect our kids.”

A bipartisan committee advising the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is calling for the closure of the state’s three ICE detention centers. (Photos courtesy the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General)A bipartisan New Mexico committee that advises the federal Civil Rights Commission is calling for the closure of the state’s immigration detention facilities, citing concerns about detainee treatment and the private companies running them.
The 11-person New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released  findings and recommendations Monday stemming from an inquiry that began in October 2024. The board looked into civil rights at the state’s three immigration detention facilities in Otero, Cibola and Torrance counties. The committee’s chair and vice-chair dissented from the majority’s opinion. 
After the months-long review, which included several hours of testimony from immigration advocates, lawyers and other experts, the committee called for the facilities’ closure and for more oversight of  the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and its contractors.

Apart from the Torrance County manager, the committee did not hear from detention center wardens, county officials, private prison operators or federal officials. Those people all were unable or declined to participate, despite the committee going to “great lengths to solicit participation” from diverse perspectives, according to the committee’s 27-page report. 
In total, the state’s three detention centers house approximately 1,500 ICE detainees, a number that has steadily increased amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. The committee largely cited testimony from January, before Trump’s inauguration, and alleged abuses from before his second term began. 
Neither the committee’s advice to the Civil Rights Commission nor the Civil Rights Commission recommendations to federal or local authorities are binding. However, the committee recommendations echo recent calls from some Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who have called on the Legislature to ban ICE detention in the state. 
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced last week that banning the facilities will not be on the agenda of an Oct. 1 special session, but that she’d put the measure on the legislative agenda early next year and would push for the strongest possible legislation to ban ICE detention centers here. 
NM Republicans — and one Democrat — tour Otero ICE Detention Center 

Proponents of the bans say the state should neither enable nor profit off the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort; opponents note the economic benefits of the jails and say New Mexico offers relatively humane facilities as compared to other states or countries. 
The committee on July 28 voted 7-2 to accept a series of findings and recommendations regarding the facilities. Those findings note that detained immigrants in New Mexico have “limited access to legal representation and rights education,” and are being housed in unsafe facilities. Regarding the latter point, the report cites repeated issues with food services and cleanliness at the facility in Torrance, as well as a 2022 surprise Inspector General report from the facility calling for its immediate closure.
“In addition to concerns about the overall sanitation of the facilities, there were even more worrying issues raised about safety in these facilities. These issues include people going without medical attention, drug trafficking by facility staff, and being assaulted by other inmates and guards,” the committee report states. 
The committee also found that those problems were rooted in the contracting process between ICE, counties and private facility operators. 
Federal inspectors demand ICE relocate migrants detained in Torrance County

“This contracting system can create some circularity and confusion when it comes to oversight and accountability and leaves each stakeholder only partially accountable for addressing issues,” the report states. 
As for recommendations, the committee said that the Commission on Civil Rights should push the federal Homeland Security Department, which oversees ICE, to immediately begin closing the three facilities; stop using county-level passthrough contracts with private prison operators in New Mexico; expand community-based alternatives to detention; and create an independent oversight entity. 
Committee Chair Chris Saucedo and Douglas Turner, the vice-chair, both of Albuquerque, disagreed with their colleagues’ recommendations to close the facilities or terminate county-level passthrough contracts. 
“We believe that neither of these recommendations address the issues related to the creation and expansion of alternative detention options, enhancing oversight and transparency of detention operations and standards, or the creation of platforms to release prompt and accessible information to the public,” they wrote. 
Saucedo did not respond to Source’s request for comment. Turner declined to comment. 
New Mexico Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) is also on the committee. She did not respond to Source’s request for comment.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Mayor LaToya Cantrell, whose extensive, publicly funded travel is at the heart of a federal corruption case against her, will be barred from leaving the country pending trial, a judge ruled Wednesday during Cantrell’s first court appearance since she was indicted last month.
Cantrell entered a not guilty plea to 11 criminal counts — including conspiracy, wire fraud and obstruction of justice — during the arraignment hearing before Magistrate Judge Karen Wells Roby, who set the terms for Cantrell’s release pending trial.
While Roby released Cantrell without bail, she will have to surrender her passport. The mayor’s domestic travel, meanwhile, will be limited to the 13 parishes under the jurisdiction of the New Orleans federal court, unless she gets clearance from the court.
The charges, first announced Aug. 15, stemmed from Cantrell’s alleged years-long affair with New Orleans Police Department officer Jeffrey Vappie, who served on her four-person security detail.
Federal prosecutors allege that Cantrell illegally used her position to spend personal time with Vappie while he was on the clock – often earning overtime pay. The indictment also details how Cantrell allegedly arranged for regular out-of-state trips with Vappie, spending over $70,000 in taxpayer dollars on his travel costs, which included not only transportation, but meals and overtime pay. In addition to charges of conspiracy and wire fraud, federal prosecutors further charge that Cantrell lied and withheld evidence from prosecutors, even after being subpoenaed.

Cantrell arrived at New Orleans federal court shortly after 1 p.m., flanked by her attorney Eddie Castaing and city Communications Director Terry Davis. She did not offer comments to members of the press waiting outside.
“Regarding today’s arraignment, the City of New Orleans will continue to stand by its policy of reserving comment,” a Wednesday afternoon statement from the Mayor’s Office. “Additionally, on the advice of counsel, the Mayor will not make any statements before or after today’s legal proceedings.”
Cantrell’s appearance in court marks the beginning of the end of her turbulent second term as mayor, a period that has been marked by unrelenting scrutiny, from a strident effort to recall her from office to multiple clashes with the New Orleans City Council, not to mention years of rumors swirling about her alleged affair with Vappie.
Now, Cantrell, who came into office on a victorious note as the city’s first female mayor, will exit with a different moniker: New Orleans’ first mayor to be indicted while still in office.
Castaing did not respond to a request for comment.
“Residents that paid any attention to this are not surprised that she got indicted,” Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor and current president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, told Verite News, noting that Vappie was first indicted last year for charges of wire fraud due to overtime he logged while allegedly spending personal time with Cantrell.
“And I think most people are sophisticated enough to realize that neither one of them were indicted for having a personal relationship; They were indicted for using public funds to finance and pay for their personal relationship,” he added.
Goyeneche also said there was another reason residents might not be surprised: This isn’t the first time that Cantrell has gotten in trouble for misusing city funds.
“What we’re seeing her do as mayor she did to a lesser extent as a member of the city council,” Goyeneche said.
In October 2017, during Cantrell’s first successful bid for mayor, records revealed that Cantrell had charged several thousand dollars of personal expenses, including travel and meals, to her City Council credit card. She later reimbursed the city for the expenses.
“The only difference between being a councilmember and the mayor is you get a lot more power and you get access to a lot more money,” Goyeneche said.
In a similar scandal in 2018, Mayor Megan Barry of Nashville admitted to a personal relationship with her head of security, which also involved improper use of city funds to pay for travel and overtime pay. Barry later resigned from office and pleaded guilty to charges of theft. Under her plea agreement, she was sentenced to three years of probation and required to reimburse the city for the misspent funds.
‘New Orleans … in a negative light’
The indictment of Cantrell has brought additional national attention to New Orleans – a Democratic stronghold in a Republican-dominated state. The city has frequently been at the center of conservative maelstroms, from how the city has handled encampments to the implementation of a citywide ID program. Most recently, President Donald Trump suggested last week that he might deploy the National Guard to the city to address crime, despite the fact that violent crime has been on a rapid decline in the city over the last few years.
Cantrell, as the leader of the blue city, is arguably one of the most prominent Democrats in Louisiana. Perhaps because of this, local and state Democratic Party leaders have taken a cautious approach in talking about her indictment.
“So, it’s always a concern to me when New Orleans is portrayed in a negative light,” Leslie Bouie, chair of the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive Committee, told Verite News.  “However, I do feel that the mayor deserves a day in court. She hasn’t been convicted of anything yet. So, for me, it’s unfortunate that it happened. I’m concerned that it did happen. But I think we have to wait and see how it plays out in the courts.”
Dadrius Lanus, the new executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party, declined to comment on the indictment – saying he wanted to watch it play out – but said that he was confident that the city would soon be led by a strong Democratic leader after the fall municipal elections.
“There are some tremendous candidates right now who have represented the Democratic Party well, and we are just very excited about who could possibly win,” Lanus said. “The city of New Orleans is one of the most vibrant and creative cities across our country, and it serves as a platform not only for our state, but also for the Democratic Party.”
When the indictment was announced last month, the Democratic front-runners in the mayoral race – Councilmembers Helena Moreno and Oliver Thomas, as well as State Senator Royce Duplessis – largely refrained from attacking Cantrell and instead emphasizing the need for a fair trial.
“The mayor is entitled to a presumption of innocence and a vigorous defense,” Moreno said in a statement at the time.
“The announcement today reminds us of the need to let the justice system work in a fair, timely fashion and without regard to politics or preference,” Thomas said.

Route 46, about 3 miles east of Enderlin, North Dakota. (Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota is still waiting on a response to its request for federal disaster relief to help communities damaged by June tornadoes. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong requested federal disaster relief on July 21 for the June 20-21 storms.
Most federal disaster requests are resolved within 30 days, but some can be approved within two weeks, Darin Hanson, North Dakota’s emergency management director, said during a meeting Wednesday.
“We’re well beyond that 30 days now, obviously,” Hanson told members of the North Dakota Emergency Commission. “I do expect to see some sort of an answer here not too much farther after Oct. 1 at the worst case scenario.”
The Emergency Commission on Wednesday gave the Department of Emergency Services the authority to spend about $16 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and about $2 million in state funds – contingent on the presidential disaster request being approved.
Hanson said the emergency funds will be issued to local subdivisions to cover costs such as road damages and debris cleanup operations. The June storms included 20 confirmed tornados, baseball-size hail and straight-line winds over 100 mph. Nineteen North Dakota counties are part of the federal disaster relief request.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

“One of the other large pieces is the electrical co-ops,” he said. “They got a lot of damage from this storm.”
The delay in federal approval comes as other states have seen disaster requests denied by FEMA during President Donald Trump’s second term. In May, Stateline reported that denials included relief requests for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington. FEMA also denied a request that would have extended relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.
Amrstrong last week also requested federal disaster aid for August storms. 
In a joint letter to Trump from North Dakota Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and North Dakota U.S. House Rep. Julie Fedorchak, the lawmakers said they support Armstrong’s request for federal disaster relief from the storms in June, as well as more recent storms in August.
They added the size and scope of the storm damage across the state would “entirely deplete” state and local emergency funds and would leave nothing available for future disasters.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A Roseland resident has filed a lawsuit against nearby Smitty’s Supply Inc. following the Aug. 22 explosion and subsequent fire at the petroleum products facility that took more than two weeks to extinguish. 
Ronnie Polezcek filed the case Tuesday in state court in Tangipahoa Parish. It alleges Smitty’s Supply failed to properly maintain its facility and follow state environmental and safety regulations. As a result, the explosion caused widespread property damage, livestock deaths and the disbursement of toxic chemicals that contaminated nearby homes and businesses, the complaint alleges.
Polezcek, who lives about 3 miles from the facility, said he had to evacuate and relocate livestock after thick black smoke, soot and oily substances blanketed his property, according to a statement from his attorneys with the San Diego-based Singleton Schreiber law firm.
The explosion, followed by a summer afternoon rainstorm, spread oily residue over neighboring properties and a nearby elementary school where students evacuated mid-day on a Friday and returned four days later. 
Firefighting crews battled flare-ups at the Smitty’s Supply site for over two weeks, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally reporting Tuesday that the fire was 100% extinguished. Crews remain at the facility to watch for signs of rekindling, according to a statement from Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller.
Polezcek alleges his home, pond, pasture and vehicles were coated with toxic residue, forcing him to burn contaminated hay and rendering his land unsafe for grazing or water use. One of his cows gave birth to a stillborn calf shortly after the explosion, according to his lawsuit.
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.
Polezcek’s complaint said the company stored large amounts of petrochemical products at the site, including antifreeze, motor oils, lubricants, greases, hydraulic fluids and detergents. The combustion of these products released hazardous volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, dioxins and fine particulate matter. Some of the substances have been linked to cancer and long-term environmental harm, according to the lawsuit.
Polezcek’s lawsuit also cites the history of Smitty’s Supply with environmental regulators, including its federal Clean Water Act violations. The business has been assessed $161,522 in EPA penalties since 2022. 
The agency has categorized the facility’s status with regards to following federal pollution regulations as “Significant Noncompliance” for more than four years.
“Smitty’s knew the risks of its operations yet repeatedly failed to comply with the most basic safety and environmental standards,” said LaCrisha McAllister, Polezcek’s lawyer. “This explosion was not an accident, it was the foreseeable result of years of negligence, and the surrounding community is now left to deal with the fallout.”
The lawsuit, which is separate from litigation initiated by the Louisiana Environmental Action Network last week, does not list a specific dollar amount Polezcek is seeking, but it said he hopes to recover property damages, livestock relocation expenses, lost income, cleanup costs, environmental monitoring and other losses associated with the incident.

Chuck Grassley appeared on ""Iowa Press"" on Sept. 15, 2023. (Screenshot via Iowa PBS)U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Wednesday he believes U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is qualified to take the U.S. Senate seat following Sen. Joni Ernst’s exit from the race.
In a news conference Wednesday, the longtime Iowa Republican senator said he has enjoyed working with Ernst and is “disappointed” she is retiring. Last week, Ernst announced she will not seek reelection in 2026, which was shortly followed by Hinson, who has represented Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District since the 2020 election, announcing her campaign for the seat.
Hinson quickly gained the endorsements and support of many major Republican officials in Washington, D.C., including President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott. Several Iowa Republicans, such as U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and state House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann, have also backed her campaign.
Though Hinson has a clear lead in gaining institutional support, there are other Republicans competing to become the GOP nominee in the 2026 U.S. Senate race. Former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian state legislative candidate, are also campaigning for the position. Carlin had also challenged Grassley in the 2022 U.S. Senate primary.
While Grassley said he believes “Ashley’s fully qualified to succeed (Ernst),” he stopped short of giving an endorsement, saying “I’ll leave it at that at this point.”
Ernst’s retirement and Hinson’s move to the U.S. Senate race have added to the number of open races in Iowa for 2026. In addition to having no incumbents in the U.S. Senate and 2nd Congressional District races, the governor’s seat will be open as Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek another term in 2026. Iowa’s 4th Congressional District seat will also be open as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra has an “exploratory” committee pursuing a gubernatorial bid.
The two open congressional seats are in districts considered less likely to be competitive. Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Districts, represented by Republican U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn respectively, are considered by political forecasters to likely be the most competitive. Grassley said he believes Iowa Republicans will win in 2026, but acknowledged there were “tough races” ahead.
“We have these tough races at the top, and then Joni’s race, and then we already have two competitive races, normally, in southern Iowa (for) two districts,” Grassley said. “I don’t think Ashley’s will be competitive, but if it is, we’ll have to work through it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-6.24.37-PM-1024x615.png,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

(Photo courtesy of Talis Abolins)A Spokane jury has ordered Washington state to pay $42 million to a woman the state failed to protect from years of childhood sexual abuse.
The striking payout in Jessica Hilton’s case adds to the state’s skyrocketing financial liability for a range of misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases.
Washington’s payouts jumped from $72 million in fiscal year 2018 to about $500 million in the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, according to state data. Since the beginning of July, the state has already paid out nearly $89 million, not including the $42 million verdict.
A series of court rulings over the past few years opened up the state to further liability. Unlike many other states, Washington has no cap on the damages that can be paid out.
The state’s legal defense costs have similarly risen, to tens of millions of dollars per year.
The alleged misconduct the state is paying for often goes back decades and child welfare cases have driven much of the recent rise in claims. 
Hilton’s lawsuit deals with negligence primarily in the 1990s. 
Despite the 1990 conviction of Hilton’s stepfather for raping her sister, the state’s Department of Corrections and Child Protective Services allowed him back into Hilton’s life, according to court filings.
Both agencies declined to comment, other than to say they were “reviewing the jury’s decision and evaluating our legal options.” The state can appeal the lower court verdict.
Hilton’s lawyers said she was prepared to accept a settlement before trial of less than 10% of the eventual verdict, but the state only offered less than $1.5 million.
“Who is doing the risk adjustment for the state of Washington?” asked one of her attorneys, Talis Abolins, who previously worked for the state attorney general’s office for 14 years. 
Abolins expects the state to appeal.
The case
The stepfather, Raymond Mashtare, was ordered to serve more than four years in prison, but allowed to remain out of custody on a suspended sentence with a number of conditions, including state supervision, sex offender treatment and staying away from children “without a responsible adult present,” according to court documents. 
Hilton’s mother, who suffered from severe alcohol use disorder, was assigned as Mashtare’s chaperone. She would sometimes be so hungover, she’d have Mashtare watch her daughters, according to Hilton. Child Protective Services, now known as the Department of Children, Youth and Families, was reportedly aware he could be living with the victim of his crime.
Despite Mashtare’s history of sexual abuse of children, the Department of Corrections allowed him to continue spending time with his stepdaughters. The agency also failed to share information with the courts that would have forced him into prison, according to Hilton’s lawyers. The state countered that Mashtare didn’t violate the conditions of his supervision, and so there was “no basis to have Mashtare go before the court.”
Over the next decade, the state repeatedly failed to step in to protect Hilton from the sexual abuse of Mashtare and others, Hilton alleged.
“If it were not for the fact that the following events are plainly seen from available government records, it would be difficult to believe the level of recklessness by these defendants,” one expert contracted by the plaintiff wrote in court papers. 
In 1998, for example, Hilton’s mother told Child Protective Services that she’d seen Mashtare molesting Hilton. And Hilton disclosed abuse from two years earlier that she hadn’t shared out of fear of her mother blaming her. Still, CPS left Hilton in her mother’s home with a finding she faced “little or no risk” of abuse, documents state.
In court filings, the state argued officials did their due diligence investigating each referral related to Hilton. The state’s attorneys wrote that CPS investigations “were so extensive that they actually exceeded” the standard required by law.
In the 1998 example, state investigators reportedly learned Mashtare was no longer living in the mother’s home with Hilton. Prosecutors never charged Mashtare for the alleged abuse of Hilton.
The verdict
After a nearly monthlong trial in Spokane County Superior Court, a jury at the end of August awarded the $42 million verdict, with 70% of the negligence attributed to Child Protective Services (now the Department of Children, Youth and Families) and 30% to the Department of Corrections. A judge made the verdict official on Friday. Attorney fees will be decided separately.
Hilton was represented by Abolins, of mctlaw, and Eric Fong, of Fong Law.
Fong wasn’t surprised by the magnitude of the verdict, saying this is what happens “when people hear the facts and understand the profound suffering that our community and humans go through because of governmental ineptitude.”

“When you have a system that’s destroying lives, there needs to be accountability,” Fong said.
In a statement, Hilton spoke to her fellow victims of childhood abuse. 
“We must never give up fighting for our rights and freedoms, against injustices,” she said. “Not just for ourselves, but for all of us. I am honored to have the opportunity to continue healing, and to give back with the chance to lift up others. This is a future I could only dream of.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-12.17.05-PM.png,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

 “Ben & Jerry’s has become successful precisely because people know it stands for something deeper than ice cream,” Cohen and Greenfield wrote in Tuesday’s letter.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield launched a campaign Tuesday to “free” the ice cream company they founded from its current owner Unilever, claiming the larger corporation has stifled the Vermont-based outfit’s political messaging and actions.
The campaign includes two open letters authored by the Ben & Jerry’s founders, which address their concerns to the current owners and prospective investors. The move comes after years of conflict in and out of court between Ben & Jerry’s and the London-based Unilever, and seeks to mobilize public support to pressure the larger company to allow its subsidiary to regain independence. 
The letter to current board members is addressed to the Magnum Ice Cream Company, an emerging spin-off entity which will own a number of brands including Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever announced last year. In the statement, the founders argued that since Unilever purchased Ben & Jerry’s in 2000, “the commitments made to us, our employees, and our customers (have been) eroded.”

In particular, the founders wrote, the company’s “freedom to pursue its social mission,” which the founders say was enshrined in the original sale, has been infringed on a number of occasions in relation to “issues such as Gaza, indigenous rights, the Trump administration, and DEI.”
Jerry Greenfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement to VTDigger on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Unilever said, “Ben & Jerry’s is a proud part of The Magnum Ice Cream Company and is not for sale.” The spokesperson added that Unilever remains “committed to Ben & Jerry’s unique three-part mission — product, economic and social — and look(s) forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved business.” 
Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever last year for allegedly trying to block the smaller company’s statements on Gaza, after turmoil over the company’s presence in Israel and the West Bank. Earlier this year, Ben & Jerry’s claimed in court that its parent company ousted longtime CEO David Stever over his support for progressive activism, sparking protests from employees.
“That is not the Ben & Jerry’s that we founded,” Cohen and Greenfield wrote in Tuesday’s open letter. “Ben & Jerry’s has become successful precisely because people know it stands for something deeper than ice cream.” 
The pair also addressed prospective investors, urging them to reconsider their involvement with Magnum and advising them that the founders, as well as many employees and customers, no longer support the direction of the company under current management.
“We intend to campaign for an independent Ben and Jerry’s, owned by values-aligned investors,” Cohen and Greenfield said.

(Photo courtesy of Jefferson County Sheriff's Office)Three students were hospitalized in critical condition after a shooting at Evergreen High School, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday. One of the hospitalized students is the suspected shooter.
The shooting was reported shortly after noon and is believed to have taken place on school grounds but not inside the building, Jacki Kelley, a sheriff’s office spokesperson, said in a press conference. It was not immediately clear how the shooting suspect was injured, but Kelley said she did not “believe law enforcement fired any rounds today.”
“There is no danger. No one needs to be locked down,” Kelley said. “The school has been swept, so now the hard work begins. We have to to protect our crime scenes, and we have to put together a case.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation and that state troopers were assisting in the response.
“Students should be able to attend school safely and without fear across our state and nation,” Polis said. “We are all praying for the victims and the entire community.”
The Democratic state lawmakers who represent the Evergreen area said Wednesday that they were shocked and outraged by the shooting.
“I am horrified by the shooting at Evergreen High School, and my heart breaks for the students, educators, families and school personnel whose start to the school year has now been marked by inexplicable violence and harm,” said Rep. Tammy Story of Conifer. “I am hoping for the swift recovery of the victims, and my thoughts are with them and their families.”
“I am heartbroken by the news of the shooting at Evergreen High School and angered at another senseless act of gun violence in our state,” said Sen. Lisa Cutter. “Schools need to be safe places, and this tragedy is yet another reminder that we must do better to protect our kids.”

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County can continue using the bathroom of his choice while a lawsuit continues, the nation’s highest court said Wednesday.
The order applies to only one student. The ninth grader, identified in court filings as John Doe, is suing the state over a budget clause requiring transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their biological sex at birth.

25A234 Order 
Last month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said that student could use the school bathroom of his choice while the case proceeded, overturning a lower court’s decision. Attorney General Alan Wilson’s office asked the Supreme Court to overturn that decision, arguing the appeals court got it wrong.
The nation’s high court declined to overrule last month’s ruling. That decision “is not a ruling on the merits of the legal issues presented in the litigation,” reads the Wednesday order. “Rather, it is based on the standards applicable for obtaining emergency relief from this Court.”
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed and would have granted the state’s request, according to the order.
That lawsuit is ongoing. The budget clause, first added to the state budget last year, remained in the spending plan that took effect July 1. School districts that don’t enforce it risk losing a quarter of their funding.
Although the order applied only to the one student involved in the lawsuit, it showed support for all transgender students, said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney working on the case for Public Justice.
“We are so thrilled that our client will continue to be able to use boys’ restrooms while his appeal continues, and hope today’s decision will provide hope to other trans students and their families during these difficult times,” Brodsky said in a statement.
Wilson said he was confident the state would ultimately win the lawsuit. He emphasized that the decision applied only to one student.

“What happened today was not just an attack on Charlie personally, but, really an attack on the idea that we resolve these things through reason, debate, and elections,” DeSantis said.

U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican candidate for governor, called Kirk “an American Patriot” in a social media post. “He did not deserve this heinous act. NOBODY DOES. Pray for Charlie.”
Republican candidate for governor and former House Speaker Paul Renner said, “Charlie was taken from us by a sick and deranged act of political violence,” in a social media post.
“The world stops when we hear of political violence. And it should. Prayers for Charlie Kirk right now, for our nation, and for our politics,” former U.S. Rep. and Democratic candidate for governor David Jolly said in a social media post.
Tuesday, the Phoenix reported on a survey finding that during the past three years, violence against campus speakers was viewed as increasingly more acceptable.
The 2025 College Free Speech Rankings produced by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression found that 34% of students nationwide consider it acceptable, at least in rare cases, to use violence to stop a campus speech. In 2024, that number was 32%; in 2023, it was 27%; in 2022, it was 20%. In 2020, 24% of students found violence acceptable at least in rare situations.

During a Florida Board of Governors meeting Wednesday in Sarasota, Education Commissioner Anastasio Kamoutsas prayed for Kirk.
“We want to pray God that his soul be resting right now, that his wife, you are there comforting her as well as his children during this incredibly difficult time,” Kamoutsas said and paused for a moment of silence.
Kirk toured the country appearing on university campuses offering debate with people. He appeared at Florida State University, University of South Florida, University of Central Florida, and the University of Florida in February.

“I am not in agreement with the Board’s decision on this matter,” Drummond said in a statement. “However, I respect it is their decision to make. If this is the attorney they wish to hire, then I will not interfere.”
Drummond first aired his disagreement last week after four members of the seven-seat board voted to hire Oklahoma City attorney Ryan Leonard as the board’s counsel. Leonard said last week he was “shocked and dismayed” at the criticism because until that point the Attorney General’s Office had communicated to him that Drummond was supportive of him taking on the role.
“I appreciate the Attorney General allowing me and my firm the opportunity to render this important public service for our state,” Leonard said in a statement Wednesday. “I look forward to working with the Superintendent and all of the members of the State Board of Education.”
Drummond has the authority to revoke a state board’s contract with an attorney. He said he will allow the state Board of Education to hire Leonard “for now,” but he reserves the right to cancel the contract “if circumstances justify that action.”

He revoked a lawyer’s contract with the state Board of Education once before. Last year, Drummond removed an attorney who had advised the board to block state lawmakers from attending private portions of the board’s meetings, contrary to the attorney general’s advice.
Drummond called Leonard “politically connected” but unqualified to represent a state board. 
Leonard said his firm — Leonard, Long & Cassil, PLLC — has ample experience in state government law and in representing state agencies.
State Board of Education member Mike Tinney, also an attorney, said he believed Leonard is “very qualified” for the position. State Superintendent Ryan Walters didn’t attend the board meeting last week, but he issued a statement afterward saying he was “pleased to welcome Ryan Leonard to the team.” 
Leonard previously served as special counsel for Native American affairs for Gov. Kevin Stitt, of whom Drummond is a frequent critic. Drummond is a Republican candidate running to succeed Stitt as governor.
“While I have no issues with Ryan Leonard personally, it is clear he does not have the proper experience to serve as general counsel to the most significant governing board in the State of Oklahoma,” Drummond said. “You wouldn’t hire a divorce attorney to sue your insurance company, and you wouldn’t hire a DUI lawyer to handle an adoption. Mr. Leonard does not have the right legal experience to do this job, but he certainly has the right political connections.”

The attorney for a former California man convicted of charges in a plot to kill a business partner in Vermont is asking a judge to delay his sentencing where he faces a mandatory sentence of life behind bars.
Prosecutors responded in their own filing that the hearing should go forward as scheduled.
Serhat Gumrukcu, 42, is set to be sentenced later this month in federal court in Burlington after a jury returned guilty verdicts against him in April for offenses including murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The case against Gumrukcu stems from the fatal shooting of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. According to prosecutors, Gumrukcu ordered and paid for Davis to be killed over a failed oil trading deal between the two men. 
Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, filed a motion Wednesday morning seeking to delay that sentencing for at least 60 days.

Marcus wrote that a draft presentence report prepared by federal probation officers has raised issues that she wanted to address before her client’s sentencing.
While Gumrukcu faces a mandatory life sentence, Marcus wrote in the filing, “nonetheless issues like the amount of a fine, restitution, as well as factual assertions that we dispute are relevant to sentencing and warrant a response from Serhat Gumrukcu.”
Prosecutors, in a response filed later Wednesday afternoon, wrote that a delay was not warranted. 
“This Court must sentence the defendant to life,” the filing stated. “Sentencing is therefore not complex.”
The prosecution filing also included a statement from Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow. She wrote about the impact a delay would have on her and her family.
“For seven long years we have prayed and waited for justice in the death of my husband. We are deeply grateful for the jury’s verdict earlier this year, which finally brought us a measure of justice and peace,” Melissa Davis wrote.
“Your Honor, each postponement reopens wounds that have struggled to heal. We have endured years of extensions and delays with patience and grace, but the weight has been heavy,” Melissa Davis added. “My children and I long to take the next step forward in our lives, and that step cannot fully come until this process is complete.”  
Judge Christina Reiss, who has presided over the case, had not issued a ruling by late Wednesday afternoon.
Gumrukcu led the murder-to-hire plot to kill Davis over fears that the Vermont man was going to go to authorities and accuse him of fraud in a business deal between them regarding oil trading that had been ongoing for months. 
That would, prosecutors said during the trial, possibly have hindered a larger business deal Gumrukcu had in the works with a biomedical company with millions of dollars at stake. 
Gumrukcu was a Turkish national with permanent U.S. residency status at the time of Davis’ killing. Davis, who was 49 at the time of his death, was living in Vermont with his wife and six children, with a seventh on the way.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/10/ct-credit-ratings-lamont/,"The upgrades by Moody’s and Fitch are likely campaign fodder for Gov. Ned Lamont, who is widely expected to announce a bid for a third term.","Connecticut continues to earn higher marks from Wall Street credit ratings agencies, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday, hailing the latest upgrades as further evidence that his administration has reversed the state’s once-floundering fiscal outlook.
The upgrades by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch ratings and the improved pension fund performance also are likely campaign fodder for a Democratic governor widely expected to announce a bid for a third term soon.
“Let there be no doubt that Connecticut is back,” said Lamont, who joined Treasurer Erick Russell at the Capitol to outline how the state has doubled its pension assets in the past decade. “This is the result of sound fiscal management, a growing trust in Connecticut by businesses and residents, which is reflected in our improved economic statistics, and a historic run in the stock market.”
Connecticut failed to save adequately for more than seven decades prior to 2011 for pensions promised to retired state workers and teachers. By failing to do so, it effectively forfeited billions of dollars in potential investment earnings, leaving future generations of taxpayers to cover these obligations.
This mounting debt, in turn, drove up minimum required payments the state had to make annually to these retirement programs in the 2000s and 2010s, a trend that contributed to major state tax hikes in 2009, 2011 and 2015 while still leeching resources away from education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
Connecticut’s fortunes started to shift in 2011 when then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy closed loopholes that had allowed the state to short-change its pensions for decades. Malloy also twice secured major benefit concessions from state employee unions.
And in 2017, legislators from both parties adopted controversial budget caps that have forced huge annual savings. Since 2020, the state has dedicated more than $8.5 billion in surplus to its pensions and could deposit nearly $2 billion more later this fall. Those payments, coupled with a robust stock market and improved state investment policies, leave Connecticut with roughly $63 billion in assets for its pensions for retired state employees and municipal teachers.
“If we continue the progress we have made, the state’s pension debt … will be fully funded within a generation,” the governor said. “This is the legacy we are leaving our children and grandchildren and one we should all be proud to reach.”
Moody’s elevated Connecticut’s score from Aa3 to Aa2. The “Aa” ratings bracket is Moody’s second-highest and is reserved for states and other entities whose bond offerings are “of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.”
Similarly, Fitch upgraded Connecticut from AA- to AA.  For Fitch, “AA” is its second-highest ratings tier and is reserved for bond offerings “of very low default risk.”
The immediate impact of these upgrades should be lower interest rates for a state that borrows billions of dollars annually to build and renovate local schools, replace its aging transportation infrastructure and finance numerous capital projects at public colleges and universities.
But Russell said the upgrades mean much more than that.
Cheaper borrowing costs and minimum pension contributions that aren’t surging dramatically year after year “is going to allow us to … make really critical investments in education and in child care and [build] on so much of the work that has been done under the governor and the legislature’s leadership,” Russell said.
Required pension contributions this fiscal year will gobble up $3.4 billion of the budget’s General Fund, about $250 million more than last year. But that obligation would have grown by about $980 million had Connecticut not been pouring surplus into pensions since 2020.
“That’s money we can use to invest in our future, and/or cut taxes, both of which we have done,” Lamont added.
But many of the governor’s fellow Democrats, and other critics, say that’s not a fair description of the process.
The budget caps that generate huge annual surpluses are doing much more harm to education, municipal aid, and other core programs than any benefit these services are receiving from the limited growth in mandatory pension payments, they say.
State budget surpluses, since 2017, have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year, or more than 8% of the General Fund.
Many Democratic legislators have called over the past year for Connecticut to scale back savings efforts, arguing even a modest adjustment still would allow the state to attack pension debt while also preserving core programs.
Democratic legislative leaders were forced this spring to scrap plans for a state income tax credit for middle-class families with children and dramatically scale back new investments in Medicaid rates for doctors who accept low-income patients. Connecticut hadn’t adjusted its rates in broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many patients unable to find doctors willing to treat them.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign in March attacking Lamont. Though grants to towns, on paper, have risen since he took office in 2019, CCM estimates education funding alone, once adjusted for inflation, has declined by more than $400 million.
Republican legislators have praised Connecticut’s efforts to reduce pension debt.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford said “the governor and Democrats [also] have made strides to undermine the money that has been paid into pensions.”
The GOP has criticized Lamont for allowing too many accounting gimmicks and other maneuvers to work around budget caps to accommodate frustrated Democrats.
The administration agreed in June to move $350 million outside of the traditional budget to finance a major expansion in child care service by the early 2030s.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — A wildland firefighter told Kentucky lawmakers Wednesday that firefighters the state dispatches to control wildfires are grappling with low pay and a high turnover rate that heightens the dangers of their already hazardous work. 
Zoe Treibitz, who said she worked as an emergency wildland firefighter in the Kentucky Division of Forestry’s office in Hazard, told the state legislature’s Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force that chronic understaffing among wildland firefighters is putting communities at risk. 
“This job is a calling. It’s hard, dangerous and demanding, but it’s also meaningful,” Treibitz said. “But every year, emergency firefighters are forced to leave the work they love not because they want to, but because they simply cannot afford to stay.” 
Treibitz, 24, said the Division of Forestry has full-time staff and seasonal firefighters to control wildfires, but many of the firefighters on the ground are hired on an on-call “emergency” basis. These emergency firefighters, Treibitz said, work at various times throughout the year depending on fire activity. 
Treibitz said during an active fire season, workdays for emergency wildland firefighters can stretch over 12 hours multiple days in a row. She said firefighters are often breathing in smoke, traversing cliffs and managing rapidly shifting fire lines. Treibitz said her former colleagues deal with chronic fatigue and muscle strains, and she personally dealt with weeks of painful blisters on her heels at one point. 
She said people who dismiss wildland firefighting as “unskilled labor” are wrong.
“Our jobs require us to be part meteorologist, part topographer, part biologist, constantly reading the land, the weather, the fuel, to predict how a fire will move,” Treibitz said. “These are not skills you can pick up overnight. They come through rigorous training and on-the-ground-boots experience.” 
The pay for those long days is low. An anonymous letter sent in June to the task force, written by a group claiming to represent emergency wildland firefighters, stated their current wage is $12 an hour. The letter also called on lawmakers to establish a way for emergency firefighters to accrue sick leave and paid time off and criticized a lack of training provided for firefighters. Data from the state’s online portal that displays salaries of state employees suggests emergency wildland firefighters make $12 an hour, while seasonal wildland firefighters can make more. 
Treibitz, who told the Lantern she was part of the group that wrote the letter, urged lawmakers to increase the pay to $17 an hour, comparable with other states, in next year’s legislative session when a new two-year state budget will be crafted. Treibitz said she recently left her job as an emergency wildland firefighter in part because of low pay and other concerns expressed in the June letter. She said Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, invited her to speak before the task force after the letter was sent. 
Sen. Robin Webb, R-Grayson, who has been in the legislature since 1999, said she appreciated Treibitz’ testimony and that state forestry work has historically been “grossly underfunded and sometimes the first thing to be cut in budget cycles.” 
A spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, which houses the Division of Forestry, did not immediately provide a response Wednesday afternoon to questions about the anonymous letter and Treibitz’ testimony.

Wildland firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service have also criticized low pay and arduous work schedules with some firefighters quitting because of the poor working conditions. 
Hart, the state representative and a retired lieutenant with the Lexington Fire Department, proposed lawmakers consider creating a statewide program to coordinate wildland firefighting resources similar to a statewide program coordinating search and rescue resources. He said most fire departments in the state focus training on structure fires “because that’s what they see all the time.” 
“We don’t have the ability to really hone in our skills on wildfire firefighting like we should,” Hart said. “They are a very specialized skill set, and I’m telling you from experience because I’ve been on some of these forest fires in our state.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1991_smaller-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

“I look at this as like a crisis that they're facing,” the Republican governor said Wednesday.

MONTPELIER — Gov. Phil Scott said his administration plans to present a slate of recommendations to Burlington leaders in the coming weeks to address what he called a “crisis” related to homelessness and public drug use in the state’s largest city.
Scott’s comments, during a press conference Wednesday, come several weeks after Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak charged that the governor was not doing enough to help her city, or other municipalities around Vermont, respond to persistent social and economic challenges that have garnered significant statewide attention.
At the same time, Scott and leaders from his administration argued that the city isn’t doing enough on its own to enforce existing laws, including cracking down on illegal drug use and drug dealing as well as property crimes. A man’s death last month after he was assaulted near downtown’s City Hall Park has also inflamed local safety concerns.
“I look at this as like a crisis that they’re facing, much like a flood,” Scott told reporters, speaking in response to a question about the city’s economic vitality. “And the first thing that we need to do is respond to the flooding and help people — and then, the recovery part after. So, it’ll be a two-step process.”
The Republican governor said he met with a group of Burlington business owners Tuesday and plans to meet soon with residents and academic leaders, all of which would inform his recommendations. He would not share any specific policy changes he might propose. Scott said his administration would present its plan to Mulvaney-Stanak, who’s a Progressive, as well as the Democratic-controlled Burlington City Council.

Late last month, the council overwhelmingly passed a resolution aimed at barring people from camping overnight in City Hall Park — something that is not allowed under local ordinances but has nevertheless become commonplace — and bolstering the presence of law enforcement officers in the area, among other measures. 
In the park, which is located just off the Church Street shopping hub, “acts of violence, drug trafficking, open drug use, the fencing of stolen goods, disorderly conduct, unlawful mischief, and similarly unacceptable incidents are far too commonplace,” the council resolution states.
Scott’s press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said in an email Wednesday afternoon that the governor’s plan would focus on “public safety, holding service-resistant repeat offenders accountable, and connecting those in need of treatment to services.”
City leaders have not explicitly asked Scott to make policy recommendations, the governor said. But he contended that his goal was not to impose changes on the city that it would not want.
“We’re not going to force ourselves onto the city much like we’re seeing across the country with the current administration in Washington. That’s not our role,” Scott said. “If the city would like our help, we would lay out a plan to let them know what we can provide, and what we can’t.”
Mulvaney-Stanak wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon that she was “pleased to hear” the governor and his administration were considering ways to help Burlington.
The city is developing a list of specific requests for the state government that it believes would complement efforts already underway locally to address health and safety challenges, the mayor wrote. Her office is doing its own outreach to community members as part of that process, too.
“I look forward to meeting with the Governor to discuss our respective ideas and identify areas for deeper collaboration and coordination on both immediate and longer term solutions,” the mayor wrote.

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).The 3,200 Boeing mechanics and workers who have been on strike at Missouri and Illinois locations since August will vote on a new settlement agreement on Friday. 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced Wednesday a union negotiating committee had reached a tentative agreement with Boeing Defense.
“The five-year tentative agreement includes improvements to general wage increases and restores a signing bonus,” the union said in a prepared statement.  “IAM union members will be provided with more information soon.”
Union workers walked out from their jobs at Boeing’s three facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill., on Aug. 4 after members rejected a four-year labor agreement. 
According to a union statement announcing the strike, its members “assemble and maintain advanced aircraft and weapons systems, including the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies.”
One of the union’s biggest complaints was the pay progression to get to top-scale pay is much slower than other Boeing sites and other aerospace manufacturers. The union was looking to decrease the amount of time, which is called auto progression, in the new contract, Chad Stevenson, a plant chairman for the union at the St. Louis facility, said in August. 
He said the original offer wouldn’t equally benefit the longtime workers who endured pay freezes when the company’s contracts were “lean” over the last several years.
“Our members took concessions to help this company and continued to produce the same amount and the same quality of work,” said Stevenson, who works as an assembly mechanic. “So really it was over eight years, top-scale wasn’t raised. And we’re ready for them to make a competitive, fair offer in these negotiations and take it back before membership and let them decide again.”
In reaction to the details of the new offer, Stevenson said Wednesday that he wants union members to make a “collective decision, and I hope that we have a good showing at the vote, and there’s a good representation of what our membership wants.”
Boeing posted some key points of the agreement on its website Wednesday.
“Thanks to guaranteed wage increases, increased auto progression, and new progression opportunities, our team could earn up to 45% more on average by the end of this contract,” the website states. 
It also states that employees in progression represent 78% of the team and have the potential to see “their hourly wages grow even higher than 45% by leveraging the new pay enhancements.”
Last week, Boeing announced it would be hiring permanent replacement workers for the empty position. 
“If a job has been permanently replaced, there may not be a role to return to immediately,” the website states. “If a role is not immediately available, they will be added to a recall list until a position for which they are qualified becomes available.”
However, some workers told St. Louis Public Radio that Boeing already struggled to hire skilled workers before the strike began.
IAM Union members at Boeing Defense will vote on the tentative agreement Friday morning at the St. Louis Music Park in Maryland Heights. If the contract is ratified, striking employees will be required to return to work on Monday at 11 p.m.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

Lisa Murkowski speaks on Election Day on Nov. 8, 2022 at a press conference held at her campaign headquarters in Anchorage. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Since January, I have called U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski’s office regularly to express my concerns about the GOP agenda, because I thought she was a moderate Republican open to input. I held out hope she might leave her party and stand up for all Alaskans and Americans. However, her deciding vote on H.R.-1, the “Big Ugly Bill” made me realize my calls to her office were pointless.
First and foremost, Sen. Murkowski is not a moderate Republican. She, like her Alaskan colleagues in Congress, are millionaires voting for their own interests. It seems there are no moderate Republicans left in Congress. The overtime and tip tax breaks that could help millions of everyday Americans are extremely restricted and sunset in 2028. Meanwhile, the tax breaks for millionaires are permanent.
Second, I do not believe Sen. Murkowski agonized over the vote. Murkowski has been adept at finding a nuanced political position over the years, one that allows her to appear independent while never actually derailing the GOP agenda. Murkowski had the opportunity to truly be an independent voice for all of America, like John McCain’s famous thumbs down vote against repealing Obamacare. Instead, she made a big political show, maintained her facade of the contrarian, and voted in line with Trump because she is afraid of retaliation.
Finally, there is a cognitive dissonance in her vote that cannot be explained away by a few Alaska specific add-ons. Murkowski has made comments critical of Trump’s immigration policies such as when fellow U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, D-California was forcibly removed from a press conference, tackled to the ground, and detained. Yet she voted to increase the ICE operating budget by  hundreds of million dollars. Murkowski has consistently said she “strongly supports women’s reproductive freedoms” in opposition to many of her GOP colleagues, yet her vote on this bill stripped funding from Planned Parenthood. She said she was considering leaving the GOP to become an Independent, but she voted in line with the GOP. Her actions do not support her statements. The only logical conclusion therefore is that Sen. Murkowski is lying to Alaska. If she actually believes these claims then she is lying to herself, and that is the true hallmark of a MAGA Republican.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC02606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 17:57:40.731834

“Polished videos are nice, but how ‘bout a real conversation?,” the state employees’ union president posed to Scott in a video of her own.

In an appeal to state workers, Gov. Phil Scott released a video statement this week explaining his decision to institute a three-days-per-week return to office across state government. 
“Vermonters want and need to access their government. They need to see us in their communities. They need to know where and how we work,” he said, recording from his office desk. “Most importantly, they want and need us to be good stewards of their tax dollars.”
For its part, the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has strongly opposed the move, and its president released a video of her own in response. 
“You have excluded us from the conversation. You have shut us out of your secret committee that is meeting to work on a policy that will have devastating impacts on the delivery of vital services,” Aimee Bertrand said in her video message, referencing a cross-agency group Scott had empowered to plan the logistics of the switch. She recorded from her kitchen, where she said she works remotely every day. 


The dueling videos reveal the high stakes of the new policy decision, which sent shockwaves across state government when Scott first announced his intention last month. Starting Dec. 1, state employees will be expected to work from their offices at least three days per week, a pivot for many who have grown accustomed to almost total flexibility to work from home. 
Scott and his top deputies have said the decision is driven by a need to increase collaboration and transparency both between workers and with the public. The employees’ union has criticized the policy as arbitrary and running contrary to Vermont data indicating state employees highly value remote work and believe it positively impacts productivity. 
Addressing state workers directly in a video was a rare step for Scott, who used the speech to stress that his choice was not a slight at the quality or commitment of Vermont’s workforce. He also noted that many state workers haven’t been able to work remotely at all.  
“One of the things I’m most proud of as governor is the silos we’ve broken down between agencies and departments,” he said in his video statement released Monday. “But we’ve lost some of that camaraderie and collaboration because we don’t see each other in person.”


On Tuesday, Bertrand turned up the pressure, accusing Scott of “attempting to divide state workers and pit them against each other.”
She argued employees are safer when they don’t have to drive through storms or work in “poorly secured” state buildings, and that less travel time was an environmentally conscious decision. 
“Polished videos are nice, but how ‘bout a real conversation?” Bertrand posed to Scott.  
Scott’s administration has the power to alter employee telework agreements with two weeks notice, far less than the three month timeline laid out. Still, the three-month turnaround is a daunting logistical feat and questions linger about its rollout. Sarah Clark, Vermont’s administration secretary, said Wednesday that the hybrid return-to-office plan is taking up 99% of her focus. 
Across the country, both private business and the public sector have grappled with bringing employees back to the office since Covid-19 brought a halt to some in-person work. In many states, governors’ efforts to bring back state workers, either part-time or full-time, have  been met with aggressive union opposition — and mixed results. 
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott first sought to end telework but then signed legislation bringing back the option. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the state governor’s return to work order after a state employees’ union challenged it. And in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has pushed for four days in office, his administration cut deals with employees’ unions to limit the mandate in exchange for salary concessions.

That makes it the perfect introduction for this milestone anniversary season, said New Stage Artistic Director Francine Thomas Reynolds. “I think you have to go with anything that happens, right?”

From the start, the founders’ commitment reached beyond entertainment. They wanted something different, hence the “New Stage” name. Desegregating the stage and the audience in civil rights era Mississippi brought called-in threats, Reynolds said, recalling conversations with founding Artistic Director Ivan Rider. 
“Doing things like ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ as their first show — it was very bold. … They kept going. They did it.” 
Subsequent hurdles included a financial crisis that nearly closed the theater in 2001, but New Stage powered through with an “intermission” season, skeleton staff and volunteers, and rebuilt. The COVID-19 pandemic brought another huge challenge. 
“While theaters were closing or pausing around the country, we pivoted,” said Sharon Miles, former New Stage education director, frequent performer and, later this season, a guest director. Virtual play readings, streamed shows and an online summer camp met the moment.  
“That type of resilience says so much about who we are as artists, as a theater, as a community, and I won’t ever forget that,” she said.
“I think after 60 years, a lot does go wrong, that you make right,” Reynolds said, from problem-solving design challenges to keeping the lights on (or rehearsing in the back alley when Katrina knocks them out). “That’s part of the magic of theater, and how you make it happen and how you persevere.”
A milestone season brings into focus what the theater has gotten right all along. That perseverance and its legacy have a generational impact. Starkville native Miles was a 9th grader when she saw a production of August Wilson’s “Fences” at New Stage Theatre. 
“It was the first time I had ever seen an all-Black cast. It was a turning point in my life, because I did not know you could make a career in theater before that moment.” 
Miles just completed her master of fine arts degree in acting at Northwestern University in Chicago. She returns to New Stage in February to direct the Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Primary Trust” by Eboni Booth, part of the anniversary season’s main stage lineup.
Award-winning Atlanta-based playwright Topher Payne is among many who can claim New Stage as a launchpad. 
“I’m so fortunate that that was where, as a teenager, I learned what I had a right to expect in a professional theater environment, which was so driven by people first, product second,” said Payne, who came onboard as an apprentice almost 30 years ago. 
“From (founder) Jane Reid Petty forward, it was always with the goal of creating a space where community can gather. And, that wasn’t just what we’re offering the audience. It’s what we’re offering as artists, to each other,” Payne said. “For me, as a 17-year-old artsy kid from Kosciusko, that was my safe space. … It was safe for me to be joyful. It was safe for me to be brave and bold and make mistakes, and have the support of the community. That still propels me forward and expects me to do the same for others.” 
He worked that theater know-how into a professional career that has taken him all over the world. It pulls him back to Mississippi in April, when he’ll direct his new play “The Attala County Garden Club,” a contemporary Southern comedy Payne described as “a little bit ‘Witches of Eastwick’ … a little bit ‘Get Out.’” 
“It’s a story for everybody who ever thought they wanted to fit in, and then have to deal with what happens when they do,” he said.
Veteran New Stage actor Jo Ann Robinson’s show count hovers around 58, and she’ll notch another in Payne’s play next spring. The theater’s faithful core group of Mississippi-based performers and crew who return, show after show, bring the skill and dedication artistic directors can rely on, she said. 


“They’re responsible, they show up when they’re supposed to, and they’re easy to work with. … That makes it better for everyone.
“The people behind the scenes, the crews, the designers, the people in administration, the actors that work there consistently — it’s like home to us,” Robinson said. “That does set it apart.”
That care runs deep. This week, New Stage unveils the honorary renaming of the Belhaven block bound by Carlisle, Whitworth, Fortification and Monroe streets to Bill McCarty Square. The move celebrates Bill McCarty III’s roles as passionate New Stage volunteer for more than 50 years, generous donor and, for the past 24 years without compensation, the theater’s general manager.
Jackson actor John Howell, an intern in 1993 and briefly education director, adds to his frequent onstage work in “The Play That Goes Wrong,” as the earnest actor playing the butler. Fondren Theatre Workshop, started by Howell and his wife, Diana, in 2003, partners with New Stage to present John Maxwell’s play “We Need to Talk” at the New Stage’s Warehouse Theatre in November.
Now retired from teaching, Howell highlighted the key role of training at New Stage. 
“There are so many opportunities for young people, starting with kids, starting with the camps and the classes. So many people who are onstage now started out back then, as kids,” he said, noting, too, its extraordinary opportunities for associates (formerly called interns) for professional training. “They basically create their own season in the Unframed Series, in addition to all the touring and the support they give to the main shows.
“New Stage is a really great laboratory for learning about the art of theater, for all ages, for all skill levels, and for all types of interests,” Howell said.
That’s intentional. 
“When we hire people, we spend a lot of time making sure that they have a good foundation for more work,” Reynolds added.

Miles called it “a garden of fertile ground for artists. It’s a place where local talent can grow — whether you’re acting, directing or working in design.” Fruits from her New Stage time include character and community building, and the importance of costume checks. 
One night, playing the star’s best friend in “Mahalia: A Gospel Musical,” her usually meticulous check proved not good enough. 
“I’m supposed to be driving this car and we’re supposed to take off really, really fast. … So, I speed off, I throw my head back and my wig comes off onstage! I’m completely frozen. I don’t know what to do, and Mahalia looks at me and says, ‘Didn’t put that wig on too tight, did you?’”
They laughed and so did the audience, who probably never knew it was a flub. Miles chuckled.
“I check my wigs very securely now.”
Reynolds’ own New Stage roots reach back to 1989 with a “Steel Magnolias” role, followed by day camp leadership and education director, and acting and guest directing till 1995. She came back in 2006 to restart the day camp, was kept on to plan the main stage season and hired as artistic director in 2007. 
A thread throughout the theater’s history is a focus on good scripts. 
“This is one thing I always remember about Jane,” Reynolds said of New Stage Theatre founder Petty’s constant eye on well-written scripts. “She would say that, and I always kept that in my head.”
Mississippi stories, written by Mississippians and/or dealing with the state’s culture, icons and history, are another key thread. Plays by Eudora Welty, Beth Henley and Tennessee Williams, certainly, graced the stage, and so have works by Payne, Maxwell and Randy Redd, adaptations of books by John Grisham and Jill Conner Browne, plays about or including Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Bobby Rush, productions tapping into state history with the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Fannie Lou Hamer, Freedom Riders,  the murder of Emmett Till and more.
About 70% of the actors onstage are Mississippians. 
“I think it’s real important to be within the community, and build community,” Reynolds said. “Theater has the agency to build community more than a lot of things.”
 She sees it in the summer day camps. 
“I say all the time, ‘If politicians would do day camp, everything would be better.’ People from all walks of life — private and public school, different districts, different counties — come together and have a good time and solve problems and collaborate.” 
In 2017, New Stage initiated the Mississippi Plays Series as part of its Eudora Welty New Play Series, partly because certain plays and stories told about Mississippi did not get it right, Reynolds said. 
“I thought it was real important that we pay attention to the stories that are being told about Mississippi, and try to contribute to that.”
When it comes to the “magic” of theater, the production team has conjured some gasp-worthy moments over the years. The train in “Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express” (2019-20 season, Scenic Designer Dex Edwards), complete with moving cars onstage, was a particular standout that amazed even a seasoned pro. 
Maxwell, also a former artistic director as well as longtime actor, sat behind Technical Director Richard Lawrence in the audience one night, and murmured praise the first time the train’s dining car moved to the sleeper car, Lawrence said.  
“Then it moved again in the same direction … and he leaned over and goes, ‘I know how big this theater is, where the hell is that train going?’” When the train split for the caboose to come downstage, a string of “Omigods” summed up the wonder. 
“The train was the very first time I ever got applause for a set,” Lawrence said.
Another high point was the truck in “The Grapes of Wrath,” (2013-14 season, also designed by Edwards). Packing up the house, the family stacked items on the table which then turned around to reveal the truck it had become — a washboard as radiator, pots for headlights, washtubs for wheels. Built on a small turntable on a slipstage, it was able to turn and drive across the stage. 
“That was, to me, pretty ding-dang cool,” Lawrence said.
Onstage rain in several productions and a moment in “The Sound of Music,” when the whole villa moved downstage (to applause from wowed viewers) were other high points.
“One of the things New Stage does well, and it’s partly because of you,” Reynolds said to Lawrence, “is that we are able to look good on a small budget.”
Lawrence nodded. “That’s the miracle, every time.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Senate Republicans met behind closed doors on Wednesday at the Indiana Statehouse roughly three weeks after their House counterparts to discuss redistricting, though none shared specifics with media following the caucus.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who leads the Republican body, declined to comment as he left the Senate caucus room.
Also on Wednesday, a national poll found that most Republicans want to ban mid-decade redistricting even as a group sends texts encouraging Hoosiers to support the move.

The two-hour meeting follows a Washington D.C. trip last month where Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston met personally with President Donald Trump to discuss redistricting. Trump and his allies have identified Indiana as an opportunity to grow the slim Republican majority in Congress.
Just two of Indiana’s nine congressional districts are held by Democrats, limiting pick-up opportunities. But with Republican supermajorities in both chambers, and a GOP governor, there’s little opponents can do to halt the process.
Despite the pressure, Indiana’s leaders haven’t yet scheduled a special session and the vast majority of Republican lawmakers have been silent on the issue. Several other senators leaving Wednesday’s meeting also declined to comment or share their perspective — though both Sens. Spencer Deery and Greg Walker have been vocal about their opposition.
The state’s entire Republican delegation in the U.S. House has come out in favor of redistricting, though doing so will shift the boundary lines of their districts. Congressional representatives aren’t required to live in the area they serve.
Members of the House Republican caucus are set to meet Friday.
 Pro-redistricting texts

Texts sent by the conservative-leaning Forward America started showing back up Tuesday — urging Hoosiers to contact their local representative to support redistricting. 
“Radical progressives like Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker, and Kathy Hochul are plotting to stop President Trump’s agenda by redistricting their states and wiping out the conservative majority in Congress. Our state legislators have the power to counter the radical progressives’ power grab by doing our own redistricting here in Indiana,” one message read.
The U.S. Constitution requires a count of “all persons” every 10 years. 
Poll: Most Hoosiers oppose mid-decade redistricting, want focus on daily challenges

So far, the only state that has redistricted off-cycle is Texas, a Republican state. Another red state, Missouri, is in the middle of a special session doing the same. 
Forward America was also responsible for robocalls to Hoosiers last month — resulting in several complaints to the Attorney General’s Office. That office didn’t return a request seeking an update. 
The group is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a 501c4 nonprofit out of Alexandria, Virginia. The principal officer is Blaise Hazelwood, a Republican strategist and consultant. 
Forward America has been around since at least 2019 and reported gross receipts of less than $50,000 for the 2024 tax period. It doesn’t have to make public its donors, which is why some refer to it as dark money.
Hazelwood is the owner of Grassroots Targeting LLC — a microtargeting company that tailors messages to certain voters.  
She served as the Republican National Committee’s political director in 2002 and 2004 and spearheaded the development of Voter Vault, the first online national voter file, her company bio said. 
Hazelwood launched Grassroots in 2005 to “provide accurate and actionable data — modeling every precinct in the nation.” The firm has consulted on winning presidential, senatorial and congressional campaigns as well as 19 governors. 
Hazelwood did not return a call seeking comment from the Capital Chronicle.
 A poll against redistricting

The same day as the GOP caucus, voting rights advocate Common Cause released a poll reporting that 64% of Republican and independent voters want to ban mid-decade redistricting. 
Common Cause commissioned Noble Predictive Insights to conduct the poll between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. It surveyed more than 2,000 registered voters nationally and an additional 400 to 500 registered voters in Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois and California.

“In very clear terms, our poll shows even Republicans in red states like Indiana don’t want mid-decade redistricting,” said Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana. “But this White House is insistent on trying to twist the arms of Indiana lawmakers. We urge lawmakers in Indiana and Washington to follow the data and put an end to gerrymandering once and for all.” 
Additionally, the poll found that the majority of voters in each state supported independent commissions to draw district boundaries, rather than state lawmakers. Sixty percent of voters who supported Trump in 2024 reportedly want Congress to ban mid-decade redistricting.
A left-leaning pollster last month similarly concluded that the majority of Hoosiers, or 52%, opposed redrawing maps. Traditionally, districts are redrawn following the once-in-a-decade census. The state’s current maps were drawn in 2021.

A press release from the Governor’s Office said Department of Environmental Quality director Sonja Nowakowski will chair the task force and Gianforte will appoint members of the task force “in[...],"Transmission lines. States Newsroom file photoRepublican Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Wednesday he is launching a task force to provide recommendations and strategies for Montana to unleash American-made energy.
A press release from the Governor’s Office said Department of Environmental Quality director Sonja Nowakowski will chair the task force and Gianforte will appoint members of the task force “in the coming days,” with its first meeting planned for Sept. 22.
With increasing demand on our energy grid, we must meet the challenge head-on to ensure affordable, reliable power for Montanans now and into the future,” Gianforte said in a statement. “After four years of failed Biden energy policies that drove up energy costs, we need innovative ideas to unleash American-made energy in our state. Montana is ready to lead, and this task force will build on our natural strengths as a state rich in energy resources.”
The task force  is charged with providing shot- and long-term recommendations and strategies for the state to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy options.
In the executive order establishing the task force, Gianforte emphasizes that Montana follows an “all-of-the-above approach to energy, supporting the expansion of energy production in every sector and avoiding market distortions by not picking winners and losers.”
Gianforte cited a report from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council that says electricity demand in the western states is expected to grow 20% during the next decade, a growth rate almost twice what was forecast in 2022. It is also four times the historical growth rate from 2013 and 2022.
Montana has historically been a net exporter of electricity, but that shifted in recent years. In 2023, NorthWestern Energy noted in its annual report that the monopoly energy company is “predominantly a net importer, especially during peak demand.”
Gianforte’s executive order highlights the state’s diverse energy portfolio, which includes coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower, wind and solar.
Roughly 37% of Montana’s in-state electricity production is generated from coal-fired power plants, while 57% is generated from renewable energy sources — primarily hydropower — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Gianforte has repeatedly stated that Montana stands ready to help President Donald Trump’s efforts towards unleashing America’s energy resources.
In his first days back in office, Trump declared a “national energy emergency” which he partially defined as an inadequate energy supply and infrastructure which led to high prices.
Both the nation, and Montana, have reached all-time energy production numbers in recent years. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. production from all sources reached consecutive all-time highs in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Montana Electric Power Generating Capacity by Fuel Type, 1970-2024 (Total MW Capacity)Chart by DEQ.
In Montana, DEQ data mirrors that with the state reaching its highest electric power generating capacity in 2024.
The increase in capacity over the last decade is primarily due to additional wind power, which makes up 27% of the state’s electricity capacity. Coal capacity makes up roughly 23%, natural gas 8% and solar 3%, according to DEQ.
“Montana has a long history of responsible energy development,” Nowakowski said. “As we face growing demand for electricity, it’s time to build on that legacy with innovation and investment in energy resources. This task force will convene leaders in Montana’s energy sector to identify the barriers and develop a strategy to deliver affordable, dependable energy for Montana families and the businesses ready to invest in our state.”
A recent vote by the U.S. House overturned a Biden-era resource management plan which blocked new coal leases on millions of acres of land across eastern Montana, including the Powder River Basin, which contains close to a third of the nation’s accessible coal reserves.
In a letter sent to the Trump administration, Gov. Greg Gianforte urged the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana, including by reopening Bureau of Land Management acreage to coal leases, to benefit national security, provide reliable energy and boost Montana’s educational systems.
The governor’s office stated that while the governor’s task force may recommend any strategy increase the supply of affordable, reliable energy, Gianforte expressly asked the task force to “provide recommendations that provide Montana energy producers and consumers with greater certainty in the market, stable delivery systems for electricity, efficient permitting and regulatory systems, and an end to frivolous litigation designed to delay or thwart responsible, environmentally-sound energy development.”
Gianforte’s energy task force will hold its first meeting on Sept 22 and is expected to produce a written report with recommendation and strategies by Sept. 15, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 16:57:16.641437

Ned Lamont endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy.","Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday endorsed the potential state purchase of a share of the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun as a savvy investment, not a subsidy of a franchise currently in play for a possible sale and relocation.
“Ask Mohegan Sun whether it was a good investment they made 20 years ago,” Lamont said.
The Mohegan Tribal Nation, the owner of the Mohegan Sun casino, purchased the team in 2003 and relocated it the arena in its casino complex. The tribe paid $10 million and currently is entertaining offers exceeding $300 million.
Lamont and Treasurer Erick Russell discussed the WNBA as a viable investment for a pension fund at a press conference announcing that the state pension funds are outperforming peers, with an annual return exceeding 10%.
“It’s been a very hot area,” Russell said. “This has been a big topic all around the country. We’ve seen other public pension plans that have invested in the space, particularly in women’s basketball.”
Industry newsletters and publications have been noting the interest in sports franchises as an investment over the past year, as one sports law web site reported in July.
“From Undervalued to Unstoppable: The Rise of Women’s Sports as a Prime Investment Asset,” was the headline of a story saying women’s sports are attractive for their lower entry price and high ceiling for growth in value.

House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, criticized Lamont for endorsing what Candelora called “a very high-risk investment with our pension market.” 
“In general, investing in a sports team is a very risky proposition,” Candelora said, adding that Connecticut, situated between larger media markets in New York and Boston, has a checkered past when it comes to enticing top-level sports franchises to relocate or remain here.
Nuccio praised Russell’s pension performance but argued that the pension investment should go to safer places.
Flirtations with the New England Patriots ended poorly, and the NHL’s Hartford Whalers decamped for North Carolina in 1997 after a quarter-century in Hartford.
But Lamont and Russell said the value of the investment in Connecticut Sun is tied to the steady appreciation of equity positions in franchise ownerships, regardless of their balance sheet or whether they ultimately relocate.
“We’ve got private investors in alongside of us. In fact, junior to us. They like the nature of this investment. They think it’s a really good, solid, long term return for him and for our investors,” Lamont said.

RJ May, R-West Columbia,  listens from the back of the House chamber during an organizational session on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024 at the Statehouse in Columbia, SC. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former state Rep. RJ May walked into federal court Wednesday with a legal motion consisting of 32 pages handwritten on the front and back of lined paper.
May, a founder of the South Carolina House’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, opted last week to defend himself against charges of distributing images and videos of children being sexually abused. That means he must prepare for his October trial from his cell at the Edgefield County jail.
He has remained there without bond since his arrest June 11. He resigned his House seat last month, amid the federal charges and an ongoing investigation into his conduct by the House Ethics Committee.
May’s former public defense attorneys are on standby to help answer legal questions, but they can’t help with the actual content of his case, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie reminded May during a half-hour hearing Wednesday morning.
May used some of that help in court Wednesday. When prosecutors used legal jargon to describe how their evidence was numbered, May told the judge his standby attorneys were explaining the numbering system to him.
He also asked Currie whether he could request a sample motion from an unrelated case to make sure his own motions were formatted correctly, which Currie approved.
To build his defense, May will go back and forth between the jail and the Office of Homeland Security in Columbia — a roughly 75-minute drive each way. The judge said he could make that trip as often as necessary.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office has set up a room with a computer displaying all the evidence against him, and May can bring bagged lunches from the jail to eat while he goes through it, prosecutor Scott Matthews said Wednesday.
May’s first trip to that room followed the hearing.
There is a “tremendous amount of data to go through” in May’s case, public defender Jenny Smith, one of May’s standby attorneys, said previously. Currie asked May to get through as much as possible ahead of a hearing on his pre-trial motions Sept. 24.
May will be able to bring documents back to his jail cell, as long as they don’t contain objectionable images, Currie said. He also has access to a tablet with the application Fastcase, a legal research system that May called the “poor man’s Westlaw,” referring to the more expensive legal research website available on state prisoners’ tablets.
Jailed suspects can also use the tablets to send messages, receive approved images and emails and make phone calls, according to the Edgefield County Sheriff’s Office. May has told relatives that he can use his tablet to listen to music or play games if he pays for them, according to messages obtained through an open records request.
May does not yet have access to the list of rules for federal criminal proceedings, he said, but Currie promised him attorneys would give that to him if the jail couldn’t.
May also can’t access the online court filing system from jail, meaning he has to visit the federal courthouse in Columbia each time he wants to file a motion, as he did Wednesday.
He will come back to court next Wednesday to file any remaining pre-trial motions and receive prosecutors’ motions, Currie said.
The motion May filed Wednesday asked Currie to throw out a search warrant used to collect cellphones, laptops, thumb drives and other electronics from his house in August 2024.
While asking for the warrant, Britton Lorenzen, a special agent for Homeland Security, told a magistrate that investigators were likely to find images or videos depicting child sexual abuse even though the tip was several months old by that point because people who collect such images don’t usually get rid of them, according to a sworn statement included with May’s motion.
During May’s June detention hearing, Lorenzen said it was “very, very common” not to find actual images and videos of child sexual abuse on a suspect’s phone or computer because of how easy it is to save media to the cloud or various apps.
May argued those statements contradicted each other, suggesting Lorenzen was lying in her statement to receive the search warrant.
Without that information, May argued, the search warrant was invalid and anything found on his devices couldn’t be used in court. Lorenzen’s assertion that people who collect child sexual abuse materials was integral to the judge issuing the warrant, and without it, the judge likely wouldn’t have signed off, May argued.
While investigators didn’t find videos or images on May’s devices, they did find other evidence linking May’s phone and laptop to a messaging account flagged for sending videos showing children being sexually abused, Lorenzen testified during his detention hearing. Data on May’s phone suggested that he had repeatedly typed “joebidennnn69,” the username of the flagged account, and that the Kik messaging app, along with several other encrypted apps, had been deleted from the device.
Investigators also tracked the IP address used to send the messages back to May’s house and personal phone, investigators said.
A hearing on that motion, along with any others filed in the coming weeks, is scheduled for Sept. 24.

A U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily pausing a series of federal policies aimed at restricting certain immigrants’ access to public benefits and programs.


California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island. 
In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.
California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve. 
In a hearing last month, Jessica Ranucci, a lawyer for the Attorney General’s Office of the State of New York, said the new policies mean that a slew of federally funded programs could all be required to verify immigration status before providing any help. Affected programs include suicide hotlines, mental health services, homeless shelters, soup kitchen, domestic violence and child abuse prevention services. Adult schools, which offer many English-language classes, and the free preschool program Head Start would also be required to deny entry to certain students. The new policies could exclude “millions of people” from “life-saving services,” said Ranucci, including U.S. citizens who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence but lack the right paperwork. 
A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies reflect the proper interpretation of federal law and that government programs should be able to easily verify legal status. 
U.S. district judge Mary McElroy disagreed and repeatedly questioned Skedzielewski in the hearing about the practicality of verifying the legal status of every participant. “How is this not a giant unfunded federal mandate to the states?” she asked, referring to the burden it would put on service providers. “What do we do with someone who is having a mental health crisis and maybe doesn’t even know their own name?” 
The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”  
Who qualifies for public benefits? 
In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions. 
Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all. 
As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.  
In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county. 
Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community. 
Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.
It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps. 
In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer. 
All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases. 
Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.
At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A week after Gov. Dan McKee asked to meet with President Donald Trump over the administration’s halt to the Revolution Wind project, he’s still waiting for an answer.
But U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is suggesting the paused project might not be dead in the water after all. In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Burgum, whose office oversees federal permits for offshore wind projects, indicated the administration was open to letting work resume on the 65-turbine project.
Burgum said in the interview that the administration was “under discussions,” with McKee and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and with project developers. Rhode Island and Connecticut were under agreements to buy power from the project after it became operational next year.
“We’re also finishing the reviews that we’ve been asked and required to make through the executive orders,” Burgum said.
The Aug. 22 letter from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to Danish wind developer Orsted A/S, ordering construction to cease on Revolution Wind, cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo which put an indefinite pause on federal approvals for offshore wind projects.
“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,” Matthew Giacona, BOEM acting director, wrote in the letter to Orsted.
The move prompted immediate and mounting backlash by state and federal officials over the economic and environmental consequences of the stop work order, which halted a project already 80% complete. 
McKee reiterated the risks to thousands of labor union jobs, state climate change mandates and grid reliability in his Sept. 3 letter to Burgum, in which he asked to meet with Trump. No meeting has been held or scheduled as of Wednesday, said Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office. She did not respond to follow-up questions regarding if there was any communications between the governor and the administration.
A day after McKee called for a one-on-one with the White House came a pair of lawsuits, filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general and by the project developers, respectively. The complaints — one filed in Rhode Island and the other in D.C. — both seek court intervention to reverse the stop work order on Revolution Wind, arguing it violates constitutional separation of powers protections. The federal administration has not yet responded to either complaint, according to public court dockets. 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in an interview Wednesday said he believes the federal courts are the only way to revive Revolution Wind.
“This president is not turning wind back online willingly,” Neronha said.
Indeed, Burgum lambasted the offshore wind industry overall, calling the projects “a literal train wreck in terms of their economics,” in his CNBC interview.
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Interior, declined to offer additional comment when contacted Wednesday afternoon. 
Orsted and its development partner have already invested or committed $5 billion into the project off Block Island, and expects to face another $1 billion in “breakaway costs” if the project is canceled, according to its court complaint.
Meanwhile, regional ratepayers across New England could face a $500 million annual increase in supply prices starting in 2028 without the project, according to Connecticut energy officials. Specific bill impacts in Rhode Island have not been determined, though the fixed price by which Rhode Island Energy will purchase power from the wind project is more than 33% lower than the winter electric rate the company proposed for the six-month period beginning Oct. 1.

The group has organized weekly gatherings on Saturdays for the past several months in front of the luxury resort Bishop's Lodge in a dispute over a sewage treatment project. (Courtesy of Protect Tesuque)An administrative hearing officer on Sept. 8 issued a formal recommendation that New Mexico environment officials approve the wastewater permit by a luxury resort surrounding housing development, over the objections from Tesuque Village residents.
Earlier this year, the New Mexico Environment Department gave initial approval for a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development in Tesuque to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.
State environment officials and the owner of Bishop’s Lodge have repeatedly emphasized that the water from the new wastewater treatment plant is “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
Tensions have been building for the last year, as dozens of residents in the village of about 1,000 have opposed multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort, claiming the method will pollute drinking wells downstream, and that state officials are unequally enforcing water treatment standards.
Opposition coalesced into the organization Protect Tesuque, which has mounted weekly protests, and filed objections during administrative proceedings and in the courts. In July, the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out an emergency petition by the group Protect Tesuque to stop the permitting process.
Hearing Officer Felicia Orth — who operates similarly to a judge in administrative hearings — issued a 66-page recommendation Wednesday saying she found no reason to deny the permit under the law.
NMED Secretary James Kenney’s approval is the final step needed to finalize the permit. Drew Goretzka, an NMED spokesperson, told Source NM approval is required within 30 days of the report’s filing.
Orth addressed objectors directly in her order, saying that “[Protect Tesuque’s] proposed findings and conclusions were not suitable for inclusion.” She wrote the group’s arguments were inaccurate, noting that objections called the project “an open sewer,” which is false.
“This language may have effectively inflamed emotions in the community, but it is unhelpful in a pleading. None of the scary-sounding conjecture in the proposed findings around the potential for the random introduction of pharmaceuticals or hazardous materials provides a basis for permit denial,” Orth wrote.
She further noted that state officials will require Bishop’s Lodge to sample the treated wastewater for additional pollutants within the next 90 days and to require further treatment or testing if contamination is found.
The resort welcomed the hearing officer’s decision, said Chris Kaplan, the head of Asset Management at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge.
“We are encouraged by the hearing officer’s report, and we look forward to continuing to operate our new advanced wastewater treatment facility in compliance with the law and all permit requirements,” Kaplan said in a statement. “Bishop’s Lodge has been in operation for more than half a century; and, as the report acknowledged, the evidence presented in the May 2025 hearing demonstrates that the Lodge’s upgraded wastewater treatment facility meets all New Mexico water quality standards and then some.”
Emails and texts to members of Protect Tesuque requesting comment were not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon.
Bishop’s Lodge and members of Protect Tesque are currently embroiled in a separate legal battle. In July, Bishop’s Lodge sued Protect Tesuque and individual lawmakers, requesting a district judge ban protests in front of the resort within a 1-mile radius, claiming they are a danger to drivers and veer into harassment.

Protect Tesuque has said the claims are exaggerated and is a form of retaliation.
“Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,” said Rusty Day, Tesuque resident and Protect Tesuque board member in a Sept. 7 news release. “This lawsuit isn’t about justice — it’s about silencing community members who are standing up for their water, their land, and their rights.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico — which does not represent Protect Tesuque —  weighed in this week, issuing a statement of support.
“We are deeply concerned about corporations weaponizing the legal system to intimidate New Mexicans into silence,” said Kristin Greer Love, an attorney with the ACLU of New Mexico. “Bishop Lodge’s lawsuit is a textbook example of using the legal system to retaliate and intimidate. The goal is to intimidate a community organization, drain their resources, and chill the speech of anyone else who might oppose them. All New Mexicans must be able to speak out on matters of public concern without fear.”
A Santa Fe judge has set a hearing for Nov. 3 in the case.

As President Trump’s immigration crackdown intensifies, many immigrants who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years are getting snatched by masked agents and disappeared into a vast network of jails across   the country.
In Vermont, a small but growing group of young attorneys have thrown themselves into the fight to defend the immigrants’ rights. Newly minted lawyers, including recent graduates of Vermont Law and Graduate School, are now going head to head with lawyers from Trump’s Justice Department.
The attorneys have been going into Vermont’s jails and encountering terrified immigrants, many of whom are being repeatedly shuffled between states in what appears to be a deliberate effort to frustrate their attempts to obtain effective legal representation. Some detainees do not even know where they are. 
Vermont Asylum Assistance Project  (VAAP), headed by immigration attorney Jill Martin Diaz, has been a driving force behind the effort to mobilize lawyers and defend immigrants. VAAP has grown from one staff member in 2024 to what will be a staff of eight by November, including four new attorneys who are part of the national Immigrant Justice Corps. VAAP recently received a $100,000 grant from the recently established Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to hire staff, bring in attorneys and train Vermont lawyers to handle immigration cases.
Martin Diaz formerly taught immigration law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, directed its Center for Justice Reform Clinic and practiced at Vermont Legal Aid. They currently are a lecturer in the department of social work at the University of Vermont. In 2023, Martin Diaz was named by the LGBTQ+ Bar Association as one of the 40 best LGBTQ+ lawyers under 40.
I visited VAAP’s headquarters in Burlington, where I interviewed Martin Diaz, staff attorney Leah Brenner and volunteer staff attorney Andy Pelcher.
“I’m looking around at our office that’s not even unpacked and we barely have lights and WiFi. How are we holding our own against Trump’s Department of Justice that just got a big, beautiful raise?” marveled Martin Diaz, who described fighting the Trump administration as akin to David vs. Goliath.

Martin Diaz said that immigrants are “canaries in the coal mine.”
“People are really starting to look at what’s going on in the immigration system as a microcosm for what could happen to our democracy if left unchecked, not just for noncitizens, but for everyone.”
Pelcher, who graduated Vermont Law and Graduate School in 2018 and went on to get an LLM, or master of laws, described a recent visit to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he encountered a Palestinian man who was a survivor of torture who “had been bounced around to a number of facilities during the 14 months that he had been detained.” Somehow he landed in a Vermont jail. 
“People are being frequently transferred from facility to facility, seemingly as a means to deny access to counsel, family, local networks of support, and any other means by which these individuals can meaningfully prepare for their defense against removal,” said Pelcher. VAAP, together with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, took on the man’s case.
VAAP’s experience finding and aiding immigrants in Vermont’s jails has led Martin Diaz to oppose the idea of closing Vermont’s jails to ICE. “I would not advocate for more beds, but I would also strongly caution against a wholesale end to ICE’s ability to detain people in our state,” they said. “The truth is that there is no substitute for lawyers getting in their cars, going to a facility with our bodies and meeting one on one in private with our clients directly.”
“It’s really, really difficult to provide people with legal help telephonically, when the people who have your clients in custody have no respect for the rule of law and for individuals rights.”
Is America’s legal system up to the task of defending rights and institutions in the Trump era?
“I do have hope that the rule of law will prevail and that this horrible, horrible, tragic moment in our history, this painful moment for our community members who are being directly impacted, can also be a galvanizing opportunity for us to rethink what do we want our laws to say? What do we want due process to look like? What checks and balances do we want?” said Martin Diaz.

Photo by Mike Clark/For the Daily Montanan)OKLAHOMA CITY – Drag shows containing obscenity in public places or in front of children are illegal, according to an Oklahoma Attorney General’s opinion released Wednesday.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the binding opinion describes “clear red lines” to determine when the performances are free speech or a punishable crime.
Under Oklahoma law, obscene material includes depictions of sexual conduct that meet three criteria, the opinion said.
First, it is patently offensive as determined by the average person applying contemporary community standards, the opinion said.
Second, it appeals to prurient interest in sex as a dominant theme, the opinion said.
Finally, it lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value, the opinion said.
Sexual conduct includes intercourse, sodomy, masturbation, or exhibiting genitals or pubic areas, the opinion said.
Whether specific drag performances meet those elements involves fact questions outside the scope of the opinion, the opinion said.
Drummond said he would be issuing guidance to law enforcement.  
Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, asked for the opinion after the passage of House Bill 1217, which became effective in May. Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, and Sen. David Bullard, D-Durant, were the authors.

The law prohibits individuals from performing sexually explicit or obscene acts in public places or areas where minors are present. It bans political subdivisions from authorizing the performances.
The new law created some confusion, she said.
“I think it was necessary to clarify the issue, and this opinion certainly did do that,” Daniels said.
She said the issue of drag performances in outdoor public facilities in front of children had been a topic of discussion in her community.

Read it here.
Los residentes de los alrededores de Salton Sea se han quejado durante mucho tiempo de enfermedades respiratorias causadas por la contaminación que produce el lago.
Ahora los investigadores de la UCLA han identificado otro contaminante del aire que podría estar enfermando a las personas en las comunidades cercanas al lago: sulfuro de hidrógeno.
Se trata de un gas procedente de materia orgánica en descomposición que produce olor a huevo podrido y se asocia con irritación ocular, dolor de cabeza, náuseas y otros síntomas. En dos informes publicados la semana pasada, el Instituto de Política Latina de UCLA describió cómo las floraciones de algas producen este gas en el agua y cómo se propaga por los barrios cercanos.
 “Las comunidades que viven junto a la costa o a menos de una milla de ella están expuestas al sulfuro de hidrógeno”, dijo Consuelo A. Márquez, autora de los informes junto con Alejandra López e Isabella B. Arzeno-Soltero. “Escuchamos historias: ‘Mi hijo sufre de hemorragias nasales crónicas y ha tenido asma toda su vida’”.
El Salton Sea cruza los condados de Riverside e Imperial, y es el lago más grande de California. Sin duda, también es el más contaminado. Con casi el doble de salinidad que el océano, está contaminado por escorrentías agrícolas y floraciones de algas tóxicas. A pesar de su contaminación, el mar es un refugio para más de 400 especies de aves y una parada clave en la Ruta Migratoria del Pacífico, una de las principales rutas migratorias de aves de Norteamérica.
 California creó recientemente la Reserva del Mar Salton para restaurar el hábitat de las aves y la vida acuática. Los defensores de la comunidad afirman que es necesario prestar mayor atención al impacto del lago en la salud pública de las comunidades vecinas.

 “Necesitan ayuda para recibir tratamiento, medicamentos o atención relacionada con posibles problemas cardiovasculares y respiratorios”, dijo Márquez. “Está ocurriendo con una frecuencia tan alta que muchos simplemente viven con ello. Creo que se debería prestar más atención a esto”.
Los estudios de UCLA encontraron estos problemas midiendo las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno en el lago. Un estudio se centró en cómo se produce esta sustancia química en el agua. Las altas concentraciones de nitratos provenientes de la escorrentía de fertilizantes y los bajos niveles de oxígeno en la columna de agua crean un entorno que genera gases de sulfuro de hidrógeno.
 El segundo estudio analizó las concentraciones de sulfuro de hidrógeno en el aire . Los investigadores instalaron dos monitores adicionales de sulfuro de hidrógeno en la zona y descubrieron que las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno superan constantemente el estándar estatal de la Junta de Recursos del Aire de California de 30 partes por mil millones. Registraron 243 horas por encima de este umbral tan solo entre mayo y septiembre de 2024.
 En esos niveles, e incluso en concentraciones más bajas, la sustancia química puede causar numerosos problemas de salud, según la Administración de Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional de EE. UU . Estos incluyen náuseas, irritación ocular, dolor de cabeza, insomnio, problemas respiratorios, fatiga, irritabilidad, mala memoria, mareos, entre otros.
 “A medida que más datos resaltan la conexión entre el agua y la calidad del aire, es crucial monitorear la calidad del aire en todos sus aspectos, no solo los relacionados con el polvo”, afirma el informe, señalando que la región alberga principalmente a residentes latinos, nativos americanos e inmigrantes. “El problema persistente de la contaminación por sulfuro de hidrógeno es un claro ejemplo de injusticia ambiental”.
 El Mar Saltón no es la única zona con este problema. Las emisiones de sulfuro de hidrógeno también afectan zonas del condado de San Diego afectadas por la contaminación del río Tijuana . En partes de South Bay San Diego, investigadores del Instituto Scripps de Oceanografía de la Universidad de California en San Diego, la Universidad de California en Riverside, la Universidad Estatal de San Diego y agencias federales encontraron concentraciones de sulfuro de hidrógeno aproximadamente 4500 veces superiores a las típicas de una zona urbana, según un informe publicado el mes pasado.
 Márquez afirmó que los investigadores de la UCLA solicitan un enfoque holístico de sistemas para mejorar la calidad del aire en la zona del Mar Saltón. Esto podría incluir la distribución de purificadores y monitores de calidad del aire para que los residentes puedan participar activamente en la mejora de las condiciones. También necesitan un mejor acceso a tratamiento médico para posibles problemas cardiovasculares y respiratorios. Sobre todo, los residentes quieren asegurarse de que sus preocupaciones sean escuchadas y atendidas, añadió.
 “Las mejores personas que pueden crear soluciones son las mismas personas afectadas”, afirmó.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020423-Salton-Sea_AD_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 16:57:16.641437

Ned Lamont on Wednesday issued a slew of executive actions seeking to protect COVID-19 vaccine access in Connecticut amid recent federal changes that are causing confusion over who’s eligible for shots, where people can get them and how much they’re going to cost. 
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration limited its approval of updated boosters to people 65 and older, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. As a result, access to the booster for anyone who falls outside those categories has been in flux. 
But the executive actions announced today by the Lamont administration buck the federal changes. 
The state’s Department of Public Health is encouraging children 6 months and older, as well as adults of all ages, to get vaccinated. Guidance issued by the Department of Consumer Protection seeks to facilitate access to the boosters at local pharmacies, and a bulletin from the Connecticut Insurance Department guarantees coverage of the shots for certain residents.
“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” Lamont stated in a Wednesday press release. 
Here’s what you need to know.
Who can get a booster in Connecticut?
On Aug. 27, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, under the leadership of the Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., approved the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 65 as well as anyone with an underlying health condition that puts them at risk for severe outcomes from the virus. 
The announcement upended guidance from the past several years that allowed anyone 6 months or older to get the vaccine.
The state’s Department of Public Health issued interim guidance on Wednesday stating that all residents who qualify for a booster based on the FDA’s eligibility criteria, as well as children ages 6 to 23 months, “should” get the vaccine. It also directs that anyone 6 months or older, regardless of underlying health, “can” get a booster.
Guidance issued to pharmacists by the Department of Consumer Protection allows anyone who falls outside of the FDA eligibility criteria to show up at their local pharmacy and get a vaccine or make an appointment without a prescription, a spokesperson with the state’s Department of Consumer Protection confirmed.
“DCP has met with both CVS and Walgreens, as well as the National Association of Chain Drugstores (NACDS) and Walmart regarding this guidance,” the spokesperson stated in emailed comments. “Our guidance offers the ability for a person who falls outside the FDA eligibility criteria to show up at a CVS or Walgreens (or any other pharmacy) without a prescription.”
Prior to Lamont’s announcement, spokespeople with CVS and Walgreens confirmed that Connecticut residents could stop by a pharmacy or sign up to get the vaccine without a prescription if they were in the populations approved for the booster by the FDA. Patients can self-attest their eligibility, and no proof or additional documentation is required. 
Those who do not qualify can still receive the vaccine with a prescription from their provider, a spokesperson with CVS confirmed. 
But the CDC’s list of qualifying underlying conditions that can lead to severe COVID-19  is extensive. It includes conditions like asthma, depression and substance use disorder. People with a BMI of 25 or greater, those who are “physically inactive,” as well as anyone who is a current or former smoker, also qualify.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Lamont acknowledged that the state’s guidance conflicted with federal guidance and that it could take a couple of weeks for pharmacies to sort out.
“I’d say it’s a little tricky for a national pharmacy company to get some rulings from the feds and Health and Human Services and then different ideas from the state. They’re trying to get that balance right as well,” Lamont said.
Lamont said he’d be reluctant to use emergency powers — calling it a “last resort” — to mandate pharmacies to broadly administer the vaccine but would wait a couple of weeks to see what’s needed to ensure Connecticut residents have access to the boosters.
“If the pharmacists say, ‘That’s not enough for us because we worry about pushback from the feds,’ we’ll have to revisit that in a week or two,” he said. 
The Connecticut Hospital Association applauded the state’s actions.
“These efforts are critical in supporting patients and protecting communities across the state. As we enter respiratory virus season, individuals are encouraged to protect themselves and their families from preventable infections. Vaccination remains one of the most effective tools we have to reduce illness and safeguard public health,” a CHA spokesperson stated in a press release.
How much will it cost?
Nearly all insurance carriers are required to cover vaccines at no cost if they are recommended by what’s known as the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. ACIP’s recommendations are separate from the FDA approval issued last month. ACIP has not yet issued recommendations regarding this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. 
The committee is scheduled to meet next on Sept. 18-19, at which point coverage of the boosters could become clearer. There have been instances where ACIP’s recommendations differed from the FDA’s initial approval.
In June, Kennedy came under fire for abruptly firing all 17 members of ACIP. Days later, he appointed eight members to serve on the panel, including several who had previously advocated against vaccines.
On Wednesday, Connecticut took steps to secure insurance coverage of the COVID-19 booster for certain residents, even if ACIP ends up recommending otherwise.
A bulletin issued by the Department of Insurance confirmed that coverage for COVID-19 vaccines is mandatory under Connecticut state law under all “Connecticut-issued policies, regardless of ACIP’s position.”
However, Connecticut only has jurisdiction over what are known as “fully insured” individual and small group plans, which cover roughly 250,000 people, or 8% of the state. 
Many large employers have what are known as “self-funded” plans, where the employer pays for employees’ health care costs directly, instead of paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier. Absent a recommendation by ACIP that would mandate coverage across most providers, self-funded plans would get to decide whether to cover the cost of the booster for their enrollees. 
Chris DiPentima, the president of CBIA, Connecticut’s largest business group, did not directly answer a question regarding whether Connecticut’s large employers would voluntarily follow suit and cover the cost of the booster. 
“Employers who use self-funded plans will adopt a holistic approach to this, considering employee health and wellness along with their overall compensation and benefits package,” DiPentima stated in emailed comments.
CT DPH recommends that anyone seeking the vaccine confirm coverage with their health plan.

(Pool photo by Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)TOPEKA — A trucker wants the Kansas Supreme Court to settle a dispute about an administrative decision by the Kansas Department of Revenue to suspend his commercial driver’s license despite securing a diversion agreement on a DUI charge in Olathe.
The case on oral argument Wednesday before the Supreme Court originated with trucker David Vogt’s appeal in Johnson County District Court of the revenue department’s unilateral suspension action. District Judge Rhonda Mason determined a diversion cannot be defined as a conviction for purposes of evaluating license suspensions, but the Department of Revenue appealed.
A subsequent ruling by the Kansas Court of Appeals said district courts in Kansas lacked jurisdiction to consider challenges to Department of Revenue administrative directives relative to CDL privileges. The Court of Appeals directed Mason to reverse her order in the Vogt case.
“The Court of Appeals got it completely right,” said Charles Bradley, an attorney representing the Department of Revenue. “Based on Kansas law, a court does not have jurisdiction to review a conviction-based suspension in this matter. If this court determines that a diversion is not actually a conviction, which I’m sure it is, then unfortunately KDOR does not have authority or subject matter jurisdiction to do anything.”
Bradley’s theory inspired questions from Justice Eric Rosen, who served as a district court judge in Shawnee County before being appointed to the state’s highest court.
“How does one contest whether the driver was convicted of a DUI? Let’s just say it was a mistake … that the notice of the conviction was for the wrong person. There’s a mistake, but the KDR goes ahead and suspends this commercial driver’s license. What recourse does a person in Mr. Vogt’s position have? It seems like there is none,” Rosen said.
“Fortunately, such an error would never occur,” Bradley replied. “A conviction-based suspension can be reviewed by KDR. The person can submit written requests for review. We take a look at it. There is no hearing.”
Justice Melissa Taylor Standridge pressed Bradley about the Department of Revenue’s conclusion state law blocked a person from seeking due process through the judicial system.
“As a matter of law, would that also include challenging whether a diversion is a conviction?” she asked.
Brandan Davies, an Overland Park attorney representing Vogt, said his client received a DUI in 2021 while driving his personal vehicle in Kansas.
Davies said the Supreme Court shouldn’t allow the Department of Revenue to define a diversion in a way that precluded people from attempting to challenge administrative findings in district court.
“The definition of ‘conviction’ is at the heart of the merit of this case, but then also … whether or not the Court of Appeals opinion is correct,” he said.
For many years, Davies said, DUI attorneys as well as city and state courts operated under the belief that Kansas law forbid commercial driver’s license holders from securing a diversion for driving under the influence. In 2022, then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt issued a legal opinion that said CDL holders were eligible for diversion.
Under the assumption Vogt would be allowed to retain his CDL, Davies said Vogt entered into an agreement with the city of Olathe to resolve the DUI.
“There was no penalty taken administratively on his driver’s license,” Davies said. “Mr. Vogt had a CDL. He was saving his job. He had a diversion.”
At that point, the Department of Revenue put Vogt on notice that his CDL would be suspended for 12 months because, in the view of the state agency, state law characterized diversions as convictions.
“The state misclassified or intentionally classified diversion as a conviction and suspended his driver’s license,” Davies said.
In the original district court ruling, Judge Mason said a failure to provide Vogt with advance notice concerning the potential adverse impact a diversion could have on his CDL compromised his constitutional right to procedural due process.
Rosen indicated he was puzzled the Court of Appeals agreed with the Department of Revenue’s position that certain DUI defendants had no appellate rights in district court.
“Was that ever addressed by the Court of Appeals at oral argument or did this just come as a complete surprise when the opinion was issued?” Rosen said.
“There was no oral argument at the Court of Appeals,” Davies said. “The Court of Appeals sidestepped the merits of the case. They’re just saying, because KDR said it’s a conviction, that you can’t appeal.”
Bradley, representing the Department of Revenue, said state law regulating commercial motor vehicles included provisions directing that a person convicted of DUI must have commercial driving privileges suspended for one year. Unsafe commercial drivers shouldn’t be allowed to mask a DUI by seeking a diversion that kept the incident off a driving record, he said.
“The current case and the treatment of all DUI diversions for all CDL holders is based upon the specific wording used in these statutes,” Bradley said.
He said a first-time DUI offender was required a pay a $750 fine. That financial sanction should to be viewed as the consequence of a conviction, he said.
The Department of Revenue argued, and the Court of Appeals accepted, the notion that the Legislature enacted a path to judicial review only when a CDL was revoked for life after a second or subsequent DUI conviction. This meant there was an avenue to district court for persons who completed a 10-year period of CDL disqualification and had been denied restoration of privileges by the agency.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230201_KSSupCourt.EN_.POOL-17-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 16:57:16.641437

In a new poll for CommonWealth Beacon conducted […],"Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. (Image via Governor's Office Flickr feed)Just over half of Massachusetts residents approve of the job Maura Healey is doing as governor – holding steady according to a new poll – but any challengers aligning themselves with Donald Trump will have to contend with the president’s persistent deep unpopularity in the Bay State.
In a new poll for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – 1,000 Massachusetts residents weighed in on the state and federal executives between August 11 and 18. (Topline | Crosstabs)
Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20% of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36% say they somewhat approve, 15% somewhat disapprove, 18% strongly disapprove, and 11% said they were unsure. The credibility interval is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Most Massachusetts residents have an opinion on Trump’s performance, with only 4% unsure. And they’re more firmly opposed to the president’s actions. Some 48% of the respondents said they strongly disapprove, 12% somewhat disapprove, 18% somewhat approve, and 17% strongly approve.
“Healey looks to me like a conventional Democrat,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling group. “She draws more cross-party support than Trump. Republicans don’t love her, but they also are not united against her the way Democrats oppose Trump.”
Between Healey’s own base and enough independents, he said, it’s a “perfectly fine poll” for the incumbent. “It’s a long campaign with a lot to come,” he said. “But this poll on its own doesn’t feel like a warning sign.”

Though the poll was fielded in August before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a series of moves that will limit who is eligible for COVID vaccines, Bay Staters were already holding Kennedy in generally low regard, though not quite as much as the president. The poll found 56% of residents disapproved of Kennedy’s performance and 34% approved.
Healey last week announced that Massachusetts would chart a new path to break ties with the new federal vaccine policy.
“The government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey said. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.”
Predictably for this era of hyper-partisan and nationalized politics, party affiliation was the major indicator of approval or disapproval for state and federal leadership.
Some 42% of registered Republicans and independents that lean Republican – groups that largely vote the same way – strongly support Trump’s performance, 39% somewhat support him, 9% somewhat disapprove, and just 6% strongly disapprove.
The polarization was even sharper among Democrats. Only 6% of Massachusetts Democrats or independents that lean Democratic said they strongly supported the president’s performance. Three-quarters of the Democrats and leaners strongly oppose Trump’s performance.
The firm majority of registered Republicans and leaners are chilly to Healey’s performance overall. But while 66 percent either strongly or somewhat disapprove of her, 27% said they strongly or somewhat approve of her performance.
The governor does still hold her Democratic base, with 80% of Democrats and leaners saying they approved of her performance. But that was somewhat softer support, split between strong approval and somewhat approving. Only 3% of the group said they strongly disapproved of Healey’s performance.

Her overall numbers are still a far cry from her unusually popular predecessor, Charlie Baker, even as Trump’s first term sparked outrage in the Bay State.
During Baker’s first run for governor, he was widely perceived as stridently partisan – a mismatch for the generally liberal Massachusetts electorate. But after toning down his pitch and winning a tight race against Attorney General Martha Coakley by less than 2 percentage points in 2014, Baker moved to the center with a Mr. Fix-It brand.
In 2017, as midterms approached and the gubernatorial election was just a year away, Baker was viewed favorably by 67% of the state’s voters and held leads of at least 34 points against his three declared Democratic challengers.
By the end of Baker’s term, his support came more from Democrats than Republicans, Koczela noted. “That’s a better formula for Baker,” he said, “since registered Republicans are such a small part of the electorate.”
Healey’s election marked the return of one-party rule on Beacon Hill, and some political watchers mulled that there may be interest in rebalancing the state level partisan math if a strong candidate came along.
Relatively little polling has tested out the odds of Healey’s Republican challengers, Brian Shortsleeve and Mike Kennealy, who both worked in the Baker administration and are currently criticizing each other over fundraising while going after Healey on shelter capacity, crime, and spending. A February UMass Amherst poll found Kennealy trailing Healey 40% to 15%, and Shortsleeve behind 44% to 12.
“Donald Trump has a 35% approval rating,” Koczela noted. “Aligning with him could be helpful in winning a Republican primary but won’t help with the broader electorate. This has been the conundrum for GOP candidates in Massachusetts since Trump came on the scene.”
In net approval – total approval minus total disapproval – Healey struggles with voters without college degrees and is barely above water with true independents and residents of Southeast Massachusetts. That region tends to be the hardest area for Democrats, Koczela said.
Healey also seems to be a bit softer than a Democrat might like among non-white residents, which are generally reliable Democratic voters and with whom the poll shows Healey has net positives of 28 percentage points. Non-white voters in 2024 chose Kamala Harris over Trump in Massachusetts 73% to 25%, a 48-point margin.
Though Massachusetts does not have exit polls during non-presidential years, Healey won cities and towns with heavily Latino populations by healthy margins in 2022. For instance, she won Fall River with 57% of the vote to Geoff Diehl’s 41%.
“In 2024, Massachusetts saw a major realignment, particularly among Latino voters,” Koczela said. “This showed up in places like Lawrence, Fall River, and other Gateway Cities with Trump making major gains over past Republican candidates. Democrats would certainly hope for a strong performance among the state’s voters of color to show this was a one off, and this poll doesn’t clearly point in that direction.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Legislators finalized rules this week allowing additional grounds for challenging a person’s right to vote in South Dakota.
The rules, approved Tuesday by the Interim Rules Review Committee, are a result of Senate Bill 185, which was signed into law in March. It expanded the justifications for challenging voter rights to include claims that a registered voter has died, is not a legal resident of the state or has voted or registered in another state.
Previously, state law allowed challenges based on a person’s identity, a felony conviction or mental incompetency. Those challenges are still allowed.
The new rules were part of a larger package presented by the Secretary of State’s Office and the Board of Elections to align with several “election integrity” bills approved by lawmakers earlier this year. Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who supported the legislation.
Rules not ‘perfect,’ voting official says
Deputy Secretary of State Tom Deadrick told committee members it was “challenging” to “keep the due process in line” for people who are being challenged.
“I’m not going to tell you it’s a perfect package, because I doubt if it’s perfect,” Deadrick said, “but I think it’s a pretty good package that takes care of the legislative intent.”

State Sen. Amber Hulse, R-Hot Springs, sponsored the legislation. She told South Dakota Searchlight that the rules are largely aligned with her bill’s intentions, but she’s concerned that requiring challengers to provide personal information for voters in question could lead to privacy risks for South Dakotans.
There are people on South Dakota’s voter registration list who should not be registered to vote in the state, Hulse said. But the challenge process should be a balance.
“You have to ensure that you’re protecting people’s private information and protecting their right to vote, due process rights and other really big rights that go into these processes,” Hulse said. “It makes it feel clunky or difficult, but that’s purposeful so we’re protecting arguably more important rights than cleaning voter rolls.”
The American Civil Liberties Union-South Dakota’s Samantha Chapman originally opposed the legislation, but worked with Hulse in an attempt to make it less onerous to voters. Chapman said the rules create “stronger protections against indiscriminate challenges” because the documentation “should be hard to track down,” but she said they could be stronger for voters.
“We are putting potentially an undue burden on voters to hang on to their ability to vote,” Chapman said.
Chapman’s greatest concern is about challenges based on voting histories in other states. Sometimes a person’s voter registration in their former state isn’t canceled due to administrative oversight or miscommunication between states.
“It assumes the voter intends to vote twice when in reality it could be an administrative error outside of their control,” Chapman said.
How challenges work
Based on the new rules, challengers must be registered to vote in the same county as the person they’re challenging on residency or out-of-state registration grounds, and must submit the challenge at least 90 days before an election. Challenges based on a person dying ahead of an election, being mentally incompetent or being imprisoned must be submitted by a South Dakota registered voter at least 30 days before an election.
A challenge to a voter’s residency must include evidence that the voter is not a South Dakota resident, based on state election law. The challenger must provide, under a sworn oath in front of a notary, one of the following:

A driver’s license or ID card issued by another state.
A resident hunting, fishing or trapping license issued by another state.
A postal change of address indicating the voter moved to another state.
State or county property records indicating ownership of a primary residence in another state.
Tax documents indicating the voter is a resident of another state.
A residency affidavit or certificate from another state.

A challenge to a voter’s out-of-state registration or voting history must include a voter file from an election official in that state documenting the claim. There is not a time parameter set for voting history evidence.
The challenged voter must fill out a “verification request” mailed to them by their county auditor within 30 days of the challenge, with evidence documenting their qualifications as a registered voter. 
Challenged voters can request a hearing and appeal decisions to the board of county commissioners or circuit court, but there is no appeals process for the challenger spelled out in the rules.
The county auditor must cancel the voter’s registration if the voter doesn’t respond with sufficient evidence. But the removal can’t happen within 90 days prior to an election, and only challenged voters who don’t cast a vote in the time between the challenge and the next general election can be removed. Auditors will notify the challenger and challenged voter of their decision.
If someone votes who is later determined to be ineligible, that can be challenged through the courts rather than the new challenge process, according to Hulse. She said the new process is designed to remove registered voters who are both ineligible and inactive.
“This process is more for folks who claim residency but aren’t participating in elections,” Hulse said, adding that such people can influence election district boundaries when they’re counted as registered voters.

U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson found that the inadvertent playing of an unredacted interview with Casada by FBI agents wasn’t enough to merit a new trial. Defense attorneys for Casada and Cothren claimed that the recording, which was mistakenly played in court, incriminated Cothren and prejudiced the jury in the four-week trial.
In a phone hearing Wednesday, Richardson determined that prosecutors made a mistake but that the defense’s request failed to meet a series of five factors for holding a new trial.
In FBI agents’ recording of their interview with Casada, the former House speaker said Cothren’s participation in Phoenix Solutions couldn’t be known because payments to the vendor wouldn’t have been approved. Cothren had left his legislative job amid a racist and sexist texting scandal.
Federal prosecutors brought up the fact that they played the wrong recording a day later, Richardson said, and defense attorneys didn’t catch the error when it happened. The judge also pointed out the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence that Cothren’s identity had to be kept secret for the plan to work.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Richardson threw out three convictions Tuesday against Casada and Cothren, saying prosecutors failed to prove they operated as agents of the government. Casada still faces 14 counts and Cothren 16 counts in the case.
Responding to defense attorneys’ requests for more time to prepare for sentencing in light of the three charges being thrown out, Richardson moved the sentencing hearing to Tuesday. It was initially set for Friday.

Attorney General James Uthmeier and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson say they’ve filed to reclassify xylazine, a controlled substance illegal to possess or sell in the state, to include an exemption for veterinarians to use the animal sedative. 
The drug, although originally developed for humans, is not recognized for human use but is often found cut into street drugs like fentanyl. 
“By providing an exemption for xylazine for this limited purpose, we are protecting access for legitimate veterinary use while keeping this dangerous substance out of the hands of drug dealers and abusers,” Uthmeier said in a social media post. 
Lawmakers and law enforcement officials have cracked down on the drug, making it less accessible.
The reclassification would allow only veterinarians to obtain the drug. Livestock producers would only be able to access the drug from veterinarians. 
Selling or intent to sell xylazine is a third degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.

Lawmakers proposed the veterinary exemption during the 2025 regular legislative session, although that bill did not pass.
The attorney general’s office did not respond to a Phoenix question as to how the reclassification would be implemented, considering drug schedules are enshrined in statute.
“The Florida Veterinary Medical Association (FVMA) supports the xylazine veterinary exemption proposed by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier,” the FVMA said to the Phoenix.
The group lobbied in favor of the bill that did not pass.
“The necessity and importance of the exemption is that it will enable veterinarians to have access to a critical, effective, and safe sedative when medically necessary evaluations, treatments, and surgical care are required for the health and welfare of animals. The FVMA has engaged in crucial efforts for this exemption due to our mission of advancing the veterinary medical profession, promoting animal health and well-being, and protecting public health.”
Dr. Kent Mathias, a psychiatrist and addiction-medicine doctor at the University of Florida, said people inadvertently take xylazine because those manufacturing street drugs cut the veterinary drug into it. 
“The whole goal of this, obviously, is to make the drug seem more powerful so they can get more money for it while putting less of the actual drug into,” Mathias said. 
The veterinary-to-street-drug trend is also seen with medetomidine, an anesthetic used for animals. 
“It seems that they are using the veterinary drugs because no one’s really looking for them at first and it’s hard to test for,” Mathias said. A common indicator people have injected Xylazine, Mathias said, is ulcers near the area the drug where the drug was administered, which he said can be “pretty severe.”
The drug cannot be reversed with naloxone, unlike opioids.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A special election to fill the Providence City Council’s vacant Ward 2 seat — which represents the Blackstone, College Hill, and Wayland neighborhoods — is set for Tuesday, Dec. 2. A primary date is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 4. 
The contest already has three contenders. The latest hopeful is Democratic pollster Matt McDermott, who announced his intent to enter the race Wednesday morning.
McDermott has served as national co-chair of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund Campaign Board and worked with candidates like U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who was elected in 2024 to become the first openly transgender person in Congress. 
David Caldwell Jr., president of the Audubon Society of RI, and Jeff Levy of the law firm Levy & Blackman LLP previously announced their candidacy. Both candidates are Democrats.
City charter rules triggered a special election for Ward 2 to fill the seat left by Helen Anthony, who resigned Sept. 1. Anthony’s resignation was OK’d by the Providence City Council at its Sept. 4 meeting, the first after the Council broke for its summer recess. 
Candidates must declare their intent to run by filing forms with the city’s Board of Canvassers between Sept. 25 and 4 p.m. on Sept. 26. Nomination papers go out on Oct. 2, and need to be returned by Oct. 7 with at least 50 signatures from eligible voters in Ward 2.
McDermott, who lives with his husband, a grade school teacher, in Wayland Square, calls for expanding affordable housing and returning schools to local control, after being under state control since 2019.
“Providence stands at a pivotal moment — a time when bold action can shape our future,” McDermott said in a Wednesday statement. “We need leaders who defend our values, build real collaboration, and deliver transparent, community-led governance.”
Caldwell’s website indicates that he shares the goals of returning schools to local control and creating more affordable housing. The Marine Corps veteran also wants to prioritize meeting Rhode Island’s Act on Climate goals and protecting the environment — a commitment he traces back to his deployment during the Iraq invasion.
“My most vivid memory during that deployment was standing on the Kuwaiti border as Saddam Hussein set the Rumaila oil fields ablaze, turning day into near-darkness,” Caldwell wrote. “Missiles occasionally flew overhead, intercepted by our Patriot batteries. In that moment, wearing a chemical weapons suit on the other side of the world, I made a promise: my children would never have to fight oil wars abroad.”
Caldwell moved with his wife from California to Rhode Island in 2008, then to the East Side in 2017 so his daughters could attend the Lincoln School, an all-girls college preparatory school. 
Levy’s website promises that he will “fight to protect our city from Trump.” Levy wrote that he wants to keep the capital city “welcoming, safe, and affordable,” and cited his pro bono work against election theft and volunteer work with the American Civil Liberties Union as proof he’ll bring “relentless advocacy” to City Hall.
“That means putting in the hard work to find fair and equitable solutions to the budget, schools, and housing — and being ready to fight back against the looming MAGA assault on our city,” Levy wrote. “I am ready to do both.”
Levy has lived with his family in Providence for 27 years and has coached the Fox Point East Side Little League.
Anthony announced her resignation Aug. 1, citing her continued recovery from severe injuries she sustained in a 2023 accident in a California state park while on vacation. Anthony was in a crosswalk when she was hit by an 82-year-old motorist who mistakenly hit the gas on the large ATV she was driving. She had served on the council since 2019.
Anthony chaired the council’s Finance Committee, which is directly responsible for forging the capital city’s budget each year in concert with the mayor’s office. The committee on Tuesday night elected Councilor Jo-Ann Ryan, who represents Ward 5 and first took office in 2014, as the its chair. Ryan previously chaired the committee from 2019 to 2023.
“City Council has no greater responsibility than to be effective stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Ryan said in a statement Tuesday. “I intend to lead this committee with transparency and diligence as we work together to build a city that serves the best interests of all of its residents.”
During her first stint as chair, Ryan oversaw city budgets which were shaped by the allocation of more than $100 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding.

Jared Polis speaks at the Colorado Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is urging the state’s congressional delegation to support the extension of a tax credit for health insurance premiums before the end of the month, with one Republican congressman already on board.
The enhanced premium tax credit for people who buy their insurance through the individual marketplace was established through the Affordable Care Act and then expanded and extended during the Biden administration in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The creation, expansion and extension of the credit were all approved by Democrats when they had a majority in Congress.

It is set to expire this year under a Republican-led Congress, and experts warn that insurance premiums could skyrocket.
“Colorado has done everything we can at the state level to blunt the damage of H.R.1 and the loss of the tax credit, but only Congress can stop these massive premium increases and the resulting loss of coverage for hundreds of thousands of hard-working Coloradans and their families,” Polis, along with Lt. Gov. Dianna Primavera, wrote to the state’s 10-member congressional delegation in a Tuesday letter, referring to the massive federal spending and tax cut bill passed this summer.
Average premium increases for Coloradans who get their insurance on the marketplace will be 170%, Polis wrote, and people who live on the Western Slope will be hit hardest. The increases are expected to be 262% in Garfield County and more than 330% in Delta and Montrose counties.
U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the Western Slope counties in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, signed on last week to a bipartisan bill to extend the tax credit for one year. He is the only Colorado representative on it so far.
“Families in Colorado shouldn’t be faced with higher health care costs because Washington failed to act,” Hurd said in a statement. “Extending the Premium Tax Credit for another year gives Colorado families real stability while we work towards a permanent solution.”
The extension considered in the bill would punt the issue until after the 2026 midterm elections.
Polis did not explicitly state support of that bill in his letter, but urged an extension of the credit.
Colorado lawmakers passed a bill during the August special legislative session to inject up to $100 million to soften the premium increases. That money is dependent on the sale of insurance premium and corporate tax credits.
“Even with these steps at the state level, without congressional action to extend the tax credit, we project more than 75,000 Coloradans will still lose access to affordable health care in 2026, and rural communities will face premium increases of 300 percent or more,” Polis wrote.
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert responded “Absolutely agree!” to a social media post from U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, expressing opposition to a tax credit extension. The offices of U.S. Reps. Gabe Evans and Jeff Crank, the other Republicans in the delegation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge converted a temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction Wednesday in a case challenging the constitutionality of a new state law requiring Ten Commandments displays in Arkansas public schools. 
The order from U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks applies to the Conway School District, which was added as a defendant in the case last month. 
Seven families with religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed the original lawsuit in June against the four Northwest Arkansas schools their children attend — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale. The state also became a defendant in the case after the Arkansas attorney general’s office intervened. 
The plaintiffs argue their religious freedom rights are being infringed by Act 573 of 2025, which requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
Arkansas school district responses to Ten Commandments law mixed

Brooks issued a preliminary injunction on Aug. 4 to block the law, which took effect Aug. 5, from being enforced in those four districts. Attorneys for the plaintiffs were later allowed to add two families from the Conway School District, where Ten Commandments posters had been hung, as plaintiffs in the case. 
The Conway School District was also added as a defendant in the lawsuit. Brooks granted a temporary restraining order against the Central Arkansas district Aug. 28 and ordered all posters be removed from its schools by 5 p.m. the following day. Brooks converted the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction Wednesday. 
A temporary restraining order is a temporary injunction that may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
In Wednesday’s three-page order, Brooks denied a request from the state for the court to reconsider its prior issuance of the preliminary injunction because “the State offers neither new facts nor new law to support its request for reconsideration.”
The state also renewed its request to narrow the preliminary injunction to the specific classrooms currently occupied by child plaintiffs in Conway, according to court filings. 
“The court rejects this request for a ‘bubble injunction’ as infeasible, unworkable, and likely to cause further injury to Conway Plaintiffs’ religious rights,” Brooks wrote. 
The converted preliminary injunction will remain effective “until this matter is decided on the merits,” according to Wednesday’s order.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free.
Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week.
The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest change removes income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments.
The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of $13,000 on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states.
In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.
The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.
The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. Latinas in New Mexico led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said.
The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.
The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.
Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow told the Albuquerque Journal that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported.
But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.
“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/day-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 15:58:23.559383

Videos circulating on social media showed students scattering after a popping sound is heard and Kirk appears to be impacted by something. A suspect is in custody, according to a UVU alert sent to students, Deseret News reported.
“A single shot was fired on campus toward a visiting speaker. Police are investigating now, suspect in custody,” the UVU alert said.
President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!”

“Our thoughts are with Charlie, his loved ones, and everyone affected. Agents will be on the scene quickly and the FBI stands in full support of the ongoing response and investigation,” Patel said.
Kirk is a founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions and a close ally of the president. He was speaking at the university as part of his American Comeback tour.
On Capitol Hill, dozens of congressional Republicans offered prayers for Kirk, with whom many GOP members have personal relationships.
U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, paused the panel’s consideration of a bill and held a moment of silence after Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene informed the committee of the shooting.
Vice President JD Vance offered his own statement of support on X.
“Say a prayer for Charlie Kirk, a genuinely good guy and a young father,” he wrote.

Jolly leads Donalds, the Southwest Florida U.S. representative endorsed by Donald Trump, 41%-40%, with 19% undecided.
Renner leads Jolly, 42%-40%, with 18% undecided.
“This is more than just a number,” Jolly said in a post on X. “It’s a sign that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike have had enough of the chaos. It’s a sign that Floridians are ready for something better.”
The survey of 631 registered Florida voters was conducted by the Miami polling firm of Bendixen & Amandi International, with a margin for error of +/- 4.0%.
With the general election more than 13 months away, the survey revealed that a large portion of the electorate isn’t aware of who any of these candidates are.
Donalds does best in name recognition, with 50% saying they don’t know who he is. Renner is unknown to 57% of the public, while 62% said they didn’t know who Jolly is.
The survey also shows that 48% oppose a mid-decade redistricting of Florida’s congressional districts map, with 41% in support. Banning vaccine mandates is also a loser, with 60% opposing and just 37% supporting.
In a breakdown of the poll results, Bendixen & Amandi says that 43% of those who responded to the survey were Republicans, 34% Democrats, and 23% registered as non-party-affiliated (NPA) or with a third political party. That’s close to the political breakdown of the state by party registration, which now has Republicans with a 10-point lead over Democrats statewide.
A poll conducted by Victory Insights in June showed Donalds leading Jolly, 37%-31%, with 31% undecided.

(Photo courtesy of Kamiwan and Paul Oliver)A Calais couple is suing their town over its rules regarding backyard chickens that they claim could be unconstitutional. 
Kamiwan and Paul Oliver keep 19 chickens on their quarter-acre property that provide about a dozen eggs per day and meat to feed themselves and their three children. However, a town ordinance might prevent them from keeping the birds, which they argue would violate their right to food established in the Maine Constitution. 
“I have peace knowing that my family has eaten and will eat again tomorrow thanks to our flock of 19 chickens,” said Kamiwan, in a virtual news conference Wednesday morning. 
“Even with that peace, I have spent many sleepless nights worrying whether the city will attempt to enforce this unconstitutional ordinance upon us. We live in fear that since we do not and, sometimes, cannot comply with the many limitations of the ordinance that we will lose one of our main sources of food.”
In June 2024, the city of Calais adopted an ordinance that does not allow residents to keep more than six chickens per household. The ordinance also requires the birds to be kept on at least half an acre of land and coops must be at least 20 feet from an abutting property. There are also restrictions on where the coops can be on a lot. Existing coops that do not comply were not grandfathered.
The Olivers are being represented by the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, a national civil liberties law firm that represents people pro bono. 
The lawsuit, which was filed in the Washington County Superior Court, hinges on the right to food that was enshrined into the state constitution in 2021. The amendment to the state constitution, which was passed by voters, says Mainers have a “natural, inherent and unalienable right to . . . grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.”
“We are filing the suit today to ensure the Olivers can continue to use their property to provide for themselves without bothering anyone else,” said Nick DeBenedetto, a litigation fellow with the Institute for Justice working on this case. He added that the Olivers have never received a complaint about their flock.
The city has 21 days to respond now that the suit has been filed, DeBenedetto said. The city did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Maine was the first state in the country to guarantee a right to food, so the issue has sparse legal precedent, but its limits have been tested in court before. 
In 2022, another Maine couple filed a lawsuit that argued the state’s Sunday hunting ban was unconstitutional after the passage of the right to food amendment. However, the state’s highest court found that the Sunday ban does not violate the right to food because it falls under the poaching exception in the amendment. 
Earlier this year, the state also passed legislation that bars a county or municipality from adopting a regulation that prohibits a person from keeping chickens on their residential property. However, it also specifies that the new statute doesn’t limit home rule authority for the municipality. The new law doesn’t take effect until later this month. 
DeBenedetto said the new law was a factor in the timing of this lawsuit. He explained that the law prevents a town from outright banning residents from keeping chickens on their property, but it leaves room for reasonable regulations. 
However, he said, “that’s where the mischief lies in this case.”
The series of regulations in Calais don’t explicitly ban chickens, but he argued that “when taken together and when you look at the practical effect of the regulations they amount to a ban for Calais residents.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A federal judge in the U.S. Western District Court opined on Tuesday that Shenandoah County School Board’s decision to restore the moniker of Stonewall Jackson High School violated a group of students’ First Amendment rights, since it compelled them to promote a positive image of the Confederate general.
In siding with the students, U.S. Court Judge Michael F. Urbanski wrote that Jackson’s name “is expressive as a symbol of racial exclusion in public schools.”
In June 2024, the NAACP Virginia State Conference and five students enrolled in the school division filed a lawsuit alleging that the board’s decision to rename the school after the controversial Civil War era figure violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs want Confederate names, mascots and vestiges removed from the school, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)
Urbanski said that the board cannot force anyone to express a message, and that the students were being forced to convey a message endorsing Jackson by their school being renamed after him, and by wearing their school’s “Generals” apparel and being identified as “Stonewall Jackson Generals” during extracurricular activities. 
“By reinstating the name “Stonewall Jackson High School” and thereby compelling students to advance the School Board’s chosen message favoring “Stonewall Jackson” through the conduct of extracurricular activities rendered expressive by that name, the School Board has violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, against compelled speech,” Urbanski wrote.
Urbanski granted the students’ summary judgement, denied the school board’s counter motion and deferred a final judgment on the matter. A trial has been set for Dec. 8, 2025.
“The federal district court judge delivered a powerful victory for students, affirming that they cannot be obligated to promote the legacy of Stonewall Jackson—a symbol deeply associated with the Confederacy,” Marja Plater, senior counsel at one of the law firms representing the civil rights group and students, said in a statement Wednesday. “The court’s opinion makes it unmistakably clear: students deserve the freedom to define themselves unencumbered by symbols they do not choose.”
Li Reed, an attorney with Covington & Burling, which is also representing the plaintiffs, added that the decision is a “key vindication” of what their clients have argued since the reinstatement of the Confederate name was proposed by the school board, which students said amounted to “forcing them to constantly espouse pro-slavery, anti-Black messages is a violation of their First Amendment constitutional rights.” 
Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the NAACP Virginia State Conference, said the judge’s ruling “reinforces what we know to be true; those who led the Confederacy should not be honored.”
Virginia school board restores Confederate names

On May 10, 2024, the Shenandoah County School Board reversed a 2020 decision by a previous board to rename two schools bearing the names of Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in alignment with a nationwide effort to make schools more inclusive and equitable.
Some people, including a group of Shenandoah residents who support the school names’ reversal, believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union and their fight for states’ rights. Others, including civil rights groups and Shenandoah students and families who oppose the schools’ renaming, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism, and say modern use of Confederate symbols contributes to racial tensions.
Between the 1950s and 1960s, Shenandoah County officials named public schools after Confederate leaders.
The Mercury contacted the school board for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) told the New Mexico Finance Authority (NMFA) Oversight Committee, while the other half lives in Bernalillo, Santa Fe and Doña Ana counties.","Communities in New Mexico will be able to apply for state funding for solar projects and help finding other sources of funding by the end of the year, state officials told lawmakers on Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo via Getty Images)Local and tribal governments in New Mexico can expect to begin applying for state funding to support solar energy projects by the end of the year, state officials told lawmakers on Wednesday.
At the New Mexico Finance Authority (NMFA) Oversight Committee’s meeting in Deming, NMFA Deputy Director Fernando Martinez said applications for the newly created Local Solar Access Fund will open in early 2026 but the agency is hoping to have them ready by December.
The fund is a $20 million pot of public money for grants for solar energy and battery storage for tribal, rural and low-income schools, municipalities, counties, land grant communities and New Mexico’s seven regional Councils of Governments.
The projects supported by the fund are meant to reduce energy costs for low-income households and community service providers; support the local renewable energy workforce; enhance community resilience during emergencies; and leverage other funding sources, according to Martinez’s presentation to the committee.
The new law requires NMFA to provide project grants for designing and building solar systems, and help developers obtain state and local permits or apply for federal or other funding sources, the presentation states.
“We’ll be in the meantime building the applications internally so that we have a really good system so that when we open it up, it’s a really straightforward process, and we have a really good client experience for them, so it’s not too difficult,” Martinez said.
An advance copy of the proposed rule for funding decisions given to the committee on Wednesday also requires NMFA to work with the state Energy, Minerals, & Natural Resources Department to create minimum standards for proposed systems and metrics for applicants. Those metrics include capacity for the scope of work; project location; how much a project will contribute to a community’s “resilience;” and any other benefits that may result.
The new law requires most of the funding to benefit rural communities. The proposed rule specifies at least 60% of the money, approximately $10.8 million, be allocated to rural communities with a total county population of 60,000 or fewer people. No more than 25% of the money can go to any one county, the rule states, including the county government itself.
Half of New Mexico’s population lives in the 30 more rural counties, Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) told the committee, while the other half lives in Bernalillo, Santa Fe and Doña Ana counties.
“We don’t want to forget about either 50% of the population,” Cates said. “I appreciate that the drafters of this bill understand that rural communities are at a disadvantage and are giving them more than 50% of the opportunity for this program.”
The proposed rule sets a $16 million limit total for project grants and $2 million for technical assistance, leaving $2 million for NMFA to administer the program and cover any unexpected costs, NMFA spokesperson Lynn Taulbee told Source NM.
New Mexico’s implementation of new solar funding law comes as the federal government reverses the prior administration’s moves to boost renewable energy production.
A law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 gave developers tax and energy production credits for wind and solar projects, but President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” abruptly ended those credits in July.
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Then in August, the Trump administration clawed back $7 billion in grants for solar energy projects for low-income households from the same Biden-era law that would have benefitted 60 recipients, including EMNRD.
New Mexico also has a different program for businesses and low-income households to receive energy from solar farms.
During the presentation, NMFA CEO Marquita Russel noted that both the NMFA and the legislative oversight committee will need to approve the Local Solar Access Fund’s rules by November. Once initially approved, the committee will have to sign off on any future changes, she said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Supreme Court tossed out a lawsuit challenging a gubernatorial executive order that ends remote work for state employees.
The high court issued an 8-1 ruling on Tuesday that found state Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, did not have standing to sue because he was not directly impacted by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s order that state employees return to in-person work. 
Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, in February sued Stitt, arguing the Republican governor didn’t have the power to unilaterally mandate a return to the office, and it was instead the responsibility of the Legislature. 
Fugate did not have legal standing to seek relief from the courts as he did not have a “personal stake” in the outcome, Chief Justice Dustin Rowe wrote in the majority opinion. 
“Representative Fugate has failed to demonstrate that he – in his official capacity – has suffered an injury in fact,” Rowe wrote. “Representative Fugate has not seen his votes affected by the Executive Order, nor can Representative Fugate successfully demonstrate the Executive Order usurps legislative power.”
Rowe referenced the Oklahoma Emergency Management Act of 2003 which gives the governor power to assume “direct operational control” over the emergency management functions in Oklahoma and “empowers” whoever holds the office to “make, amend, and rescind” the necessary orders and rules to carry out the Act. 
In March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stitt authorized remote work that “balances the safety and welfare of state employees with the critical services they provide.”
In December, Stitt issued an executive order requiring all state employees to end remote work by Feb. 1. Fugate’s initial lawsuit was filed in late February. 
An Oklahoma County judge dismissed the lawsuit in March, but Fugate appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Stitt celebrated the Supreme Court’s ruling Wednesday in a statement. 
“Rep. Fugate spent months trying to stand in the way of common sense,” he said. “Taxpayers deserve to know their public servants are back at work, delivering the services they pay for and not hiding behind Zoom calls.”
Fugate said in a statement that Stitt’s claims that the court “backed” his order are false, and the Supreme Court’s order was focused on Fugate’s lack of standing to challenge the executive order. 
“As with much of his leadership, this is more theater than substance,” he said. “Nearly 10,000 state employees continue to work remotely.” 
Justice Douglas Combs was the only dissenting vote. He said he would send the case back to the district court for further litigation on the merits of Fugate’s claims. 
He wrote that the Oklahoma Constitution requires lawmakers to pass a balanced budget and Stitt’s “unilateral policy-making actions” requires the Legislature to appropriate funds for a return-to-work policy. Combs wrote that this is evidence of Fugate’s “personal injury” in this lawsuit.

Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican, on Jan. 14, 2025, at a committee meeting at the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ request to ban candy and soft drinks from being purchased with food assistance dollars has yet to be approved, while other states’ similar restrictions are expected to go into effect Jan. 1.
Lawmakers say the goal of the ban is to reduce obesity rates and risks by eliminating the option to buy soft drinks and candy for a specific demographic — low-income families receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Republican lawmakers at a Tuesday meeting of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency were anxious to see Kansas’ request for restrictions approved.
But Carla Whiteside-Hicks, the economic and employment services director for the Kansas Department for Children and Families, described during the committee meeting certain roadblocks.
Among them, she said, Kansas’ process is different from the process in other states. It’s more complex, she said, largely because of the nebulous definitions of soft drinks and candy in a new state law.
Bans of varying severity have been approved and are expected to go into effect on the first of the year in Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia. Some states restrict soft drinks, soda, candy or energy drinks, or a combination of the four.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chair of the committee, argued other states’ bans aren’t inherently simpler than the one in Kansas. Nevertheless, the definitions are important, she said.
“It sounds simple when we say pop and candy, but we know those details, those definitions matter,” she said
The state sent an initial request for the restriction to the U.S.Department of Agriculture on April 2. The proposal for a ban began as a bill, which passed both chambers during the 2025 legislative session but was vetoed on April 4 by Gov. Laura Kelly, who called it “simply wrong” and expressed concern for the law’s potential to hurt Kansas families and businesses. Instead of fully overriding the veto, Republican lawmakers inserted the policy into the state budget.
The provision withheld $1.8 million designated for a summertime food assistance program for families with school-age children. The provision required the secretary for the Kansas Department for Children and Families to request the restriction on candy and soft drinks before the department could access the funds.
Sen. Doug Shane, a Louisburg Republican, said during the meeting he didn’t understand why complexity was holding up Kansas’ request.
“And is there not any kind of national guidance considering this was part of a national policy agenda?” Shane said.
Kansas’ request is specific to Kansas statute and must work within the bounds of state law, Whiteside-Hicks said.
Upon first submitting the request to the USDA, Whiteside-Hicks said, she immediately assembled an internal team to guide the process of implementing the restrictions and measure their effectiveness.
“It was quickly evident that we do not have internal capacity to meet all of the requirements of having our waiver request approved,” she said.
No one on her team had the skillset to create an evaluation plan, she said, so the agency is soliciting proposals from third parties to do the work instead.
In Kansas, a monthly average of nearly 187,000 people in more than 93,500 households receive food assistance benefits. The average monthly benefit per household is around $452, according to USDA data from fiscal year 2023.
It isn’t clear how much it will cost to develop the new restrictions. Typically, the agency would undergo an analysis before submitting a restriction request to the federal government, but that didn’t happen this time, Whiteside-Hicks said.

California and New York could become the first states to establish rules aiming to prevent the most advanced, large-scale artificial intelligence models — known as frontier AI models — from causing catastrophic harm involving dozens of casualties or billion-dollar damages.
The bill in California, which passed the state Senate earlier this year, would require large developers of frontier AI systems to implement and disclose certain safety protocols used by the company to mitigate the risk of incidents contributing to the deaths of 50 or more people or damages amounting to more than $1 billion.
The bill, which is under consideration in the state Assembly, would also require developers to create a frontier AI framework that includes best practices for using the models. Developers would have to publish a transparency report that discloses the risk assessments used while developing the model. 
In June, New York state lawmakers approved a similar measure; Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has until the end of the year to decide whether to  sign it into law.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

Under the measure, before deploying a frontier AI model, large developers would be required to implement a safety policy to prevent the risk of critical harm — including the death or serious injury of more than 100 people or at least $1 billion in damages — caused or enabled by a frontier model through the creation or use of large-scale weapons systems or through AI committing criminal acts.  
Frontier AI models are large-scale systems that exist at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. These models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-5, Google’s Gemini Ultra and others, are highly advanced and can perform a wide range of tasks by processing substantial amounts of data. These powerful models also have the potential to cause catastrophic harm. 
California legislators last year attempted to pass stricter regulations on large developers to prevent the catastrophic harms of AI, but Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill. He said in his veto message that it would apply “stringent standards to even the most basic functions” of large AI systems. He wrote that small models could be “equally or even more dangerous” and worried about the bill curtailing innovation.
Over the following year, the Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models wrote and published its report on how to approach frontier AI policy. The report emphasized the importance of empirical research, policy analyses and balance between the technology’s benefits and risks.
Tech developers and industry groups have opposed the bills in both states. Paul Lekas, the senior vice president of global public policy at the Software & Information Industry Association, wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline that California’s measure, while intended to promote responsible AI development, “is not the way to advance this goal, build trust in AI systems, and support consumer protection.”
The bill would create “an overly prescriptive and burdensome framework that risks stifling frontier model development without adequately improving safety,” he said, the same problems that led to last year’s veto. “The bill remains untethered to measurable standards, and its vague disclosure and reporting mandates create a new layer of operational burdens.”
NetChoice, a trade association of online businesses including Amazon, Google and Meta, sent a letter to Hochul in June, urging the governor to veto New York’s proposed legislation. 
“While the goal of ensuring the safe development of artificial intelligence is laudable, this legislation is constructed in a way that would unfortunately undermine its very purpose, harming innovation, economic competitiveness, and the development of solutions to some of our most pressing problems, without effectively improving public safety,” wrote Patrick Hedger, the director of policy at NetChoice.

Gov. Josh Stein signed an executive order Wednesday relaunching the Interagency Council for Coordinating Homelessness Programs, a multi-agency effort to prevent and end homelessness by strengthening coordination among partners across government and private and non-profit service providers and advocates. 
The Council for Homelessness Programs will be co-chaired by N.C. Department of Health and Human Services Policy Director Karen Wade and N.C. Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Chief of Staff Jessica Whichard, Stein’s office announced in a news release.
Stein said everyone benefits when people have a safe place to call home.
“Right now, we do not have enough homes, and the homes we have cost too much,” Stein said. “Cost is a major cause of homelessness and a major barrier when people are trying to return to housing. I am proud to relaunch this council to prevent homelessness and increase the development of affordable housing of all types so that every North Carolinian can thrive.”
A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that North Carolina has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
The Council for Homelessness Programs was first created under the Cooper administration. It advises the governor, state agencies and external partners on issues related to housing stabilization, services for people who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and strategies to reduce and end homelessness.
“North Carolinians experiencing homelessness face challenges when trying to access physical and mental health care and treatment for substance use disorder,” Wade said. “I am proud to co-chair this council and work with partners to ensure people receive the care they need in their journey to secure housing and live a healthy life.”
More than 11,500 North Carolinians experienced homelessness in 2024, including more than 3,200 families with children, more than 500 unaccompanied homeless youth, and nearly 700 veterans, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That’s a 19 percent increase from the previous year.
“Estimates say that nearly 700 veterans in North Carolina are experiencing homelessness,” Whichard said. “I look forward to co-chairing this council, working to end veteran homelessness, and continuing North Carolina’s status as a great state for veterans and service members.”
Approximately 6,600 people were experiencing homelessness in the 39 Helene disaster-declared counties, according to the news release. That number increased as a result of Hurricane Helene. The Council for Homelessness Programs will include a focus on Helene recovery to help more people find safe, affordable housing, the news release said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3502-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 14:57:14.519600

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A North Dakota judge rejected a request from the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline to pause a free speech lawsuit filed against it overseas by the environmental group Greenpeace.
The Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International brought the case in response to Energy Transfer’s lawsuit accusing it of engaging in conspiracy, defamation and other crimes to stop the pipeline from being built. That lawsuit, pending in North Dakota district court, was also filed against two other Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund.
Greenpeace denies all of Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the pipeline company’s true motivation for bringing the suit is to punish and intimidate the activists who participated in the Indigenous-led protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and 2017. In this vein, Greenpeace International in early February counter-sued Energy Transfer in the Netherlands under a European Union directive that provides recourse to those targeted by frivolous lawsuits for exercising their free speech.
Pipeline developer asks North Dakota judge to halt Greenpeace lawsuit in Europe

Greenpeace International in the Dutch case accuses the energy company of abusing the legal system to waste its time and money and of making defamatory statements about the environmental group. It ultimately wants the Netherlands to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages.
The Dutch lawsuit was filed shortly before the North Dakota case against Greenpeace went to trial. After sitting through more than three weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses, a Morton County jury in March found the environmental group at fault for more than $660 million. 
Greenpeace has indicated it will appeal the decision if it’s allowed to stand, though Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion has yet to enter a judgment in the case.
Energy Transfer says that Greenpeace International’s lawsuit in the Netherlands is an unlawful attempt to overturn its unfavorable ruling in North Dakota. It asked Gion in July to order that Greenpeace put the Dutch case on hold until its own lawsuit wraps up, arguing Greenpeace’s overseas litigation threatens to undermine the jury’s findings.
Gion on Tuesday denied the request.
He wrote that while the subject matter of the two lawsuits overlap, the fundamental legal claims they consider are different. For that reason, Gion said the Dutch case is not an attempt to relitigate the North Dakota lawsuit.
He also said it’s unlikely that the Netherlands court would act quickly enough to affect anything in the North Dakota case.
“Admittedly this court has no familiarity with the civil procedure in the Netherlands, and therefore, no idea how quickly the Dutch court moves on civil matters,” he added.
Gion has yet to enter a judgment following the jury’s verdict. Greenpeace has requested that he overturn the decision or reduce the $660 million award.
Gion wrote in his Tuesday opinion he expects to rule on those issues within the next week or so.
He also noted that attorneys for Energy Transfer previously indicated that if he did not halt the Dutch case, they may appeal his decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House Democrats are launching a multi-stop “Kitchen Table Tour” this week in an effort to connect with residents and discuss pressing issues before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
The tour will include 10 stops, starting with one in Huntington on Thursday. 
Between Sept. 15 and Nov. 3 there will be other stops in Martinsburg, Morgantown, Charleston, Fairmont, Wheeling, Gilbert, Lewisburg, Flatwoods and Beckley. Visit the House Democrat’s Facebook page for information on specific events. 
House Minority Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said in a statement that members want to connect with West Virginians from all political backgrounds and learn more about the issues they’re facing in their day-to-day lives.
“Our state, currently driven by the Republican supermajority’s pursuit of political power and propaganda, has left West Virginians behind,” Hornbuckle said. “The House Democrats want to connect with all corners of the state, all parties and all walks of life to have real conversations and focus on what’s truly important in our communities.”
Democrats currently hold nine out of 100 seats in the state House of Delegates while Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers.
Hornbuckle said, given the new state leadership under Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey, that it’s disappointing to see lawmakers not focus on matters of importance often voiced by residents, like “lowering their electric bill, good jobs, health care, education, affordable housing [and] clean drinking water.”
“Things have to change because West Virginians deserve better,” he said.
The Thursday event in Huntington will start at 6 p.m. at Huntington’s Kitchen, 911 Third Ave. Visit here to register.

Research shows that early math skills are more predictive of lifetime earnings than reading or health factors. And as Massachusetts’s economy increasingly relies on evolving STEM jobs, we must prepare all students — not just a privileged few — for that future.
The post Reading isn’t enough: Massachusetts must solve its math crisis, too  appeared first on Co[...]","Alarm bells are blaring across Massachusetts, and everyone from the governor to grassroots advocates is finally paying attention: Reading scores are in freefall, and the panic is palpable — and rightly so. But as state leaders mobilize to address the literacy crisis, they’re overlooking a parallel emergency that is just as urgent and damaging — a deepening math crisis that threatens our students’ futures and the state’s economic vitality.
You can see it in the data, yes. But you can also hear it, more viscerally, in the quiet despair of kitchen-table confessions from parents: Their child sits at a desk, math homework spread out before them, struggling to figure out how much Tayna will need for a 25% down payment on a $250,000 house. The child’s eyes glaze over, numbers blurring, as he mutters, “I am just not a math person” and walks away.
If you’ve worked in schools, parented a child, or remember your own struggles with math, this silent surrender likely feels familiar. But it should feel unacceptable.
In today’s world, math matters more than ever. Recent research shows that early math skills are more predictive of lifetime earnings than reading or health factors. And as Massachusetts’s economy increasingly relies on evolving STEM jobs, we must prepare all students — not just a privileged few — for that future.
Moreover, in an era when artificial intelligence is reshaping every corner of our society, the skills cultivated through rigorous math education – critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning – will be more valuable than ever. Math isn’t just about numbers; it teaches us how to break down complex problems, spot patterns, exercise sound judgment, and evaluate solutions. These cognitive tools aren’t “nice to haves.” They will define who thrives — and who falls behind — in an AI-driven future.
Massachusetts can’t afford to fall behind. And yet, we are.
While the Commonwealth prides itself on being a national leader in education, the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results paint a sobering picture: Math scores across the state have plummeted to levels not seen in over two decades, with only 37% of 8th graders scoring proficient or above on the NAEP math exam. But the real emergency lies beneath the averages. Among Black students, only 14% scored proficient or above on the 8th Grade NAEP exam. For Latino students, it’s 17%. For low-income students, just 16%. In some districts, fewer than one in five students are meeting grade-level expectations in math.
This isn’t just a hangover from the pandemic — it’s a widening divide that has reached a tipping point.  So how do we ensure students in Massachusetts don’t walk away from math — and their futures?
First, policymakers and education leaders must confront the math crisis with the same urgency they’ve shown towards literacy. The same forces driving the literacy crisis — weak curriculum oversight, inconsistent use of high-quality instructional materials, inadequate teacher preparation and professional development, and chronic underinvestment in student supports — are also fueling the decline in math.
Second, the state should require universal math screenings starting in elementary school. Massachusetts already mandates early literacy screenings to identify students at risk for reading difficulties. Why not do the same for math? These screenings can help educators intervene early with targeted support, rather than waiting until students are discouraged and disengaged.
Third, Massachusetts must make bold investments in high-quality math curricula and guarantee that every student—regardless of zip code—has access to rigorous coursework, starting with Algebra by 8th grade. Algebra by 8th grade is a powerful predictor of long-term academic success, math confidence, and college readiness. Yet, a recent statewide poll found that only 40% of parents reported that their child had access to Algebra I by 8th grade, with even lower access rates for students of color and those from low-income backgrounds. State and school leaders should prioritize access to advanced math courses, while districts should explore automatic enrollment policies to help close access gaps.
But high expectations alone aren’t enough. We must pair them with proven support strategies like high-dosage tutoring, especially in middle school, where the payoff is greatest. Research shows that tutoring—when done consistently—can dramatically improve math outcomes and rebuild student confidence.
Finally, we must change the message students hear about who math is for and why it matters. As Emily Marhan, a 7th-grade math teacher in New Bedford, shared in a recent blog post for EdTrust-Massachusetts, math success isn’t about being “naturally gifted.” It’s about mindset, persistence, and feeling safe enough to take risks. In her classroom, mistakes are welcome, and struggle is expected.
Every student in Massachusetts deserves that kind of math classroom — a place where they feel seen, capable, and included, and where math feels relevant and engaging. The path to improving math outcomes in Massachusetts starts with recognizing the crisis and committing to bold, systemic change, and it ends with belief: belief in our students, and belief in their ability to learn and thrive.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t think people were all that upset about winter utility bills judging by the crowd gathered Tuesday night before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
There were no signs, no shouting, and the dozen attendees fit easily in the rows of chairs — a stark contrast to the 200 people who spilled out from the commission’s Warwick offices at a public hearing six months earlier.
Joanne Rich, a Providence resident, acknowledged the crowd’s small size immediately. 
“I almost didn’t come because this one seemed particularly futile,” Rich said. “But I am here because I didn’t want you to think for a moment that the public, the general public, is indifferent.”
Customers, advocates and lawmakers continued to rail against Rhode Island Energy, accusing the utility provider of putting profits over working families. A 206-signature petition submitted to the commission ahead of Tuesday’s hearing urged regulators to reject proposed winter electric rates which would take effect Oct. 1. The rate hikes require final approval from the PUC.
“Countless Rhode Islanders are being pushed to the brink by unaffordable rates, even as utility company profits reach new highs,” the petition, submitted by social justice group the George Wiley Center, stated. “We refuse to stand by while our neighbors suffer. It is time for the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission to take decisive action to protect residents and ensure access to these vital services.” 
Electric supply rates typically increase every winter, reflecting the regular, seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. The proposed 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price, coupled with changes in charges for renewable energy programs and infrastructure and capital improvement, would increase the average residential customer’s monthly bill by 16.05%, or $22.28, over existing, summer prices. However, the proposed winter supply rate is nearly 10% less than last winter, and below the record high during the 2022-2023 winter.
Meanwhile, proposed changes to gas bills based on gas prices and company cost  recovery for operational expenses would cut annual bills by 10.3%, or $190.44 per year, for the average residential customer, starting Nov. 1.

Credits coming 
The projections do not yet account for extra bill credits mandated by the 2022 acquisition of the state utility operations from National Grid to PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company. Originally, the $154 million in electric and gas discounts was set to be distributed over 40 years. But faced with backlash over rising bills, including a state audit of accounting errors that resulted in overcharging certain customers, Rhode Island Energy executives hope to curry favor by giving a bigger discount sooner. 
At a rare July press conference to announce proposed winter rates — compared with the typical email notice — Greg Cornett, president of Rhode Island Energy, said the company plans to roll out monthly discounts starting in 2026. The discounts would slash electric bills $20 to $30 per month while cutting $40 to $50 from monthly gas bills, Cornett said.
The company has not submitted details of its requested credit distribution and schedule to utility regulators as of Wednesday morning, Todd Bianco, chief economic and policy analyst for the PUC, said in an email.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The annual monthly credit from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue was not immediately available.
Both bill credit proposals require separate approvals from state utility regulators.
The proposed mitigation measures did not dilute the fury directed at Rhode Island Energy, which reported a $183 million profit for the three-month period that ended June 30. Company executives and hired lobbyists warned against bills lawmakers introduced during the 2025 session that would have capped company profits while helping low-income, senior and ailing ratepayers with more time to pay overdue bills, or reducing total costs entirely.

‘I am all by myself’
Many critics of the proposed rate hikes reiterated support Tuesday for the Percentage of Income Payment Plan, a policy solution that already exists in a dozen other states that limits utility costs for the lowest-income residents.
“This failure is not natural or unavoidable,” Melissa Bubble, a community health worker, told regulators. “It’s a manmade failure.”
For Bubble, it’s personal. Rising rates make it harder for her to also pay for food for her children, she said.
Other ratepayers recounted the shock of having utilities abruptly shut off, or bundling in blankets, with the heat low and all appliances unplugged, to shave costs.
“It’s very hard for people like myself right now,” said Vrenely Espinosa, tearing up as she spoke. “I am all by myself.”
State law prevents the state utility supplier from boosting its bottom line through usage costs, which must directly reflect the price from third-party suppliers — a point reiterated by Brian Schuster, a company spokesperson, on Tuesday. And, state regulators cannot reject proposed seasonal rate increases as long as there is no evidence of extra profits for the company.
But, the PUC has control to limit spending on service charges, including capital investments, and can authorize policy changes. In March 2020, the commission ordered the utility operator — still owned by National Grid at the time — to give customers more time to pay overdue bills, with a lower upfront payment, before facing shutoffs. 
Rhode Island Energy is now seeking to suspend that pandemic-era requirement, which has more than doubled the debt owed by ratepayers, from $124.7 million in January 2022, to $254.9 million as of May 2025, according to written filings. If approved by state regulators, the extended payment plan would end Dec. 1, though customers already on the pandemic-era plan could remain so.
Roughly 2,700 Rhode Island Energy customers have taken advantage of extended repayment plans in 2024 and 2025, according to filings submitted to state regulators. Terminating their accounts could result in utility shutoffs for 5,000 residents, Troy Lange, an attorney representing the George Wiley Center, wrote in a June 30 letter to state regulators.
“It is critical that the Commission ensures Rhode Islanders are able to keep their utilities on, or restore service, as a matter of public safety, particularly as summer temperatures remain high and anomalous weather events—such as the heat wave which occurred the week of June 23, setting area temperature records for the month of June—occur with increasing frequency,” Lange wrote.

Feeling the strain
Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, implored regulators not to approve higher rates and end flexible debt repayment options simultaneously, noting the additional strains posed by the federal administration. 
“Times are incredibly tough, and so many people are struggling right now,” Tanzi said. “Rate increases and the change in repayment plans cannot happen simultaneously. I am not in favor of either of them, but my god, do not do them concurrently.”
Federal workers in her district have lost their jobs, while federal budget cuts are expected to reduce food assistance and government health care subsidies for thousands of Rhode Islanders. Meanwhile, the forced stop to the Revolution Wind project in late August — with 80% of the 65-turbine wind farm already complete — threatens to upend Rhode Island’s labor force and compromise climate change mandates while risking instability to the regional grid. Without it, the region’s ratepayers will pay up to $500 million more in annual supply costs per year starting in 2028, Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said last week.
Chris Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, deferred to Connecticut’s projections when asked for information about Rhode Island specific bill impacts on Wednesday.
Rhode Island Energy did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday about the local impacts of the stop work order on Revolution Wind. The company is separately in talks to buy additional wind power from another project planned off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, SouthCoast Wind. That project also remains uncertain under the Trump administration, and is still awaiting key federal permits.
The Public Utilities Commission will vote on proposed winter gas and electric rates, as well as the proposed termination of pandemic-era repayment flexibility, at separate meetings, none of which have been scheduled. 
The George Wiley Center is a recognized intervenor in the case, meaning it gets additional opportunities to speak and submit written filings to the commission during subsequent deliberations. The Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General was also recognized as an intervenor, but has not come out in opposition or support of the proposed rate changes. The AG’s office will be submitting its written testimony in the next few days, Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson, said Wednesday.
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates, which take effect Nov. 1, have not been announced. 
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

Feb. 5, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe ticking clock on the fiscal year is becoming frantic, and in a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday morning, the lead appropriator in the Michigan Senate said it would take courage and hard work to reach a deal with House Republicans on budget within the next few weeks.
Meanwhile, House Republicans said this week that they are no closer to an agreement with their Senate colleagues, and that it was time for the upper chamber to stop playing “chicken” with the already stalled budget negotiations.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) also said that she and her colleagues were doing their best to work with their colleagues in the House to avoid a protracted government shutdown, which is looking more likely as the days get closer to Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The situation has not gotten any better over the last few weeks when the leaders of the House and Senate met to start negotiating. Both the House and Senate said those conversations went nowhere.
Despite the Senate’s own inaction on a roads funding plan, which remains the sticking point in Michigan budget negotiations, Anthony on Wednesday continued to lay the blame at the doorstep of the House.
“Since the start of this legislative term, Speaker Matt Hall has failed to step up and act as a serious partner,” Anthony said. “Instead of coming to the table to negotiate a budget in good faith, he and his Republican colleagues have chosen to manufacture a crisis in attempts to push through an extreme agenda, putting politics and petty vendettas over the people we’re entrusted to serve. Budgets are about values, and the values reflected in the House Republican proposal are dangerous and destructive. I will always fight for a fair compromise, but I will never sign off on a plan that does so at the expense of hardworking Michiganders.”
Anthony was joined Wednesday by three of her Democratic colleagues: Sen. John Cherry of Flint, Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak and Sen. Sylvia Santana of Detroit.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

McMorrow said that when the budget negotiations began, chaos and a prolonged stalemate wasn’t initially in the cards.
She also touched on the House Republican assertion that it was cutting $750 million by eliminating so-called “phantom employees,” or jobs that have gone unfilled even though the previous budgets accounted for them. McMorrow said that the assertion that these positions were evidence of fraud shows a “stunning ignorance of basic budgeting, or it’s a deliberate attempt to mislead the public,”
“Any legislator worth their salt understands a full time equivalent does not mean a full time employee. One FTE does not equal one full time employee at a standard set salary,” McMorrow said. “Instead, a full time equivalent is a way to measure how much work the department can get done, including full time, part time and contract workers, whose pay ranges.”
McMorrow added that when the House talks of underfunded staffing while also expecting departments to maintain services, they’re not being fiscally responsible.
“You’re forcing agencies to cut corners and compromise the services that our citizens count on,” McMorrow said. “And now they’ve got Donald Trump baseless promoting this lie to throw red meat to the base. To Hall and House Republicans, these cuts may feel like some moral victory, but make no mistake, Michiganders feel the cuts to services, all in service of this lie.”
House Republicans to Senate Democrats: Stop playing chicken
Shutdown fears loom as the budget crisis continues. State Rep. Cam Cavitt (R-Cheboygan), accused the Senate Democrats of failing to negotiate now that the House has presented its budget in full, despite their apparent opposition to the priorities the House advanced.
“Senate Democrats are playing some sort of twisted game of chicken where they wait to negotiate until the very last minute,” Cavitt said in a statement issued earlier this week. “It’s sick. This isn’t a game. If we don’t get a bipartisan budget done by Oct. 1, critical services will shut down. Senate Democrats are going to close our schools just like they did during the COVID lockdowns.”
Cavitt also touched on the Senate’s lack of a roads plan, and how that is holding things up.
“House Republicans have a commonsense plan that doesn’t raise taxes. All we’re asking is that the Senate come to the table with their own commonsense plan that doesn’t raise taxes,” Cavitt said. “Senate Democrats are going to shut our state down because they care more about raising taxes than they do our schoolchildren and first responders.”
Anthony was asked on Wednesday if she felt a shutdown would last longer than it did the last time the state was at an impasse over funding in 2007 and 2009 – shutdowns that lasted mere hours because the Democratic House, Republican Senate and then Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm agreed to a short term temporary budget meant to cover spending over a few months until a new deal was reached.
The senator from Lansing said she was a legislative staffer when those shutdowns occurred. She said she remembered late nights and tough decision making. Anthony hoped to avoid that this time, or worse, a longer, month-long shutdown.
“There’s real lives behind these political antics, and that’s why … the fact that House Republicans have waited so long to engage, and wasted precious time for us to avoid a government shutdown, is completely unacceptable,” Anthony said. “I’m not looking forward to a shutdown. We are trying to make sure that we’re preventing that every step of the way, even today, we’re ready.”
That said, Hall and state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), have been waiting at the negotiating table for weeks now. In fact, on social media, he posted a picture of himself and Bollin waiting to negotiate on Aug. 28, two days after the House finally passed its budget.
“We’ve been sitting in the room ready to go all day,” Hall wrote on X. “This is not the way to get this done. I think they’re afraid because we know the budget so much better than they do.”

The return to school and break in summer routine can be stressful, especially for children who may already have mental health problems. At the same time, health care officials said, teachers and other school staff are now interacting with children and referring them for help. 
The number of kids with mental health needs in the emergency departments increases at the start of a new school year, as does the number of children visiting the state’s urgent crisis centers, officials said at the Wednesday press conference. 
“This is supposed to be a really exciting time. You have kids going back to school,” said Dr. Laine Taylor, chief medical officer at The Village for Families and Children. “What it is, really, is a transition for some kids that can be exciting, but for other kids that can be anxiety provoking, that can cause a lot of stress and kids to feel overwhelmed.”
Annually, about 1 in 5 children, or 2,500 kids, who visit the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center are found to be at risk for suicide, said Dr. Steven Rogers, a pediatric emergency medicine physician working on youth suicide prevention. During the summer, the hospital typically has a census of about 10 to 20 children with severe mental health needs, but that number can jump to 30 during the school year.
The medical center has launched a Youth Suicide Prevention Center to help screen and treat children for mental health needs.
Since the pandemic, Connecticut families have reported that their children have had more frequent occurrences of mental illness and that those symptoms are more severe. Last summer, the state saw a spike in youth suicides, and mental health service providers have reported that their resources are stretched thin.
In response to the heightened need for mental health care, the state legislature in 2022 approved a law that established urgent crisis centers that aim to treat children with emergency mental health needs and keep those kids out of the emergency department where possible.
The centers are located in Waterbury, Hartford, New London and New Haven.
Department of Children and Families interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said she’d seen the need in her work at the agency and that urgent crisis centers offer an avenue to “provide support and access in a way that is more immediately available and more tied to the individual needs and circumstances for the children and families involved.”
The programs have been successful in keeping kids in their homes during treatment rather than sending them for inpatient hospital care.
“They will take care of your child. It’s become our safe haven,” said Lisa Paradis, a parent whose daughter has gotten services at the crisis centers.
Medical professionals also said parents whose children are struggling should talk with them about their mental health needs.
Rogers said it’s best to ask questions directly of a child who might be struggling with suicidal ideation.
“Just asking direct questions is the best way to do that: ‘Are you having thoughts about suicide?,’” Rogers said. “Research haas shown that actually talking about suicide has prevented kids from dying.”
Parents with questions or concerns about their children’s mental health needs can also call 988, providers said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8542-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-09-10 14:57:14.519600

And looming over the debate are approaching deadlines for Missouri ballots to be finalized and candidates to file for office, along with promises of lawsuits — with any delays potentially undermining efforts to create a new Republican seat in time for the 2026 midterm elections.
The Missouri House passed a new map Tuesday that would carve up the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, and disperse its voters into three districts that give Republicans an electoral advantage in seven of the state’s eight congressional seats.
The fate of the proposed new map is now in the hands of the Missouri Senate, where the GOP holds a supermajority and is expected to pass it to Gov. Mike Kehoe for his signature this week.

At least two groups are considering a petition drive to force a referendum vote on the map once it is signed into law. If they successfully gather enough signatures, the map would be frozen until an up-or-down statewide vote is held next year.
“I expect a citizens referendum as soon as this passes the Senate,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat.
Jake Hummel, president of the Missouri AFL-CIO, said that while he hasn’t talked directly with his members about whether to initiate a referendum, “I have a pretty strong feeling they will.”
That referendum strategy was last deployed in 2018, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount required — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law.
In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
Protesters gather at the Missouri Capitol on Wednesday to denounce GOP efforts to gerrymander the state congressional map and make it harder to amend the state constitution (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Referendum elections are required to be held on the November general election ballot unless the legislature votes to move it to an earlier date. The timing of that vote would be crucial in determining whether a new map could even be finalized in time for congressional elections next year.
According to a letter from the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities that was sent to legislative leadership last month, every election in 2026 administratively begins 10 weeks prior to Election Day.
Elections are administered in the statewide voter registration database, which houses the district boundaries and voter district assignments currently in effect and ensures voters receive the right ballot on Election Day.
District boundary lines must be “locked” during an active election, the letter states, and voters cannot be assigned to a new district during this timeframe to ensure proper ballots can be created, proofed, ordered and printed in time for absentee voting to begin.
Under that timeline, the April 7, 2026, municipal election begins administratively on Jan. 27. The Aug. 4, 2026 primary election begins administratively on May 26.
That means, at least according to local election officials, if the congressional map being considered by the legislature isn’t finalized until after May 26, it wouldn’t apply to the August primary.
Meanwhile, the candidate filing period in Missouri for the August 2026 primary opens on Feb. 24 and ends March 31. In 2022, the filing period came and went without a new map in place as lawmakers quarrelled over boundary lines.
And numerous opponents of the gerrymandering push have promised litigation, arguing it is unconstitutional to redraw Missouri’s congressional map before the next census is complete.
The idea of forcing a gerrymandered congressional map onto the ballot for voters to decide was a recurring theme Wednesday as thousands gathered at the Missouri Capitol to denounce the Republican-backed effort.
The other target of Wednesday’s rally is legislation making its way through the legislature this week that would make it virtually impossible to amend the state constitution through the initiative petition process.
If that bill clears the Senate, it automatically goes to the statewide ballot next year.
Voters, Aune said, will have the last word on both proposals.
“(Republicans) may not feel like they have to answer to us here in this building,” she said, “but they have to answer to each and every one of you.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

LUDLOW — Addiction specialist Melanie Gulde helped Phish singer and guitarist Trey Anastasio after his 2006 arrest for driving under the influence and drug possession. More recently, she teamed with him to open this town’s 46-bed Divided Sky Residential Recovery Program.
Gulde knows the singer for the Vermont-formed band isn’t the only person who needs some backup.
“Women recover from addictions differently and face more barriers to treatment, often leaving them feeling overwhelmed and discouraged,” she said.

That’s why the nonprofit retreat center is launching a new women’s scholarship fund to assist those dealing with substance use disorder.
“It is more than just financial aid,” Gulde said of a fund that’s already raised $300,000 toward its $500,000 goal. “It’s a statement that every woman is worthy of a sober life, and we are here to support them.”
Women are more likely than men to face traumatic life experiences that can lead to substance use disorder, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports. Yet because of a lack of money and support, they account for only one-third of admissions to recovery facilities.
Enter Divided Sky. Anastasio had become dependent on opioids after dental surgery before he began a court-mandated recovery program under Gulde, a licensed counselor who specializes in abstinence-based, 12-step work.
The musician went on to create a nonprofit foundation, collect more than $1 million through a 2020 series of online “Beacon Jams” concerts, and purchase Ludlow’s 18-acre Fox Run at Okemo property, which features a 20-room lodge with a commercial kitchen, meeting space and exercise facility.
“I started Divided Sky Foundation to offer people the same help that I was fortunate enough to receive,” Anastasio told Ludlow leaders during a 2021 review hearing. “I’ve talked to a lot of people in the incredible, progressive, forward-thinking Vermont recovery community and there’s one place that they all agree, and that’s that we don’t have enough beds.”

After some neighbors voiced concerns, Divided Sky dropped its plans to offer medical services and medication-assisted treatment to help with withdrawal (Vermont has three such providers: Recovery House in Wallingford, Sana at Stowe and Valley Vista in Bradford). Instead, it opened in 2023 as a “nonclinical program grounded in compassion, mindfulness and the 12 steps” for long-term wellness, according to its website.
The cost of a 30-day stay is listed at $7,500. Because Divided Sky isn’t a detox or rehab center but a next-step recovery retreat, it can’t bill Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance and instead relies on scholarships.
“We don’t turn people away for lack of funds,” said Gulde, who has welcomed 265 attendees in the past two years. “Our mentality is what do you have and let’s work together to get you in the door.”
Divided Sky is establishing the scholarship fund with the help of Tamara Holder, a women’s rights attorney and advocate who covered the cost of the program’s first female participant in 2023.
“I know it’s already working,” Holder said of the center’s efforts.
Several Phish fan groups are planning to collect money for the cause in advance of Anastasio performing a sold-out set of fifth-anniversary Beacon Jams concerts in November. The frontman has good words for the new fund.
“This program,” he said in a statement, “can give more women the chance to heal and start fresh.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A federal appeals court on Wednesday largely rejected a constitutional challenge to a 2022 New Jersey law that restricts where gun owners can take their firearms, upholding the state’s ban on guns in parks, beaches, casinos, bars, arenas, and other places deemed “sensitive.”
The lengthy and long-awaited ruling comes almost two years after the state’s attorneys appeared before a panel of U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges to defend the law from gun owners’ claims that its wide-ranging restrictions trample their Second Amendment right to bear arms wherever they go.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said he is “thrilled” by the ruling upholding “this critical public-safety law.”
“The court overwhelmingly agreed with us on almost the entirety of the law, and the very few provisions where it didn’t were, frankly, minor pieces of the statute,” Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor.
He added: “We’re really gratified that the court rejected the gun lobby’s arguments, and they have said that you have a constitutional right under the Second Amendment, but that right doesn’t give you unfettered ability to bring guns into these sensitive places where we know people congregate, where kids congregate, where people drink, where they’re agitated, where fights occur. And that ultimately will keep the public safe.”

The ruling was not a total win for the state, with the judges refusing to uphold a restriction on guns in private vehicles; a requirement that gun owners obtain $300,000 in liability insurance against potential injuries, death, or property damage; and the law’s diversion of $50 in gun permit fees to a fund that compensates crime victims.
The decision was also not unanimous.
Judge Cheryl Ann Krause, an Obama appointee, penned the decision, which Judge Cindy K. Chung, a Biden appointee, joined.
But Judge David J. Porter, a Trump appointee, issued an incendiary dissent accusing his colleagues of “selective reading and overreading of Supreme Court precedent, methodological mistakes, and anachronistic disdain for public carry (which) combine to generate constitutional error.”
Under the majority’s decision, Porter wrote, “most places of human interest in New Jersey and all of its public transportation network are now gun-free zones.” That violates people’s right to bear arms in public for self-defense, he wrote.
The ruling upholds the state’s ban on guns in most of the “sensitive places” legislators listed in the law, including: zoos, parks, beaches, playgrounds and recreational facilities, libraries, museums, places that serve alcohol, entertainment facilities, casinos, medical offices, public transit, within 100 feet of public gatherings, and private homes and businesses not open to the public.
The judges also upheld the law’s requirement that permit applicants provide four references attesting to their good character.
The Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the law’s challengers, said in a statement its members are reviewing the decision “with our objective unchanged: to end New Jersey’s immoral and unconstitutional carry bans.”
“While today’s ruling offers a partial but important recognition of our position and acknowledges serious defects in the State’s laws, it does not go nearly far enough,” the statement read. “FPC remains committed to proving — when this case moves to final judgment — that these restrictions are an assault on peaceable people and must be struck down permanently.”
Scott Bach is executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, another group that challenged the law. He described the ruling as “a mixed decision that splits the baby on what is supposed to be a bedrock fundamental right.”
“It undermines the Constitutionally guaranteed right-to-carry, and this approach will ultimately wind up in the trash bin of history,” Bach said in a statement.
The group also specifically lamented the carry ban on public transportation, saying it blocks self-defense rights “in one of the areas where they are needed most.”
 Historic tradition

Much of the gun owners’ fight against the new law was rooted in a June 2022 landmark decision, known as Bruen, in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down New York’s requirement that gun owners show “proper cause” to obtain carry permits.
That decision toppled such requirements nationally, including in New Jersey, which had long barred most gun owners from taking their firearms outside their home or business unless they could prove they had a “justifiable need” to do so.
Bruen rooted its reasoning in the nation’s “historical tradition” of gun rights. In the majority’s 139-page ruling, Krause documented over dozens of pages the historical tradition of gun regulations going back more than five centuries to early England, and later colonial America, the nation’s founding, the antebellum period, and the Reconstruction era.
“Throughout our Nation’s history, the People have time and time again opted to limit the use of firearms at specific venues set aside for civic purposes, namely, governmental and democratic functions, and public places akin to the fairs and markets of old,” Krause wrote.
She added: “By imposing permitting requirements and restricting when and where firearms can be carried, our democratically elected leaders acknowledge that there are tradeoffs between the protections of the Second Amendment and fellow citizens’ enjoyment of functional government and a host of other constitutionally enshrined rights, including the right to speak, worship, protest, and vote.”
Krause seemed frustrated to be framing their consideration of the case in a historical context, noting that elected officials who have balanced gun-carry rights with public safety protections considered “modern circumstances, and the desires of the People today.”
“It is ironic that we, who are neither elected officials nor historians, may not consider that balancing but only the extent to which it resembles the balancing of legislatures in bygone eras,” Krause wrote. “Nevertheless, we have done our best to distill the principles of our Nation’s tradition of firearm regulation from the available historical record, and what we have found convinces us that New Jersey’s law, at least in part, continues that tradition.”
Krause noted that the world is far different than it was when colonial lawmakers wrote the Constitution. Firearm technology has advanced, population density has increased, and gun violence has risen and become more lethal, she wrote. Mass shootings now happen almost daily, she added.
“Our society has evolved considerably since the Nation’s earliest days. Many of the ‘general societal problem[s]’ that contemporary firearm regulations aim to address did not exist during the Founding and Reconstruction eras,” she wrote.
The legal fight dates back to December 2022, when Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law and gun owners almost immediately sued to block it.
A federal judge in Camden in early 2023 suspended many of the law’s provisions, but the appellate court quickly paused her injunction, pending appeal. That allowed the state to enforce much of the law, including the sensitive places restrictions.
Wednesday’s ruling clears the way for the state to continue enforcing the law. Platkin said he would issue guidance to law enforcement officers so that they’re clear on what the ruling means, and which restrictions remain in place and which do not.
If the gun owners press their cause further, the case ultimately could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, where a conservative majority rules.
Gun advocates instead should “just work to actually reduce gun violence in our state,” Platkin said.
But he’s not worried about the law’s fate if the legal battle continues, saying there’s “a clear historical practice supporting what the statute does, and we have shown that time and time again.”
“As you read through a very lengthy and detailed and I think very well-reasoned opinion, I think it shows that under the Bruen framework, these types of common-sense restrictions passed by a democratically elected legislature consistent with restrictions placed by democratically elected bodies for, in some cases, centuries, can continue to remain in effect,” Platkin said.

According to a news release on Tuesday, the state had 512 suicides in 2024, 42 more than in 2023.
Firearms factored into 60% of the suicide deaths in New Mexico. The health department provides free gun locks.
The new data coincides with National Suicide Prevention Month in September. “Suicide is preventable, but it requires all of us to act,” Clarie Miller, lead suicide prevention coordinator for NMDOH, said in a statement. “Whether it’s learning the warning signs, knowing how to connect someone to 988, or simply checking in on friends and family — every action matters.”
According to the 2024 data, white New Mexicans had the highest rate of suicide death (29.4 deaths per 100,000 residents); followed by American Indian Alaskan Native (26.2 deaths per 100,000 residents). In addition, the Hispanic suicide rate increased by 27% over the past 10 years.
The department in January reported that New Mexico’s suicide rates for women and Indigenous people had dropped steeply in 2023, and that the overall suicide rate for the state had dropped by 9% that year.
The national suicide hotline for LGBTQ+ youth shut down. States are scrambling to help.

According to a news release on Wednesday, the state had 512 suicides in 2024, 42 more than in 2023.
Health officials told Source NM the data is provisional and was calculated internally. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet issued 2024 suicide data.
Firearms factored into 60% of the suicide deaths in New Mexico, a data point that highlights “how many lives we could have saved with reduced access to lethal means,” Clairie Miller, the health department’s lead suicide prevention coordinator, told Source NM. “One huge misconception about suicide prevention is that if someone doesn’t have access to a firearm, they’ll just go die by suicide another way. That is not true; that is a myth. So by reducing access to lethal means, that gives us an opportunity, that provides hope, that gives us an opportunity for resources and to get this person the support that they need.”
The health department also provides free gun locks.

According to the 2024 data, white New Mexicans had the highest rate of suicide death (29.4 deaths per 100,000 residents); followed by American Indian Alaskan Native (26.2 deaths per 100,000 residents). In addition, the Hispanic suicide rate increased by 27% over the past 10 years.
The department in January reported that New Mexico’s suicide rates for women and Indigenous people had dropped steeply in 2023, and that the overall suicide rate for the state had dropped by 9% that year.
The new figures reset New Mexico at its 10-year average, Miller said. The state has mostly consistently ranked fifth in the nation, she said, adding that the top and bottom states for suicide tend to stay the same. The states with the lowest suicide rates tend to be at sea-level, while the ones with higher rates are at a higher elevation.
“Is that the determining factor?” she said. “Absolutely not. It can be a number of things, but studies have shown that behavioral health medications and physical health medication have a better effect at sea level.” While “there hasn’t been a lot of research done on this in about the last 10 years, I’m hoping that it picks that up again, because it is very promising at really showing us what we could do differently to support our communities.”
The new data released by the state Wednesday coincides with National Suicide Prevention Month in September.
“One thing that I think is really important, particularly in New Mexico, is cultural awareness when it comes to mental health and suicide prevention,” Miller said. “And the acknowledgement that throughout one’s lifespan, there is not a time that suicide isn’t an option. We can’t start thinking that our elders or our grandparents would never be thinking about suicide. We can’t think that our kiddos would never think about suicide. We have to acknowledge that throughout the lifespan, this is a potential, and there is not one time in our lives when we shouldn’t be talking about it.”

(Photo by Matt Rourke/The Associated Press)Two days after Gov. Ron DeSantis once again called on the Florida Legislature to allow the open carrying of firearms, a three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that the law banning open carry is unconstitutional.
“No historical tradition supports Florida’s Open Carry Ban,” Judge Stephanie Row wrote in the opinion, joined by judges Lori Rowe and M. Kemmerly Thomas.
“To the contrary, history confirms that the right to bear arms in public necessarily includes the right to do so openly. That is not to say that open carry is absolute or immune from reasonable regulation. But what the State may not do is extinguish the right altogether for ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens.”
Florida is one of just a handful of states that ban open carry, and the only conservative-leaning one. That’s angered Second Amendment enthusiasts, who have become frustrated that the GOP-led Legislature has refused to repeal the law, passed in 1987.
The case was brought by Stan McDaniels, a Republican candidate for Escambia County Commission who was arrested in downtown Pensacola on July 4, 2022, with a loaded handgun tucked into his pants using an inside-the-waistband holster.
According to a police report, McDaniels was waving at vehicles with one hand with a copy of the U.S. Constitution in the other hand when law enforcement officers arrested him.
At the time, McDaniels was reported to have been cooperative, saying that he wanted to take his case to the Supreme Court. Before trial, he moved to dismiss the charge and to have the open carry ban declared unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.
Following a hearing, the trial court denied his motion, but certified the question to the First District. McDaniels was convicted as charged and sentenced to probation and community service. The court stayed his sentence pending his appeal.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in a posting on social media that his office “fully supports the Court’s decision.”
“This is a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians,” he said. “As we’ve all witnessed over the last few days, our God-given right to self-defense is indispensable.”
“The Republican Party of Florida stands firm in defending our constitutional rights, and today’s decision underscores that commitment,” added Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, in a written statement. “The court made clear: Florida cannot extinguish the rights of ordinary, law-abiding citizens. We applaud this decision and stand with millions of Floridians in support of the Second Amendment.”
Senate resistance
Despite verbal support by DeSantis for the Legislature to repeal Florida’s ban on open carry, the Florida Senate in particular has proven resistant to such a change.
During the 2023 legislative session, then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo (R-Naples) said she didn’t support repealing the law because the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) didn’t want it.
Ben Albritton (R-Wauchula) succeeded Passidomo as Senate President last November. He also opposed a repeal, saying he didn’t want to cross the FSA. “I trust my law enforcement officials,” he said. “That’s where I stand.”
The Phoenix has reached out to the Florida Sheriffs Association for comment. We will update this story if we receive a response.

Amid a national gerrymandering frenzy, prominent Republicans have called for the party to take two or three more seats.
The offices of the Ohio House Speaker and Ohio Senate President announced the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, and a first meeting on Sept. 22, though the time and location of the meeting was not released in a press release on Wednesday.
Republican state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, and Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, were named as co-chairs of the committee.
The other members of the committee are:

House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood

Antonio released a statement saying the committee “now has the opportunity to seriously consider” the map legislative Democrats introduced on Tuesday under Senate Bill 259.
The Ohio General Assembly has until Sept. 30 to come up with a congressional district plan that receives 66% support in both chambers.
If the plan doesn’t have enough bipartisan support, the Ohio Redistricting Committee will be given the job of coming up with a plan.
Without bipartisan support in the committee, the legislature will have until Nov. 30 to adopt a plan with a simple majority.

A bill allowing Lyft and Uber drivers to unionize was sent to the governor’s desk  this week after it was tied to an insurance bill that benefits both companies. 


California ride-hailing drivers just won a crucial round in their pursuit of the right to unionize, but the political drama around the process and among the state’s drivers groups raises plenty of questions about what comes next.
Lawmakers sent Assembly Bill 1340 to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, but it’s merely a formality. The governor had already expressed support for the legislation in a deal he announced with Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas at the end of August. 
The state’s top politicians tied the unionization bill to Senate Bill 371, which is backed by Uber and Lyft and is also expected to pass this week. It drastically lowers the amount of uninsured and underinsured insurance coverage Uber and Lyft are required to provide, which they argue inflates costs for both drivers and passengers. In exchange, the ride-hailing giants dropped their opposition to the unionization bill.
Critics of the deal say it mostly benefits the ride-hailing companies, which in 2020 wrote and passed a ballot proposition to keep drivers classified as independent contractors. Both firms are likely to drive a hard bargain with a drivers union, experts say.
“I think it’s a sign of California politics that these large tech companies are literally getting their cake and eating it, too,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine who focuses on labor and inequality.
Uber called the deal a “compromise,” but a spokesperson would not answer CalMatters’ question about whether the company commits to bargaining in good faith if the drivers vote to form a union. Lyft also expressed support for the deal, but a spokesperson for the company would not comment on the unionization bill. 
There’s even more political intrigue surrounding the unionization bill: A new lawsuit filed by Rivas’s former press secretary, Cynthia Moreno, alleges Rivas made a deal with the Service Employees International Union over the unionization bill in exchange for its support for the state Democrats’ redistricting effort that will go before voters in November. 
Maya Polon, a spokesperson for SEIU California, said “the allegations are completely unfounded.” A spokesperson for Rivas said the speaker would not comment but sent a statement from Lia Lopez, chief administrative officer for Assembly rules: “This complaint is a total fabrication.”
The mention in the lawsuit aside, the political maneuvering surrounding the two bills and the dissent among drivers groups already present complications as California becomes the second state behind Massachusetts to allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize.
Consumer and labor groups opposed the insurance bill, which reduces the ride-hailing companies’ coverage requirement for crashes involving uninsured and underinsured motorists from $1 million to $60,000 per person and $300,000 per incident. They said it shifts the burden and potential remaining liability to consumers and possibly the state. 
Opponents of the bill had included the California Federation of Labor Unions. But when CalMatters asked Lorena Gonzalez, who leads the group, why she wanted the insurance bill tied to the unionization bill, she said only that her group “supports every effort to give more workers a voice on the job and a chance to collectively bargain.”
CalMatters also asked the same questions of McGuire and Rivas, as well as of Assemblymember Marc Berman, the Palo Alto Democrat who co-authored the unionization bill. They did not respond. 
State Sen. Chris Cabaldon, the Napa Democrat who authored the insurance bill, said through a spokesperson that he expects both bills to benefit drivers and riders: “My interest in carrying SB 371 was to lower fares for people who use rideshare for necessary transportation to their jobs, school, or medical appointments.” 
The governor’s office referred CalMatters to Newsom’s statement from Aug. 29, when he announced the deal tying the two pieces of legislation together. He said then: “Labor and industry sat down together, worked through their differences, and found common ground.”
The authors of both bills have received contributions from Uber, Lyft and the SEIU, according to state records.
Drivers groups at odds
Now that the state’s 800,000 drivers have gained those rights, they will need to choose a union to represent them. 
The SEIU, which sponsored the legislation, will likely become the drivers’ representative, thanks to late amendments to the bill. They include new requirements that make it tough for fledgling drivers unions to qualify to represent drivers. One of those requirements is experience negotiating union contracts. 
“This is so outrageous,” said Nicole Moore, president of Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United, adding that because the ride-hailing industry is fairly new, even a group like hers, which has been organizing drivers since 2018, does not have that experience. Moore said her group had supported the bill and been engaging with lawmakers as well. “They pulled the rug out from under us,” she said.
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who co-authored the bill, referred CalMatters to the SEIU.
Polon, of SEIU California, said: “The amendments are meant to ensure fake or corporate-sponsored unions are excluded, and that any organization which is representing these workers has the ability and expertise necessary to represent these workers.”
What could be next
Jaime Lopez said he thinks a union will help improve his pay and working conditions.
Lopez, 60, drives for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles. He was in Sacramento last week, rallying with other drivers ahead of the unionization bill’s passage. Lopez said he has been driving since 2015 and has seen his wages decline over the years. He added that he works seven days a week, doesn’t get paid when he’s sick and uses Medi-Cal for health care.  
“Maybe the union can do something about it,” he said. “I’m sure something’s going to change.”
But experts who examined the bill and its amendments are skeptical. 
“Real collective bargaining for gig drivers would mean a major shift in the business model of these companies,” said John Logan, professor and chairperson of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University. “Any improvement in conditions for gig drivers should be welcomed, but how much of a voice they’ll actually get is unclear,” Logan said. 
Dubal, the UC Irvine professor, has seen previous efforts to create what she calls “top-down company unions,” which she thinks is what’s happening here. She said language in the bill “creates a mechanism to get a single union to get dues (from drivers), plus money from the company.”
That language, says Polon of SEIU, allows drivers to negotiate “contributions or fees for a separate fund for the administration of benefits and services” including for representing drivers in cases of deactivation, or when they are kicked off the apps.
Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor at UC Santa Barbara who has written books about labor history, said sectoral bargaining — or negotiating as a group in a common occupation — makes sense for fast-food workers, for example. “It’s hard to organize McDonald’s franchises,” he said. “But this is different. Uber is a gigantic corporation with a lot of resources.” Because of that, he said a union should demand more for drivers. 
Lichtenstein did point out a provision of the legislation that he thinks will be positive: Ride-hailing companies will be required to share more concrete information about drivers, rides and earnings. There is often a wide gap between what the companies say drivers earn and what drivers and labor groups report about earnings.
“The release of data will put pressure on Uber and Lyft,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_Gig-Workers-Rally_LB3_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

That was the conclusion of a Big Blue Bug Solutions technician who spent over two-and-a-half hours last month inside the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) Providence headquarters searching for a flying intruder.
In the Aug. 23 service inspection report obtained by Rhode Island Current, technician Michael Brooks wrote that he checked cubicles, ceilings, staircases, and any where the winged mammal may still be hiding after being spotted the night before, just as contractors were set to seal the building. But the only evidence he found were two bat droppings on the windowsill of a corner office. Brooks noted a gap in the ceiling the bat could have reentered.
“At this time, it is likely that the bat made its way back into a void space through one of the various gaps around the beams and ceilings,” Brooks wrote.
It was the third reported sighting in August. The sightings added to a list of health and safety concerns from unionized workers who are urging state officials not to renew the DCYF’s 10-year lease for the converted factory building, which expires at the end of November. DCYF has already missed a key deadline to renew the lease for another 10 years.
One bat was seen Thursday, Aug. 14, and another on Sunday, Aug. 17, which led to the building being closed for a week while pest control technicians tried to deal with the situation.
That also meant a third $350 bill for building manager Ron Varone, who’s grown frustrated over having to deal with the repeated sightings and payments to pest control technicians.
“Every time they came, they charged my credit card,” he said in a phone interview. “Bats have been in every building in downtown Providence this summer — but for some reason it’s a big deal.”
Matthew Gunnip, president of SEIU Local 580, which represents about 300 of the 460 workers in the building, wrote an email to DCYF Deputy Personnel Administrator Cheryl Mammone the night of the Aug. 22  bat sighting 
“There are people who work at DCYF who have autoimmune diseases and you are making us return to work in an unsafe and unhealthy environment!” Gunnip wrote. “I thought the company secured the building?”
But since the Aug. 23 pest control visit, no bats or bat droppings have been seen within the five-story office building in Providence’s Jewelry District, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella confirmed in an email Tuesday afternoon.
Gunnip hasn’t heard of any unwanted flying visitors either. “It’s good news, but in the big scheme of things this bat stuff was a new and additional concern for us,” he said in an interview.
The State Properties Committee was set to consider and vote on a renewal of the office building’s lease on July 22, but the union’s pushback led the panel to pause the process while it awaited the results of an air quality test. The committee postponed another vote on July 29 in order to hold a public hearing that has yet to be scheduled as of Wednesday.
“I will let you know when it’s been scheduled,” Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, said in an email. She said the hearing would be scheduled  after normal business hours to ensure workers and DCYF administrators can equally have their say.
The lease terms required the state to sign a new lease by July 31 in order to extend it for another 10 years after it expires Nov. 30. At the July 29 meeting, the State Properties Committee members suggested that in the interim, DCYF officials could negotiate new terms with its landlord, New York-based Provident Property.
Francella said officials are in close contact with Provident Property but are unable to discuss a potential lease or its terms until a deal is approved by the State Properties Committee.
After the Aug. 22 bat sighting, Gunnip emailed Mammone a list of 40 questions ranging from concerns over use of cleaning chemicals, the last time the building’s HVAC was inspected, and perceived communication issues from state officials.
“Why did we not hear of the office closure until many of the employees we[re] already in the building?” Gunnip wrote. “Our health and safety does not seem to be prioritized.”
As of Tuesday, he said his email was still unanswered. Francella said officials are still collecting the information requested by the union.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s housing agency is quadrupling its original plans for the construction of new homes selling for far less than the state median price.
Then the agency wants to help families buy them.
The state Housing Finance and Development Authority had sought to boost the number of affordable homes on the market with a 30-house pilot program.
SC housing authority offers builders $10K per home to increase affordability

Thanks to $5 million allocated by the Legislature in the current budget, the agency now has enough for up to 130 homes, said Robert Macdonald, chief of staff at SC Housing.
“South Carolina is in a housing crisis, and this is our attempt to take a big swing at finding a solution,” said Todd Latiff, chairman of SC Housing’s governing board.
“We’re talking about people that have never had the opportunity to be homeowners having that chance,” he continued. “We’re talking about creating generational wealth for the South Carolinians that take advantage of this program. This is a big deal for our state.”
How it works
To do this, SC Housing is seeking builders willing to participate. The agency is asking construction firms to build either 1,000-square-foot homes with two bedrooms or 1,200-square-foot homes with three bedrooms. Both sizes must have two bathrooms.
The agency doesn’t put any requirements on the homes’ location. But it will give more weight to applications from builders spreading homes over more locations throughout a county or region, as opposed to a single neighborhood.
The homes must be priced at or below $175,000 for a two-bedroom and no more than $200,000 for a three-bedroom.
By comparison, the median listing price of a home in South Carolina is $350,000, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
But the cost can be much higher depending on the region. The most expensive area to buy a home is the southern part of Beaufort, where the median price in July for homes sold was $650,000, according to the latest report from the state Association of Realtors.
In exchange for the reduced price, SC Housing will subsidize the construction with a $12,500 payment to the homebuilder for each home constructed.
SC homebuyers can get up to $10K in state aid for a down payment

The head of the Home Builders Association of South Carolina, Mark Nix, reiterated that he’s glad to see the state experimenting with ways to make homes more affordable. And the agency has taken some of the association’s feedback into account since its initial proposal.
But Nix still cautions that the program might not be financially feasible for most builders in the state.
Land is expensive, and extra fees tacked on by many cities and counties add up. A lot of municipalities also have enacted strict requirements on how small they’ll allow lots to be for new home construction, Nix said.
“There’s no way you’re going to be able to build for that in a high-growth area of a major metro,” he said.
It’s more likely that construction companies will have to find land on the outskirts to make it work. Or cities will need to make concessions for builders of these projects.
The agency began taking applications from interested homebuilders Aug. 22. They have through the end of September. The agency will announce the chosen builders in October.
Adding to the affordability of the homes, SC Housing will provide eligible homebuyers with $25,000 in forgivable down payment.
To be eligible, a family’s annual income can’t exceed $127,200.
The state also will require buyers to take out a 30-year mortgage from one of the state housing authority’s participating lenders.
Record lending
Even before this new homeownership effort, SC Housing’s mortgage programs have been growing. They provide loans to buyers with low to moderate incomes at interest rates below the national average.
“We’ve all heard the real estate market slowing down. There’s a couple houses in my neighborhood that usually would have sold in 24 hours that have been on the market for a couple months now,” Macdonald said. “But our volume continues to increase.”
Macdonald estimates they’ll end the calendar year with about $400 million in total mortgage loans, up about 10% over last year.
“Our mission is to open doors, literally and figuratively,” said Richard Hutto, SC Housing’s executive director. “We are proud to be a reliable resource for South Carolinians who might otherwise be locked out of the housing market due to cost barriers or limited access to credit.”
Affordable rentals
In addition to home ownership, SC Housing also works to increase the availability of affordable rental housing across the Palmetto State. That’s largely through a pair of state and federal income tax incentives to developers willing to build apartment complexes with lower rental rates.
SC lays plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene

Last month, the state’s five-member fiscal oversight board chaired by Gov. Henry McMaster approved six projects: two new apartment complexes and improvements to four existing complexes. All must offer affordable rents for another 30 years.
The new complexes include 180 units west of Greenville and 76 units in northeast Columbia, on the site of an existing complex operated by the city’s housing authority.
The agency vets projects based on their financial viability as well as multiple other factors, including proximity to amenities such as pharmacies, health care, grocery stores, and schools, according to Lee Ann Watson, the agency’s attorney.
SC Housing expects to seek approval for about 10 more projects by February 2026, Watson said.
The agency’s ability to finance and offer tax credits for these projects is federally regulated.
In 2024, SC Housing had the capacity for 14 projects across the state — 11 new complexes and three renovated complexes with a total of about 950 units.
This is of particular importance because about half of all renters in the state spend more than 30% of their income on rent each month, according to a 2023 housing study by the agency.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/new-home-construction-1-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 13:57:23.402844

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Jamie Lucke)DANVILLE — The Kentucky Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about whether discussions of government business conducted via private cell phones are subject to the state’s open records law.
A lawyer for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Commission defended its refusal to comply with an open records request in 2021 for any text and email communications by private phones in which Fish and Wildlife commissioners discussed official business. 
The state Court of Appeals ruled against the department, saying that electronic communications about government business even on private phones are subject to the Open Records Act.
Excluding all text messages on personal cell phones, the appeals court said, “would surely operate to encourage the use of personal electronic devices and place vital public records beyond the reach of citizens” — a concern raised Wednesday by Justice Robert B. Conley.
Conley asked what would keep officials who want to avoid public scrutiny from “just doing public business on their phones” if such communications are, as Fish and Wildlife argues, exempt from the open records law.
Jan West, the attorney for Fish and Wildlife, said “that’s the issue” but said that is not what happened in the case before the court.
Justice Conley replied, “What’s to keep other people from down the road doing that?”

West said government agencies would have to advise officials and employees not to conduct government business on their private devices and provide them with government devices and accounts.
But attorney Michael Abate, representing the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, predicted “the destruction of transparency in the commonwealth” if some electronic communications about government business are no longer considered public records.
Abate likened the use of private cell phones to conduct government business to moving records from a government file cabinet to a file cabinet in a private home. They’re still public records, subject to the open records act, he said. 
In their questioning, the justices explored how technological advances have changed communication and expressed concerns about the privacy of personal devices.

Justice Angela McCormick Bisig suggested that text messages have become the “modern day water cooler.” 
West, the lawyer for Fish and Wildlife, raised the specter of governments being forced to comb through thousands of cell phone messages and the threat to individual privacy.
Abate disagreed with the water cooler analogy, saying that texting is “a way to communicate in writing.”
He also tried to soothe fears that private phones would be seized and searched in response to open records requests. Compliance with the open records law has always depended on individuals in government doing the right thing and responding in good faith to open records requests, Abate said. Also, the law has long shielded communications of a private or confidential nature from release under the open records law.
He stressed, however, that exempting texts from the open records act — by court ruling or legislative action — would invite officials to conduct public business outside public view.
Amicus briefs asking the court to overturn the Court of Appeals decision and rule in Fish and Wildlife’s favor were filed by the University of Kentucky and Attorney General Russell Coleman. Coleman’s brief was also on behalf of Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell, Auditor Allison Ball, Secretary of State Michael Adams and Treasurer Mark Metcalf.
The attorney general’s brief argues that the General Assembly has yet to set a standard for which records on a private device must be disclosed.
Abate said the 1976 open records law is expansive and has been interpreted to include evolving technology, including faxes, email and data bases.
He said the General Assembly has considered exempting text messages from the open records act but the proposals “failed largely because of public backlash.”
The Supreme Court is meeting Wednesday and Thursday at Centre College in Danville, where Centre students and students from nearby schools have been invited to observe.

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor on Wednesday recommended that state regulators deny AES Indiana’s request for a $193 million base rate increase — instead proposing a $21 million reduction in current rates.
The agency’s conclusions come after a three-month legal and technical review of testimony and exhibits in the pending case, which is before the powerful Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
Freshly appointed Counselor Abby Gray said AES “has not demonstrated sufficient evidence” for a hike, noting that the utility filed its ask less than 14 months after nabbing approval in a previous rate case.
“My team is recommending additional reductions that would reduce the utility’s current rates and help lessen the burden on ratepayers,” Gray continued, in a news release.
The OUCC on Tuesday filed testimony from 11 agency experts. The agency recommends that:

AES’s monthly customer service charge be cut from $17 to $11.25. The utility wants to raise it to $20.
The authorized return on equity be reduced from 9.9% to 8.5%. AES has asked for an increase to 10.7%.
More than 100 “phantom hires” in the utility’s budget be eliminated. AES wants to charge ratepayers to fill 105 open roles that one filing described as “continually vacant” with “costs that are consistently not incurred.”
Proposed expenses for depreciation, operations and maintenance be decreased and vegetation control costs be kept flat.

Electric Division Director Brian Latham — the lead witness — said AES’ case-in-chief “appears to simply give lip service to affordability while focusing on shareholder returns.” He noted that residential customers pay 25% more this year than in 2023.
AES’ rebuttal testimony is due Oct. 7.
Also included in the OUCC’s filings were more than 6,800 written comments from AES customers and other stakeholders.
AES Indiana takes next step to stop using coal, convert to natural gas by 2026

The agency has gotten “significant” numbers of written comments in recent rate cases for other investor-owned utilities, but “no recent individual rate case has produced as many as the OUCC has received in this docket,” External Affairs Specialist Ashley Bishop testified.
Another 89 AES customers spoke — all in opposition — of about 500 attendees to four public hearings held around Marion County, according to her filing. The OUCC also received about 870 complaints about AES.
“We received thousands of consumer comments in this case, highlighting serious hardships many customers are facing,” Gray said, “and I want to thank the individuals who took time to submit comments either in writing or at the IURC’s public hearings.”
Citizens Action Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for ratepayers, also filed testimony urging denial and calling for greater affordability.
“The Commission should take strong action to protect residential ratepayers experiencing inexcusably poor service at increasingly unaffordable rates,” Program Director Ben Inskeep said in a separate news release. They have “grown beyond exasperated with AES Indiana’s persistent billing and autopay issues, the woefully inadequate customer service, and overall response to AES Indiana’s mismanaged billing and autopay systems.”
After AES files its rebuttals, an IURC evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin Nov. 3. A final order is expected in the spring.

LANL will begin the venting of a radioactive gas on Sept. 13, 2025 after approval of the plan from New Mexico environment officials. (Courtesy of LANL)Los Alamos National Laboratory will start venting radioactive gas on Sept. 13 to release pressure from legacy waste containers, officials said Tuesday. The announcement followed  state environment officials’ approval of the plan on Monday.
Over the next two weeks, LANL aims to vent four waste containers filled with tritium and hazardous waste that it packed in 2007 and left at the lab’s legacy waste disposal site, called Area G. In 2016, a laboratory audit found the containers had been packed incorrectly and posed a threat of exploding.
Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear power and weapons. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin. Tritium is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water – when tritium replaces the hydrogen molecules in water.
New Mexico Environment Department’s conditional approval came after pressure from federal officials urging the state in a recent letter to finalize a decision and pushback from anti-nuclear and Indigenous groups about the proposal.
“The operation is scheduled to take place over a two-week period and avoids impacting neighboring Pueblo Feast Days,” LANL’s Tuesday notice stated. “It also considers weather conditions to ensure activities occur at the best and safest time possible.”
Tewa Women United and other groups raised concerns that the federal government based its tritium exposure levels of 10 millirem — a measure of radiation dose — on men, and did not take into account the impact on pregnant women and young children.
Based on those concerns, the state will require a “hard stop” limit at 6 millirem, versus LANL’s proposed limit of 8 millirem.
Chenoa Scippio (Navajo/Santa Clara), the environmental justice project coordinator at Tewa Women United, told Source NM the group is still concerned about the potential impacts for pregnant people, noting that tritium can pass through the placental barrier.
“When it comes to the knowledge that’s shared between the labs or the government and the community, it really puts the burden onto the community to research these things to find out what it does to the body to find out how it impacts the land and water,” Scippio said. “That’s not transparency.”
Scippio said people concerned about exposure should stay indoors during the weekend venting sessions.
“That’s really the best we can offer, which is unfortunate,” she said.
Representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state environment department will be onsite to view the venting process, officials told Source NM on Monday.

And then, a loud noise. Residents in nearby apartment buildings peered through windows and from balconies to find a dark-colored SUV bumped up against a moped lying on the ground. A dog walker called 911 to report the incident before it became apparent that the unmarked vehicle belonged to federal law enforcement, when men in U.S. Marshals flak vests exited.The rear driver-side tire on the Chevy Tahoe had completely blown and the Marshals struggled to find a jack and spare while a uniformed Washington Metropolitan Police Department officer stood guard.Bystanders pulled out phones to record and heckled. “Shame, shame, shame,” one repeatedly yelled. Another from a nearby apartment balcony screamed “Nazis!” Eyewitnesses began exchanging bits and pieces of what they said they saw, that the driver of the moped fled the scene.“He didn’t get away though, did he? He’s down there in custody,” a U.S. Marshal responded, gesturing to where the driver ran. The incident was like so many that have played out on the streets of Washington since Aug. 11, when President Donald Trump declared a federal crime emergency in the District of Columbia: A detainee is taken away by federal agents, often with local law enforcement standing by, and with little information provided to the public.On the night of Sept. 3, a States Newsroom reporter witnessed and recorded most of the incident at 14th and N streets NW. U.S. Marshals and Homeland Security Investigations agents detain a man at the intersection of 14th and N streets NW in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. (Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)  Earlier this summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and Marines to the streets of Los Angeles as his administration launched an immigration crackdown, muddling the messages on violent crime and immigration status. In recent days Trump has threatened to send National Guard troops to Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans, Portland and other Democratic-led cities. As of Monday, the administration announced a wave of federal immigration agents were headed to Chicago.“This is a big issue,” said Mike Fox, legal fellow for the Cato Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice.Fox, whose think tank advocates for limited federal government, told States Newsroom in an interview about Trump’s federalization of law enforcement in cities that he believes the strategy breaks down trust.“You have unidentified federal agents coming in, seizing people's property, but more importantly, seizing people. It undermines the very premise upon which community policing is supposed to work,” Fox said.Despite multiple inquiries, States Newsroom was not able to get any additional information on the man taken into custody.Moped drivers On the night of Sept. 3, as U.S. Marshals continued to struggle with the tire, Homeland Security Investigations agents arrived a short time later with a detainee in the back of a separate unmarked SUV. Eight Marshals and Homeland Security Investigations agents surrounded the man to switch his restraints to a new set with chains around his waist and between his ankles. HSI is a law enforcement agency within U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, under the Department of Homeland Security.News outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Bellingcat have reported on the detainments of moped drivers in the district, and publicly crowd-sourced alerts from online monitor “Stop ICE Alerts” have included sightings of federal agents stopping mopeds.

The 30-day federal crackdown has drawn widespread criticism and protests from district residents. District Mayor Muriel Bowser, however, has agreed to keep federal law enforcement on the streets beyond Trump’s emergency, which ends Wednesday.Moped drivers who run food deliveries are a routine sight on D.C. streets, and many are from Latin America. Until recently, it wasn’t uncommon to see groups of moped food delivery drivers along 14th Street NW before a day’s work or on breaks between orders.Law enforcement mumA States Newsroom reporter saw the man being taken into custody but his name and his citizenship or immigration status could not be determined, nor the reason why police chased him. Officers on the scene did not respond to shouted questions.The U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security Investigations have not provided information requested by States Newsroom regarding the incident, including whether the detainee was wanted on criminal charges or what happened to the moped that was left behind at the scene on a nearby sidewalk.U.S. Marshals are officers of the federal courts who usually apprehend fugitives and manage or sell seized assets. In January, Trump directed numerous federal law enforcement agencies, including the Marshals Service, to “investigate and apprehend illegal aliens.” States Newsroom has filed Freedom of Information Act requests with both agencies for body camera footage and reports about the incident and apparent impact between the SUV and moped, among other records.Similarly, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department did not provide information on the incident, despite its presence on the scene.When asked by States Newsroom if the agency made any records of assisting federal agents that night, MPD spokesperson Tom Lynch responded, “There is no publicly available document for this matter.”‘It should scare people across the country’Cato’s Fox said information on the federal crackdown in the district is scarce. “And that should scare everyone in D.C. It should scare Congress. It should scare people across the country. This is not a D.C.-specific issue,” Fox said. The American Civil Liberties Union’s D.C. Director Monica Hopkins told States Newsroom in a statement that “there are huge gaps and limitations in the accountability that is available to people” when it comes to federal law enforcement.“Despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, everyone in D.C. has rights, regardless of who they are and their immigration status,” Hopkins said.The ACLU-DC is urging Congress to pass legislation barring federal immigration authorities from wearing face coverings and obscuring their agencies or identification when engaged in enforcement actions.The Homeland Security Investigations agents and U.S. Marshals at the incident witnessed by States Newsroom did not have their faces covered and were wearing vests identifying their respective agencies.However, agents carrying out detainments in balaclava-style face coverings or bandanas and plain clothes, donning vests that only say “police,” have been witnessed and recorded by members of the public and journalists.Later that nightAs the scene wrapped up in Northwest D.C. on Sept. 3, immigrant advocates on bicycles arrived.The volunteers said they were with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid group, a network in the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area collecting information on immigration arrests and raids. The group runs a hotline for arrest reports and for family members seeking relatives who may have been detained.States Newsroom contacted the mutual aid organization but could not obtain any details about the Sept. 3 incident.Roughly an hour after police cleared that night, a States Newsroom reporter witnessed a small group of people surrounding the moped. A few tried to start the engine and removed at least one item from the under-seat storage compartment.The moped was no longer there the following morning.U.S. Marshals and the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to questions about the whereabouts of the moped.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-10 12:57:15.402796

Terry Murrell, who has served as Western Iowa Tech Community College’s president since 2011, will retire on May 15, 2026, according to a news release. He originally started at the Sioux City college in 2007 as vice president of instruction and student services.
“Serving alongside our faculty, staff, and students has been one of the greatest privileges of my career,” Murrell said in the release. “Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated milestones, and most importantly, made a meaningful difference in the lives of our students and the communities we serve.”

Murrell’s leadership has “left a lasting impact” on the community college and the region, the release stated, by enhancing both student success and the college’s presence in area communities and boosting partnerships.
During his time at the college, Murrell brought athletics to campus as well as a food pantry and health center, and strengthened mental health services, the release stated. Graduation rates tripled during his presidency and he helped the college craft new mission and value statements and branding.

He also took responsibility in 2024 for problems with its international education program, which led to the college settling in court with two groups of students from Brazil and Chile who alleged the college conspired with area companies to engage in human trafficking.
Western Iowa Tech paid a combined $5.3 million in two settlements after the college was accused of bringing in international students and pushing them to work at area meat packing plants, including plants run by Tur-Pak Foods and Royal Canin USA. The college then took money from students’ paychecks to reimburse itself for program costs, according to the lawsuits.
As the Iowa Capital Dispatch previously reported, Murrell said in July 2024 he and the college “got too deep into something we were not overly familiar with, and we didn’t do a good job.”
Western Iowa Tech will join other Iowa colleges in its search for a new president, including Des Moines Area Community College and Iowa State University. According to the release, the community college board of directors will share details of a transition plan as they develop, and will begin the new president selection process later this year.
“I am proud of what we have accomplished and know the college will continue to thrive in the years ahead,” Murrell said in the release. “It has been an honor to serve as president.”

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)The New Jersey Department of Health has authorized pharmacies and pediatricians statewide to give COVID-19 vaccines to anyone 6 months or older, a move meant to protect access to the shots after federal health officials last month announced new eligibility restrictions limiting them to people over 65 or with other health problems.
Acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown issued an executive directive Monday denouncing the “unfounded and unsupported barriers” the federal Food and Drug Administration created in rolling back vaccine access.
The feds’ restrictions are at odds with guidance from groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians, which have recommended widespread COVID-19 immunizations and endorsed their safety, Brown noted. Since the coronavirus outbreak began in 2020, COVID-19 vaccines typically have been available to anyone six months or older.
“This is about equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which has been proven to prevent serious illness and hospitalization,” Brown said in a statement. “Especially as we enter cold and flu season and as students head back to school, New Jerseyans are reminded to stay up to date on all recommended vaccinations.”
Novneet Sahu, the department’s deputy commissioner of public health services, also issued a standing order Monday authorizing pharmacists and other pharmacy staff to administer COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription to anyone 3 and older. Children under 3 can get immunizations from their pediatricians.
Gov. Phil Murphy said the orders are meant to ensure that anyone who wants a COVID-19 vaccine can get one in New Jersey. The administration also urged health insurance carriers to cover the shots’ costs free of charge to ensure widespread access.

From left, Rep. Vincent Dixie, Rep. Aftyn Behn, businessman Darden Copeland and Rep. Bo Mitchell.The four Democrats vying for a GOP-held Middle Tennessee congressional seat agreed that December’s special election was about serving as a check on the Trump administration.
But each one thought only they were the electable choice.
Primary voters will vote in a special election on Oct. 7 for the Tennessee 7th U.S. Congressional District triggered by the resignation of Mark Green.
On Tuesday, a coalition of progressive groups including TIRRC Votes, The Equity Alliance, The Central Labor Council and Planned Parenthood held a forum at Nashville’s First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, with businessman Darden Copeland and Nashville state Reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. 
Behn — who has been endorsed by Indivisible, a progressive political organizing group — said the only way a Democrat could win the seat was with energized turnout, which she could deliver by mobilizing voters with her progressive policies.
The 7th District’s primary election serves as the latest fight between the progressive wing of the party and moderate Democrats who vastly differ on how to win future elections.

Copeland, a first time candidate, said that whoever won the primary would face “a math problem,” mentioning he felt the need to run for the seat but didn’t specify how he would solve the problem. 
Since the district was redrawn in 2022, Green has defeated Democrats in back-to-back elections by 20%, with the Cook Political Report rating the seat as a “solid Republican.”
Dixie, a resident of the district’s North Nashville area, said winning the election would be about building a coalition and nominating someone who has lived the issues of the district.
Mitchell, a seven-term lawmaker from Dickson, said the race was about reaching out to rural voters, listening to them and convincing them to “quit voting against their self-interests.”
Few issues separate candidates from each other and Trump in Tennessee Congressional Debate

The district encompasses the western half of Middle Tennessee before taking a claw-like shape out of Nashville and Williamson County.
On the Republican side, nearly a dozen candidates are running for the nomination.
Americans for Prosperity Tennessee and SuperTalk 99.7 hosted a debate with Dickson state Rep. Jody Barrett, Brentwood state Rep. Gino Bulso, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, the four candidates polling highest in a recent survey by AFP Tennessee. Very few issues separated the GOP candidates, all agreeing that their job in Congress would be to support President Trump.
The general election is on December 2.

Tim Moore, a Republican from North Carolina's 14th District that includes parts of Charlotte, speaks on the U.S. House floor about the murder of Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail. (Screengrab of C-SPAN video)North Carolina’s 10 U.S. House Republicans are calling for the immediate removal of the magistrate who released a repeat offender charged with murdering a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte light rail.
The Aug. 22 attack has drawn national and international attention since Friday’s release of surveillance footage. It shows 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska getting on the train in Charlotte’s South End, sitting down, and minutes later, the man behind her standing up and stabbing her in the neck.
Police charged DeCarlos Brown Jr. with first-degree murder.
He had been free since January on a written promise to appear in court for a misdemeanor charge of misusing 911.
Multiple media outlets report Brown faced 14 prior charges dating back over a decade. He spent five years in prison for a 2014 robbery with a firearm. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Brown with causing death on a mass transportation system. Federal officials could seek the death penalty. The 34-year-old Brown will undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
“By releasing a repeat violent offender on nothing more than his written promise to appear, Magistrate [Teresa] Stokes displayed a willful failure to perform the duties of her office and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,” wrote the congressional representatives in a Sept. 9 letter.
“North Carolina’s justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” said U.S. Rep. Tim Moore of North Carolina’s 14th District which includes parts of Charlotte and its suburbs, such as Gastonia. “Judge Stokes had the chance to protect the public and chose not to. It’s clear that she’s unfit to hold this consequential position and should be removed from the bench immediately.”
The letter is addressed to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, who has the authority to initiate removal proceedings.
In addition to Moore, the letter is signed by Reps. Gregory F. Murphy, M.D. (NC-3), Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Addison P. McDowell (NC-6), David Rouzer (NC-7), Mark Harris (NC-8), Richard Hudson (NC-9), Pat Harrigan (NC-10), Chuck Edwards (NC-11), and Brad Knott (NC-13).
Moore has also co-sponsored legislation seeking to end cashless bail.
State Auditor Dave Boliek waded into the matter Tuesday announcing that the Office of the State Auditor will formally investigate the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS).
“The recent lawlessness and violence that have taken place on Charlotte’s public transportation raise serious questions about the security measures in place. We will investigate CATS and examine its public safety contracts and operations,” said Boliek.
The auditor’s office has notified Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Metropolitan Transit Commission leadership, and CATS leadership that the investigation will begin immediately.

President Donald Trump keyed in on the murder on social media Tuesday saying that the policies of Democrat-run cities have left criminals to pray on innocent people.
“We have to respond with force and strength. We have to be vicious just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand,” pledged Trump.
Figures show that homicides are down in many large cities since spiking in 2020 amid the pandemic.
Lyles, a Democrat, has called the attack on Zarutska “horrific and senseless.”
In response, the Charlotte mayor has pledged stronger policing across the transit system and increased fare enforcement.
Lyles is seeking a fifth term in office. On Tuesday night, she won a crowded Democratic primary with more than 70% of the ballots cast in the mayoral race. She did not address the media after her decisive win.
Lyles will face Republican Terrie Donovan and Libertarian Rob Yates in November.
Crime prevention and public safety will be top issues for the candidates.

Tim Walz speaks after the end of the special session in June Tuesday, June 10, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz made it clear he intends to run for an unprecedented third four-year term in front of a group of  100 or so Democratic donors Tuesday, according to two people who were there. 
In his speech at the Iron Ranger bar in St. Paul, Walz said something to the effect of “you’re all here making contributions, and you probably know I’m not going to run off to Mexico with your money, so look out for an announcement,” according to a source who attended the fundraiser and whose account was confirmed by another person there. 
“He made it clear he is moving in that direction,” said a person in attendance. 
The Reformer spoke to four people who were at the fundraiser or who have spoken to Walz about his plans in recent days. They were granted anonymity because they were not authorized by their employers to speak publicly.
Walz has also told several people privately but definitively that he will run again, and he will make a campaign announcement next week.
A Walz spokesman declined to comment. 
A DFL source who was at the event said Walz was thrown off by the June killing of Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was a friend and governing partner. But the recent mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, where schoolchildren were gathered for a celebratory Mass, “lit a fire in him” because he wants to provide leadership during another vulnerable moment in Minnesota history. 
Despite the advantages of incumbency, a robust fundraising operation and his own natural political skills, winning a third term won’t be easy. 
Walz would have to defend a lengthy record, during which he’s governed during some of the state’s worst crises: The pandemic and resulting academic declines; the murder of George Floyd and the uprising and rioting that followed; a spike in crime that has since subsided; emerging fiscal instability; and, finally, the political violence that took the life of Hortman and her husband Mark and badly wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. 
Another crisis has been state government’s own making: A wave of fraud in public programs is sure to be a centerpiece of the Republican campaign against him. 
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican candidate for governor from Maple Grove and currently chair of the Minnesota House’s fraud prevention committee, said Walz has allowed rampant fraud in his own agencies.
“A third Walz term would be a disaster, and I’m stepping up to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Robbins said in a statement to the Reformer. “I am committed to stopping the fraud, restoring fiscal responsibility and bringing back common-sense leadership so the state works for Minnesotans, not against them.”
Scott Jensen, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor, and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive, are also running as GOP candidates. Neither immediately responded to the Reformer’s requests for comment.
Recent polling suggests that Walz remains popular with Minnesotans, but they are less pleased with the idea of him running for a third term. A June KSTP poll found that only 43% of Minnesotans surveyed say he should run again.
Despite Walz’s challenges, he has also enjoyed the highest of highs: A surprisingly easy 2022 reelection and a Democratic-Farmer-Labor trifecta that resulted in a bevy of legislative victories, from free school meals to drivers licenses for undocumented people, legal marijuana to huge investments in transportation and housing. He parlayed that record and a few high-profile national media appearances to emerge as Kamala Harris’ surprising pick to be her vice presidential nominee. 
A national media and public speaking tour earlier this year fueled speculation about a 2028 presidential run, but he’s already said he won’t run if he wins a third term.

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Whether you have enjoyed a hike to a summit in the Green or White Mountains, fishing a cold-water trout stream, a postcard-perfect view from a highway overlook, or a glass of clean water from your tap, there’s a good chance that a U.S. Forest Service “Inventoried Roadless Area” is to thank.
But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”
Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20 percent of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36 percent say they somewhat approve, 15 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent strongly disapprove, and 11 percent said they were unsure. 
The post Healey holds her head above water in new poll  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","JUST OVER HALF of Massachusetts residents approve of the job Maura Healey is doing as governor – holding steady according to a new poll – but any challengers aligning themselves with Donald Trump will have to contend with the president’s persistent deep unpopularity in the Bay State. 
In a new poll for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – 1,000 Massachusetts residents weighed in on the state and federal executives between August 11 and 18. (Topline | Crosstabs) 
Asked how they thought Healey is doing as governor, 20 percent of residents said they strongly approve of her performance, 36 percent say they somewhat approve, 15 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent strongly disapprove, and 11 percent said they were unsure. The credibility interval is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
Most Massachusetts residents have an opinion on Trump’s performance, with only 4 percent unsure. And they’re more firmly opposed to the president’s actions. Some 48 percent of the respondents said they strongly disapprove, 12 percent somewhat disapprove, 18 percent somewhat approve, and 17 percent strongly approve.  
“Healey looks to me like a conventional Democrat,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling group. “She draws more cross-party support than Trump. Republicans don’t love her, but they also are not united against her the way Democrats oppose Trump.” 
Between Healey’s own base and enough independents, he said, it’s a “perfectly fine poll” for the incumbent. “It’s a long campaign with a lot to come,” he said. “But this poll on its own doesn’t feel like a warning sign.” 

Though the poll was fielded in August before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a series of moves that will limit who is eligible for COVID vaccines, Bay Staters were already holding Kennedy in generally low regard, though not quite as much as the president. The poll found 56 percent of residents disapproved of Kennedy’s performance and 34 percent approved. 
Healey last week announced that Massachusetts would chart a new path to break ties with the new federal vaccine policy.  
“The government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey said. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.” 
Predictably for this era of hyper-partisan and nationalized politics, party affiliation was the major indicator of approval or disapproval for state and federal leadership.  
Some 42 percent of registered Republicans and independents that lean Republican – groups that largely vote the same way – strongly support Trump’s performance, 39 percent somewhat support him, 9 percent somewhat disapprove, and just 6 percent strongly disapprove. 
The polarization was even sharper among Democrats. Only 6 percent of Massachusetts Democrats or independents that lean Democratic said they strongly supported the president’s performance. Three-quarters of the Democrats and leaners strongly oppose Trump’s performance. 
The firm majority of registered Republicans and leaners are chilly to Healey’s performance overall. But while 66 percent either strongly or somewhat disapprove of her, 27 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of her performance. 
The governor does still hold her Democratic base, with 80 percent of Democrats and leaners saying they approved of her performance. But that was somewhat softer support, split between strong approval and somewhat approving. Only 3 percent of the group said they strongly disapproved of Healey’s performance. 

Her overall numbers are still a far cry from her unusually popular predecessor, Charlie Baker, even as Trump’s first term sparked outrage in the Bay State. 
During Baker’s first run for governor, he was widely perceived as stridently partisan – a mismatch for the generally liberal Massachusetts electorate. But after toning down his pitch and winning a tight race against Attorney General Martha Coakley by less than 2 percentage points in 2014, Baker moved to the center with a Mr. Fix-It brand. 
In 2017, as midterms approached and the gubernatorial election was just a year away, Baker was viewed favorably by 67 percent of the state’s voters and held leads of at least 34 points against his three declared Democratic challengers. 
By the end of Baker’s term, his support came more from Democrats than Republicans, Koczela noted. “That’s a better formula for Baker,” he said, “since registered Republicans are such a small part of the electorate.” 
Healey’s election marked the return of one-party rule on Beacon Hill, and some political watchers mulled that there may be interest in rebalancing the state level partisan math if a strong candidate came along. 
Relatively little polling has tested out the odds of Healey’s Republican challengers, Brian Shortsleeve and Mike Kennealy, who both worked in the Baker administration and are currently criticizing each other over fundraising while going after Healey on shelter capacity, crime, and spending. A February UMass Amherst poll found Kennealy trailing Healey 40 percent to 15 percent, and Shortsleeve behind 44 percent to 12. 
“Donald Trump has a 35 percent approval rating,” Koczela noted. “Aligning with him could be helpful in winning a Republican primary but won’t help with the broader electorate. This has been the conundrum for GOP candidates in Massachusetts since Trump came on the scene.” 
In net approval – total approval minus total disapproval – Healey struggles with voters without college degrees and is barely above water with true independents and residents of Southeast Massachusetts. That region tends to be the hardest area for Democrats, Koczela said. 
Healey also seems to be a bit softer than a Democrat might like among non-white residents, which are generally reliable Democratic voters and with whom the poll shows Healey has net positives of 28 percentage points. Non-white voters in 2024 chose Kamala Harris over Trump in Massachusetts 73 percent to 25 percent, a 48-point margin. 
Though Massachusetts does not have exit polls during non-presidential years, Healey won cities and towns with heavily Latino populations by healthy margins in 2022. For instance, she won Fall River with 57 percent of the vote to Geoff Diehl’s 41 percent. 
“In 2024, Massachusetts saw a major realignment, particularly among Latino voters,” Koczela said. “This showed up in places like Lawrence, Fall River, and other Gateway Cities with Trump making major gains over past Republican candidates. Democrats would certainly hope for a strong performance among the state’s voters of color to show this was a one off, and this poll doesn’t clearly point in that direction.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — Railroads built Nebraska and helped usher in some of the state’s earliest economic benefits, ProRail Nebraska leader Bob Kuzelka told a group gathered Tuesday night at the town’s public library.
“And now they can do it again,” he said, advocating for expanded passenger rail in the state to increase transportation options and grow tourism and commercial development along rail routes. “At every stop, lots of people get on, people get off.”
Kuzelka was among a trio of speakers on the third leg of a five-stop town hall tour organized by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha and ProRail to educate Nebraskans on the possibilities and benefits of passenger rail options, gauge interest and broaden support. ProRail is associated with the Rail Passenger Association and seeks improved passenger rail and other forms of surface public transportation serving Nebraska.
The feedback the group and Juarez seek is for a legislative interim study also evaluating existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska. Juarez and other advocates say they recognize the cost and that resistance by some, including state officials, signals a tough road ahead for expanded passenger rail options.

The Nebraska Department of Transportation has told the Nebraska Examiner that passenger rail currently is “not viable in the state, because the development of such a route would pose a significant cost, and there is currently no mechanism to pay for such a project with existing state revenue.”
Speakers told the group of nearly 10 people at the North Platte Library that they hope the series of town halls will shed a positive light on passenger rail. A Lincoln town hall Friday drew about 60 people. The next one is at 6 p.m. Sept 16 at the Grand Island library.
Kuzelka and Dan Bilka of All Aboard Northwest said they hope public sentiment might nudge Nebraska officials to develop a new state rail plan they said hasn’t been updated in a couple of decades.
Bilka said a goal is for Nebraska and other states to become better connected through “true interconnected national rail system.” He and other speakers advocated for Nebraska to rejoin the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission (MIPRC) to promote that goal and not get left behind.
Nebraska helped establish the regional commission, but it withdrew years ago under a legislative proposal that said membership benefits “do not outweigh the expenditure of tax dollars on dues.”
State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island has introduced legislation to rejoin the commission. Juarez told the North Platte meeting she would attend a regional passenger rail conference later this week. She said that  even though Nebraska is not a member, she was invited to attend and plans to stay updated on the issues.

“We want to do more for getting Nebraskans on track,” said Kuzelka, sporting a shirt that says, “I’d rather be on the train.”
Bilka referred to the “three E’s” in laying out what he saw as benefits of passenger rail: economic, environmental and (especially for rural communities) equity. 
Though few in number, the group engaged with comments and questions. 
Tony Peal said he was retired and enjoyed trips on the Amtrak, which is the limited passenger rail service currently offered in Nebraska. The California Zephyr route stops in Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Holdrege and McCook on its way from Chicago to Emeryville, Calif. Nebraska stops are typically in late night early morning hours, not geared toward workers or a daily event.
But Peal called an expanded passenger rail system through other Nebraska towns such as North Platte a “pipe dream.” It would require use of Union Pacific Railroad tracks, he said, and he didn’t think the company would be involved or take on the liability.
He said he didn’t believe the population base in cities outside of Omaha and Lincoln could support the effort financially.
Macey Schroeder, 28, said she thought expanded passenger rail makes “just really common sense.”
The teacher said passenger rail was the “equity” that western Nebraska deserves. She envisions Nebraskans spending a 45-minute commute reading or working on computers instead of focusing full attention on driving a personal vehicle on a highway.
“Live your life instead of everyone having to drive themselves,” she said.

In addition to continued hiring in fiscal year 2026, plans call for a single hiring initiative in fiscal year 2027 that will feature 100 new attorneys.
The post Mass. public defender agency hires 22 new attorneys in rapid expansion appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","The Committee for Public Counsel Services has reached out to 50 law schools and hired 22 new attorneys over a 17-day span in August as it moves forward with “the largest staffing expansion in the agency’s history.”
In a mandated update filed with the Legislature, CPCS said the hires were scheduled to begin training Monday.
The Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey this summer agreed to a law requiring the CPCS Public Defender Division to hire 320 attorneys over two fiscal years. The law also granted raises to part-time bar advocate attorneys, and its passage came after some bar advocates stopped accepting cases to protest pay levels.
The supplemental budget signed by Healey included a $40 million reserve to help fund the hiring. The law also required that the hiring expansion prioritize efforts to ensure that clients are “timely represented by counsel” and directed the committee to prioritize hiring in areas “with unrepresented individuals awaiting counsel assignment, including counties with a recent history of private bar advocate work stoppages.”
Before the expansion mandate, CPCS had already hired 20 attorneys for its fall 2025 class, and the number rose to 42 with the recent additions. Nearly 80% of the expansion hires were assigned to represent indigent clients in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, according to the update, and CPCS reported that those two counties “are among the most impacted areas and where the need for counsel is most urgent.”
In addition to continued hiring in fiscal year 2026, plans call for a single hiring initiative in fiscal year 2027 that will feature 100 new attorneys and “will require a nationwide recruitment campaign targeting law schools and public interest networks across the country,” according to the update.
“This expansion represents a transformational investment in the public defense system,” CPCS said in its update. “It provides not only a significant number of additional attorneys but also the supervisory, investigative, and administrative infrastructure to sustain a modern and effective indigent defense practice. By structuring growth around proportional staffing ratios and investing in training, CPCS is helping to build a sustainable, system designed for long-term stability and long-term impact for the communities we serve.”

(Photo courtesy of Ash Hebert)Penobscot County is grappling with the largest HIV outbreak in Maine’s history. Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
 An HIV outbreak
The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.
 The future of harm reduction
Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

 Clearing encampments
Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
 ‘I’m still alive’
Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.

Ron DeSantis says he’s intent on pursuing a mid-decade congressional redistricting that would help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in 2026, the majority of Floridians do not agree — and that includes a majority of Republicans.

Ron DeSantis forced upon the Legislature following the 2020 Census. It eliminated Black representation in North Florida. (Via FloridaRedistricting.gov)Although Gov. Ron DeSantis says he’s intent on pursuing a mid-decade congressional redistricting that would help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in 2026, the majority of Floridians do not agree — and that includes a majority of Republicans.
The survey of nearly 500 Floridians of all political stripes conducted by Common Cause finds that 55% oppose the idea, with only 26% in support and  another 19% undecided.
The opposition is consistent across party lines: Among Republicans, 45% oppose the idea, with 36% supporting it and 18% having no opinion. Among political independents, 60% oppose the plan with just 14% supporting it. Among Democrats, 62% oppose the idea, with 25% supporting it.
“In very clear terms, our poll shows even Republicans in Florida do not support mid-decade redistricting,” said Amy Keith, Florida executive director of Common Cause, in a written statement. “Floridians do not want the legislature to waste their time and our taxpayer dollars trying to make our voting maps even more gerrymandered than they already are. The legislature should follow the data and stop their work on this issue. Floridians want them to focus on the real issues impacting our lives, like the cost of groceries, housing and insurance.”
Common Cause is a national watchdog organization with chapters in 35 states. It historically has supported independent redistricting, campaign finance laws, and stronger election safeguards.
Redistricting the state’s congressional map was never on DeSantis’ agenda throughout this year. That changed after Texas Republicans responded to a demand by the Justice Department to redraw their congressional map in early July. In doing so, they provided President Donald Trump with what he wanted — a mid-decade redrawing of district lines to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year.
That move motivated California Gov. Gavin Newsom to say that he would try to counter Texas and redraw his state’s congressional map (although that could only happen if state voters pause a state law establishing an independent commission). Governors in both blue and red states have since said they would consider redistricting.
DeSantis first took up the issue on July 24, when he said in Bradenton that he thought that the state was “malapportioned.”
“So, I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade?” he said. “So, we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you, just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five year period. It’s been really significant.”
DeSantis maintains that the state’s population was severely undercounted in the 2020 U.S. Census and that along with the changes in population (which in Florida includes many more registered Republicans than there were in 2020), the time is now to redraw congressional seats instead of waiting until 2032.
In response, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez (R-Miami) has created a select committee on congressional redistricting and named Rep. Mike Redondo (R-Miami) to chair it earlier this week. Senate President Ben Albritton (R-Wauchula) has not said whether he will create a similar committee.
Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate David Jolly argues Florida and every other state in the country should create an independent redistricting commission.  According to the Common Cause survey, an overwhelming majority of voters in Florida (76%) do, as well.
On Tuesday, the Missouri House of Representatives passed a new congressional map. That prompted Trump to write on social media that “this new Map will give the wonderful people of Missouri the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections. The Missouri Senate must pass this Map now, AS IS, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the ‘Show Me State,’ and across the Country.”
Common Cause commissioned Noble Predictive Insights to conduct the 499-person Florida poll between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. It has an error margin of +/- 4.39%.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In a Sept. 9 letter obtained by The Mercury, George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson informed Democratic leaders in the Virginia Senate that he will not step down from his post on the school’s governing board despite their request for him to do so.
Democrats asked Stimson to resign after the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, where he serves as a senior legal fellow, published a report titled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI,” that lawmakers said “targets” and “undermines” the institution and GMU President Gregory Washington. The Sept. 2 report was published as the institution navigates federal investigations focused on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to root out at universities in Virginia and nationwide.
Va. Senate Democrats call on George Mason rector to step down, alleging conflict of interest

Stimson wrote to top Senate Democrats that he appreciates their interest and partnership, but plans to remain on the board and continue to leave his personal views “at the door.” 
“I am completely committed to my continued service as Rector,” Stimson wrote. “The board is fully focused on our fiduciary duties to GMU and the commonwealth, securing the university’s funding and ensuring it continues to make all Virginians proud as a world-class academic institution. We will continue to serve the university and follow the law.”
The retired Naval officer with the Judge Advocate General Corps also said his scholarship on national security and crime policy at the Heritage Foundation has “no connection” to the foundation’s education policy work.
“Since my appointment to the Board of Visitors, I have made certain that I am fully walled off from Heritage’s work concerning education policy, especially GMU,” Stimson wrote. “I strongly reject the premise that any citizen of our commonwealth should be disqualified from public service simply because some elected officials may disagree with statements or articles attributed to other private individuals who happen to work for the same employer.” 
On Aug. 22, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights announced that George Mason University violated federal civil rights laws due to alleged unlawful hiring and promotion practices. Washington’s attorney pushed back against the claims, and the governing board stated that they wished to negotiate a resolution with the agency. Stimson’s letter to lawmakers’ didn’t reference the situation.
Feds claim GMU’s hiring practices violated civil rights law; GMU president’s attorney pushes back

The board is down to six voting members after the state Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected multiple appointments by Gov. Glenn Youngkin to GMU’s 16-member governing board. The governor is the only person with the authority to remove an appointment from a governing board, but the legislature has the power to confirm or reject the governor’s board appointees. The matter is now under review by the Virginia Supreme Court.
Stimson joined the board on July 1, 2023 after being confirmed by the General Assembly. He was elected leader of the board a year later, which included members appointed by the previous Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Stimson’s term ends June 30, 2027.  
The board has committee meetings scheduled for Wednesday, and the next board meeting is on Sept. 25.

Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) | Ken Coleman photo Former state Sen. Adam Hollier has long eyed a seat in Congress, but on Wednesday, the Michigan Democrat officially ended his bid for a Detroit-based congressional district and pivoted to a run at secretary of state.
Hollier now joins Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and Aghogho Edevbie, Michigan’s deputy secretary of state under Jocelyn Benson, in the battle for the party’s nomination in August.
As a former U.S. Army paratrooper who served as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s director of the Veterans Affairs Agency in 2023, Hollier said he’s ready for the next mission. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Our fundamental rights are under attack like never before. Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have put everything from free and fair elections to the right to vote on the chopping block” Hollier said in a statement. “As a U.S. Army Paratrooper, I’m trained to go where the challenge is greatest. As your Secretary of State, I will lead the fight against any assaults on our fundamental freedoms, and will never back down in the face of these undemocratic and unconstitutional attacks.”
A cornerstone of his new campaign would be a push to stop Republicans from rigging state and federal elections and silencing the voices of Michigan voters. He also pledged to remove barriers at the ballot box, boost turnout and make it easier to vote and cast a ballot early.
Hollier said he would invest in local clerks, giving them the resources they need to conduct fair and efficient elections.
One consideration for Hollier was whether to enter a leaner race with only two declared candidates, as opposed to the crowded potential field in the 13th Congressional District race. U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar currently represents the district, which is primarily seated in Detroit.
Hollier was one of 10 candidates in the Democratic primary for the seat in 2022, which led to Thanedar beating a slate of Black candidates, including Hollier, with just 28% of the vote. The race and Thaendar’s election has been criticized in Michigan because the packed ballot ended up working against Black candidates who may have had a better chance at getting elected with a smaller primary field.
The Democratic primary for the seat in Detroit is viewed as the race to win, as Democrats are typically elected in the general election against whomever the Republicans put up as a candidate.
Hollier, in a news release announcing his bid for secretary of state, specifically cited his wish to ensure that majority Black Detroit elects a Black member of Congress in the next round. Thanedar is again seeking reelection, and minus Hollier, already is facing three candidates in the Democratic primary – including state Rep. Donavan McKinney of Detroit.
Hollier’s announcement Wednesday also came with a long list of day-one supporters, including Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter, state representatives Joe Tate of Detroit and Peter Herzberg of Westland, and more than 30 local officials, former electeds and faith leaders.

The Small Business Innovation Research program — a funding pipeline that has supported countless scientific and medical breakthroughs that grow the economy and save lives — will expire on Sept. 30 unless Congress acts.
Here in South Dakota, the program is a lifeline for researchers working on next-generation cancer therapies, for startups developing tools to combat livestock diseases, and for communities hoping to attract high-paying, advanced manufacturing jobs. The program is vital to the state’s patients, researchers, and entrepreneurs.

Since its creation in 1982, the program has awarded more than 170,000 grants nationwide, injecting over $50 billion into America’s economy. The model is simple: Federal agencies set aside a portion of their research budgets to fund small businesses with big ideas. The result is a steady flow of funding for startups that are so small, they’re not yet able to attract venture capital — but that ultimately changes lives, improves health outcomes, and drives economic growth.
South Dakota is a proud beneficiary of that model, and an active partner in sustaining it. Over the past decade, dozens of South Dakota companies — many of them spinouts from university labs or small teams of rural entrepreneurs — have secured awards that helped turn bench science into real-world solutions. To strengthen these efforts, the state offers additional $25,000 grants to select awardees, giving startups a boost as they refine their technologies and begin to commercialize them.
This joint support is already delivering results across the state.
Take a look at SAB Biotherapeutics in Sioux Falls. SAB used a $1.42 million Small Business Innovation Research grant to develop immunotherapies that harness genetically engineered cattle that produce human antibodies to treat influenza. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, SAB was ready to respond, using its antibody platform to help develop countermeasures against the virus. That research wouldn’t have advanced without the initial support.
OmegaQuant, another Sioux Falls biotech, used part of its over $833,000 in awards to develop tests that can predict dementia risk, empowering patients with greater control over their health.
The program has also helped fund breakthroughs in animal and agriculture sciences — industries where South Dakota has a competitive edge.

In Brookings, Prairie Aquatech used part of its $1.5 million in awards to refine its sustainable soy-based protein to replace fishmeal in aquaculture feed. The grant helped lay the foundation for a commercial production facility and a growing team of employees. Their success is not just a win for South Dakota’s economy — it’s a model of how environmentalism and agriculture can grow together.
These inventions power a burgeoning sector. South Dakota’s bioscience sector employs more than 7,000 people across 800 businesses. And employment has grown by nearly 7% since 2019. Programs like Small Business Innovation Research are critical for maintaining this momentum.
Failing to reauthorize the program by the Sept. 30 deadline would stall promising research. It would cut off a vital funding source for dozens of small businesses trying to survive the “valley of death” between discovery and commercialization. And it would undermine our ability to compete in the bioscience, energy, artificial intelligence, and other strategic industries.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1785.JPEG-e1757437197822-1024x737.webp,,,2025-09-10 10:57:46.639162

Ladapo argued that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.”

DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

The state already allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, for philosophical beliefs.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and home daycare. Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations.
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Wednesday’s announcement appears to target rules for public and nonpublic schools for preschool, kindergarten through grade 12, and adult education classes.
Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has distanced himself from the proposal but other top Republicans came out in support of the idea. Republican legislative leaders in the House and Senate have been quiet on their positions.

Andy Beshear, left, joins late night TV host Seth Meyers for an interview. (Screenshot)Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear made his late night TV debut on Late Night with Seth Meyers. 
The roughly ten-minute interview aired early Wednesday morning on the East Coast, with the governor touching on a lot of topics that Kentuckians would be familiar with, such as his winning his two gubernatorial campaigns in a red state and his advice to Democrats about how to connect with rural America. 
Beshear also talked about national politics, particularly his opposition to the GOP spending megabill passed by Congress earlier this summer, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Beshear said Republicans “basically punched rural America in the face,” adding that cuts to healthcare in the legislation threaten rural hospitals. 
“This is going to have detrimental impacts, not just to whole communities, but to families. It’s wrong. It’s mean. We need to flip Congress to undo it because that is the only ultimate answer is to rescind this bill,” Beshear said, and Meyers agreed. 
Meyers began the interview with a nod to a regular segment on The Andy Beshear Podcast, where the governor’s Gen Z kids teach him slang each week. Beshear said it “tends to make Dad look a thousand years old,” but he has learned some new phrases. 
“In episode one, I learned the difference between something being ‘skippity’ and ‘fire,’” Beshear said. “And on episode two, I’ve learned I’m ‘doing all this for the plot.’”
Meyers closed out the interview with more personal anecdotes in Beshear’s story that may be unknown to some — his first political losses growing up. Beshear said he ran for student council at his school a few times and lost each time. He also ran for lieutenant governor in a youth government program and came in third among three candidates. 
“I was running because I thought I was supposed to,” Beshear said. “I hadn’t found my why. And what’s interesting is I was probably running on my last name. First election I ever won was in college. It was many years later, and I just ran as Andy.”
Beshear’s father is former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a longtime state politician who also held roles such as attorney general and lieutenant governor. 
The late night TV interview comes as the current governor angles himself to build a national profile. He recently announced a deal with SiriusXM radio for his podcast and hosting live events. Over the last year, Beshear has also regularly appeared on national news programs. 
Beshear is also the chair-elect of the Democratic Governors Association, meaning he will hold a key fundraising position for Democratic candidates during midterm elections. 
Beshear is seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. However, he’s recently polled behind other national Democrats, such as former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-10-at-8.48.08-AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-09-10 10:57:46.639162

New Mexico State University officials say the school is working to educate students to fill the gaps.
The Legislative Health and Human Services Committee met in Las Cruces this week on the NMSU main campus. Committee members were joined Wednesday by NMSU School of Nursing Director Alexa Doig and College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Dean Rick Marlatt. They provided an update on how the School of Nursing is preparing students to meet the health care needs of New Mexicans, especially people living in rural areas of the state.
According to a 2024 report by advocacy organization Think New Mexico, New Mexico needs about 5,700 registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists and about 230 certified nurse practitioners to meet current national benchmarks. The report also notes that the state has some of the oldest physician workforce in the country and nearly 40% of doctors 60 years and older are expected to retire by 2030.
“We want to make sure that [students] understand what’s waiting for them out in the professional field, and the sooner we can get those hands-on experiences, the better,” Marlatt said during the meeting.
Doig highlighted the school’s postgraduate Advanced Practice Registered Nursing certificates, which offer specialized training for nurse practitioner students in several areas, including psychiatric and mental health. “This is really the primary program that is educating and training mental health practitioners who have independent scope of practice within New Mexico,” she said. The program is offered through “distance education,” Doig said, to allow students from all over the state to participate from their location in rural areas or other.
Students studying family practice are also able to complete a second certification program in psychiatric and mental health. The overall program took a hit in enrollment and graduation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Doig said. And while it is still a smaller program, more than 50 students currently participate and numbers continue to improve. She also said about half of the participating students are from New Mexico. 
“I think post-COVID, people really saw, especially nurses, a real need for mental health care providers and they recognize that they can fill that gap,” Doig said. She also pointed to the school’s efforts to integrate primary health care training with behavioral health so all students are equipped to address their patients’ mix of physical and mental health needs. All nursing students take a course on integrated care for diverse populations, which Doig explained “blends and helps amplify the connection between physical health and mental health, and then how to deliver this more integrative care approach.”
Doig stressed the value of having dual certification, but told lawmakers that certified nurse practitioners in New Mexico face the barrier of health care organizations requiring them to choose only one area of practice, rather than integrated care. She told lawmakers she would like to work with them to change policies so practitioners are better prepared to help patients with their various needs, particularly in rural settings or areas with larger health care worker shortages.
“We are in a provider shortage, and we have been for a long time and for the foreseeable future,” Doig said. “There are many jobs available, especially for a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. There is such a severe shortage, our students are often getting job offers before they graduate…Our employment rate data is usually between 90% and 100%.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NMSU-nursing2-1024x715.png,,,2025-09-11 10:56:47.917773

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Last year, Alaska and Canada set a new, lower goal for the number of king salmon returning up the Yukon River and into Canada’s Yukon Territory. 
Now, fish counters show 2025 returns have again failed to meet that lower target after missing in 2024 as well.
Through Aug. 28, when officials at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game stopped counting, an estimated 23,806 Chinook salmon — informally known as kings — had been counted by workers at the sonar site at Eagle, just west of the Yukon border.
Under international agreements, the United States is supposed to allow a minimum number of fish to travel upriver and into the Yukon to maintain the king salmon run and allow fishing in the territory.
Last year, following years of poor returns, officials in Alaska and Canada agreed to restrict king salmon fishing, including Indigenous subsistence fishing, of king salmon on the river until escapement — the number of king salmon crossing into Canada — exceeds 42,500 fish.
The ultimate goal of the agreement is to rebuild the number of king salmon returning until 71,000 kings reach Canada each summer. 
This year’s figures are slightly lower than they were last year, when 24,183 kings reached Canada, but are nearly double the low of 2022, when only an estimated 12,025 kings returned.
King salmon returns on the Yukon River have steadily declined since 2017, when 73,313 fish passed the sonar at Eagle. 
Attention now falls on the Yukon River’s much larger chum salmon run, which is also expected to fail international treaty obligations. As of Sept. 7, ADF&G estimates 276,000 fall chums in the Yukon River, less than a third of the historical run size.
“A run size below 300,000 fall chum salmon is not anticipated to be large enough to meet U.S. tributary goals or Canadian treaty objectives for fall chum salmon,” the department said in an estimate published Tuesday.
As a result of the shortfall, subsistence fishing for chum salmon, a vital part of Alaska Native traditional culture, continues to be suspended. 
Changes in deep-ocean conditions caused by climate change, warming river conditions caused by climate change, commercial fishing, and endemic disease have all been cited as possible reasons for the declining salmon runs.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230623_141443-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 12:57:15.402796

The service transported COVID-19 tests and samples to state laboratories and also has been used by local health departments and public water supply systems to deliver tests and water samples. 
Of 154,196 samples delivered to state laboratories last year, 81,510 were delivered by courier service, Goss said. 
However, when the federal government pulled funding, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment explored alternatives for test and sample delivery, which must occur in a certain timeframe, sometimes within 30 hours, she said.
“In the two years prior to the courier service, the average transit time from collection of a sample to delivery at the lab was 3 days, and since the courier service was brought on in June 2021, the average time has been reduced to 1.8 days,” Goss said.
The difference in transit time is meaningful, she said. 
“Clients and patients receive results quicker, and it has a significant impact on direct patient care and earlier notification to public water supplies of hazardous incidences,” Goss said.
KDHE eliminated courier routes on July 1 to extend the federal dollars into 2026, dropping from 432 environmental and 132 health clients to 192 environmental and 68 health clients, she said. 
Brad Pendergast, city administrator in Scott City, said 2024 was challenging as the western Kansas town figured out a system to send in four monthly water samples. It wasn’t a budget issue, but slow transport of the samples was “a really big headache,” he said.
“It was a source of frustration and a lot of 2024 was like that,” Pendergast said. “At a minimum, we had 10 samples come back and we had to ship them again.”
At some points, they were driving samples 35 miles to Garden City to ship them by FedEx, but eventually the town made arrangements for a FedEx pickup at a local hardware store, he said. 
Health departments and public water departments will have to absorb the cost of shipping samples, Goss said.  
Goss told the budget committee local KDHE partners advocated for additional state dollars to replace the lost federal funding but were unsuccessful. 
“Many local communities still face the challenges of now being short of funding and having to backfill their local budgets to cover paying for their own transit of samples,” she said. 
KDHE is trying to get a bid from the U.S. Postal Service to determine if it could fill the gap created by the end of the courier service, Goss said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ashley-Goss-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-10 09:56:42.120929

Water infrastructure projects in Nevada are heavily reliant on federal funding to ensure safe drinking water. (Photo: Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources)Nevada would lose millions of dollars in funding for water infrastructure and clean air programs under President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by more than half.
Trump and his administration plan to cut the EPA’s budget next year by $4.9 billion, a nearly 55% decrease that would reduce the agency’s budget to levels not seen since the Reagan administration. About half that amount would be stripped from state revolving loan programs that fund drinking water and wastewater projects.
In Nevada the proposed cuts could result in the loss of more than $16 million for state revolving loan programs, according to a report from EDF Action, the advocacy arm of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
Nevada’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which provides low-interest loans and financial assistance to public water projects, would be all but erased, seeing funding reductions of more than 86%, according to the EDF Action analysis. 
The state’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which funds upgrades to wastewater infrastructure, would similarly be devastated by cuts of more than 90% under the Trump administration proposal. 
Last year, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection allocated more than $55 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving funds to 19 communities for infrastructure projects. 
Nevada also saw a surge in demand last year and was set to finalize another $266 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving loan agreements in 2025, according to the agency.
Large water infrastructure projects in Nevada are heavily reliant on federal funding to ensure safe drinking water. The Truckee Meadows Water Authority in Washoe County, for example, was awarded $125 million in state drinking water and clean water revolving funds to build a water purifying facility that would increase water quality and provide a clean water source even in years of severe drought. 
The Trump administration said cuts to the state revolving loan programs were made to return the responsibility of water infrastructure funding to states.
But projects like Reno’s water purifying facility would not have been possible without significant federal funding, said former Administrator for EPA’s Region 9, Martha Guzman Aceves, who helped launch the project.
“These infrastructure projects are so incredibly expensive that states – especially states that have a smaller population, like Nevada – don’t have the economies of scale to do these projects without the federal government,” Guzman Aceves said. 
Without federal funding water utilities would likely be forced to raise rates to cover vital water infrastructure, said Guzman Aceves.
“Responsible governments in Nevada, the municipalities and the water districts, they’re going to make sure that the citizens of Nevada have safe water, but it’s going to come at a much bigger cost. These costs are going to have to be recovered from the rate base” charged to homes and businesses, she continued.
Smaller water utilities that serve rural communities are especially reliant on state revolving loan programs to finance water projects because they can’t afford costly treatment systems or upgrades without significantly raising rates to unaffordable levels.
Silver Springs Mutual Water Company, which serves about 3,000 Nevadans, received more than $4 million from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for six projects between 2022-2024 to replace wells, upgrade tanks, and install new water mains, among other improvements to its drinking water system.
Both state revolving funds provide the bulk of funding for upgrades to drinking water infrastructure projects in the state, including lead service line replacement and treatment for PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” in drinking water.
According to EPA data, more than 485,000 Nevadans are served by a water utility releasing an elevated level of PFAS into drinking water. Nevada also has an estimated 6,783 lead service lines that need to be replaced, according to a 2023 EPA survey.
Trump’s plan to cut the EPA’s budget by more than half would also eliminate the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Program, which provides the state funding to replace older vehicles with newer cleaner engines that reduce air pollution in the state. 
The DERA program helped reduce air pollution that can exacerbate asthma for the more than 269,000 Nevadans who suffer from the condition. In 2023, Nevada was awarded $747,000 to replace four older diesel-powered trucks with cleaner electric trucks.
The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection has also received more than $1.2 million since 2023 from the grant program for an ongoing project to replace diesel-powered buses with clean alternative-fueled versions across multiple school districts.
The EPA cuts would also eliminate the State and Local Air Quality Management Grant, which awarded Nevada more than $4 million in 2023 to monitor air quality standards.
Guzman Aceves called the cuts “unprecedented” and potentially “catastrophic” for state and local municipalities that need infrastructure improvements to tackle growing drought and air pollution. 
“These things are not done on an individual level. You can’t clean the air individually. You can’t go home and have safe water and clean clean air without the government playing a role. It doesn’t work that way. These things have to be done at a social scale, at a community scale, at a state scale, and when the federal government is taking away the most essential tools, the foundations of how we are able to do this, it is catastrophic,” Guzman Aceves said. 
The House and Senate are supposed to complete work on the dozen annual government funding bills by the start of the 2026 fiscal year on Oct. 1, but are still far from final agreements.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/50838934588_f4f44a85f8_b.jpg,,,2025-09-10 09:56:42.120929

(Photo provided by Andrew Bailey's 2024 campaign).One of former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s headline-grabbing actions — a rule that would have required social media companies to provide third-party content moderators — was quietly dropped just before he resigned.
Bailey became co-deputy director of the FBI on Monday and was replaced as attorney general by Catherine Hanaway. The rule for social media companies was announced in May and hailed by Bailey as a protection for individual free speech on popular platforms.
“This rule marks the beginning of a sustained effort to dismantle the ‘Big Brother’ speech-control machinery of corporate America,” Bailey said in a May 6 news release.
The proposed rules were published in the Missouri Register on June 16. Comments closed on July 16, opening a 59-day window for the next step, filing the proposal with the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules. 
The rule was filed with the committee but withdrawn on Friday. Bailey’s office did not put out a news release about the decision to withdraw the rule.
The proposal sought to use the attorney general’s authority under Missouri’s consumer protection laws to impose the requirements. Any user would be allowed to select a content moderator of their choosing — either the system provided by the social media platform or a third party — when they created an account and every six months it is active.
Free speech advocates and lobbying groups for the communications industry filed comments arguing Bailey had overstepped his authority, was imposing unworkable requirements and violated the free speech rights of the social media providers.
“This rule is economically inefficient, technically unworkable and legally vulnerable, representing a regulatory solution that is demonstrably worse than the problems it purports to address,” the International Center for Law & Economics, a Portland, Oregon,-based think tank, said in its comments.
The rule, the Computer & Communications Industry Association said in its comments, would force platforms to allow outside entities to manage content without oversight or privacy protections. 
“This approach would make it harder to remove scams, harassment, and other illegal or dangerous content, while violating websites’ First Amendment right to decide what speech they host,” said the association, which is the lobbying arm of the computer industry.
And NetChoice, a trade association of online businesses that successfully sued to block laws in Florida and Texas that had similar objective, said in its comments that Bailey had misunderstood the U.S. Supreme Court decision in its favor.
In that ruling, the court said the Florida and Texas laws violate the First Amendment rights social media companies enjoy as publishers of content. 
NetChoice wrote in its comments that “rather than respecting regulated websites’ First Amendment rights recognized in (the court decision), the rule would trample over those protections.”
In the withdrawal notice, the attorney general’s office said it agreed with the concerns from commenters about the feasibility of implementing the rule as drafted and that more work would be required.
“The attorney general’s decision to withdraw this rulemaking,” the notice stated, “is not due to comments suggesting he lacks legal authority to issue the rule.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/53541952138_d0d140bb45_o-e1721223103169.jpg,,,2025-09-10 09:56:42.120929

In the town that saw California’s deadliest wildfire seven years ago, a state-of-the-art elementary school is rising. It’ll have a STEM lab, soccer field and outdoor stage — manifestations of Paradise’s hopes for its future.
But while breaking ground and constructing a new 46,000-square-foot campus is one achievement, the road to recovery for the students of Paradise remains long, complex and difficult. It’s a hardship that is likely to become more common throughout the state as the threat of wildfires intensifies, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
The 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people, destroyed more than 18,000 buildings — including most of the town’s dozen schools — and displaced at least 26,000 people. In its aftermath, Paradise Unified reported 154 school closure days, which affected about 4,200 students, according to a CalMatters analysis.
Compounded by learning loss from the pandemic, only 13% of graduating seniors in Paradise Unified met the entrance requirements for California’s public universities last year or completed a career training program, compared with 45% statewide. Only 11% of eighth graders also met the state’s standard for math, and 18% of sixth graders were reading at grade level. District enrollment remains less than half what it was before the fire.
But in the wake of a catastrophe, stressing academic performance or attendance while prioritizing students’ mental health is a delicate balance: For most kids, anxiety and grief stemming from the Camp Fire has made focusing on schoolwork a monumental task. Teachers who lost their homes and now commute long distances have also struggled during the fallout of the wildfire.
Myah Poe, a recent graduate of HomeTech charter school in Paradise, lost her home to the fire. After living in motels and rentals with her family, she was able to return to Paradise two years ago.

Poe: “People see disasters on the news and they think, ‘Oh, that happened, it’ll be over after a year.’ It’s not. It stays with you for a long, long time.”

In the past few months, Christine Matlock Dougherty traveled more than 400 miles from her Yucaipa home in San Bernardino County to Sacramento on three separate occasions to advocate for two bills that would have regulated mental health insurance. 
The measures failed to advance this year, but Dougherty pledges to press on in honor of her son, writes CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener.
Ryan Matlock died of a fentanyl overdose in 2021 after his insurance plan declined to continue covering his stay at an addiction treatment center. After speaking with CalMatters last year about her 23-year-old son’s passing, lawmakers asked her to testify on behalf of two bills to help prevent similar tragedies.
But in a tough budget year for the state, both bills were held in committees that oversee new spending. In the face of those legislative losses, however, Dougherty vows to continue her fight: “I will do it again. For Ryan.”

Intrigue over last-minute legislative deals

Though it’s not unusual for top leaders in California’s government to iron out legislative deals behind closed doors during the last days of session, this week is particularly notable because the fate of so many consequential bills is still up in the air, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Before lawmakers adjourn Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democratic legislative leaders and their staff are working to make deals on whether to join a regional electricity market with other Western states; bolster the state’s wildfire funds; and increase California’s oil production. A $750 million loan for Bay Area public transit systems is also in limbo, with no clear resolution to date.
This lack of transparency is frustrating some lobbyists and advocates, who find themselves relying on draft bill language leaked to news outlets for information. 
But withholding details about deals could help measures advance, since it allows lobbyists less time to object, said former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat. 

Rendon: “Is that the best thing to do? Is that the most democratic thing to do? No. That’s the way our system works.”

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom’s snarky media war against President Donald Trump has successfully raised his national profile, but being an early frontrunner for 2028’s presidential race also pins a target on the governor’s back.

David Michael Winter (1960 – 2025) Essex Jct.
Dave was born on March 19, 1960, in Barre City Hospital and died September 5, 2025, in the McClure Miller Respite House in Colchester, Vermont, after a long battle with cancer.
Dave was a lifelong hiker, climbing his first mountain, Camel’s Hump, at the age of 5; completing the Long Trail at 13 to become its youngest solo End-to-Ender; and continuing to climb Camel’s Hump and nearby mountains until the last year of his life. His appreciation of the wilderness made him a strong proponent of restoring and enhancing our environmental protections.
Overcoming many personal obstacles, he was a fierce advocate for the poor, homeless, mentally ill, and others he believed were ill-treated by society. He worked for many years at COTS, as well as helping people cope with jail release, substance abuse, and other problems.
For several years, Dave was a self-employed logger and snowplow contractor. In his last years, he was a bus driver for GMTA, a job he thoroughly enjoyed, and a proud member of the Teamsters Union, until their leadership supported Trump.
Dave was an avid writer and published several chapbooks of original poetry. He continued to pen new work until the last week of his life.
His many other interests included martial arts, both Tai Chi and Kempo Ju Jitsu, where he proudly achieved a purple belt. While opposed to most forms of consumerism, Dave was a lifelong coin collector; he also collected movies, tools, and Magic Cards.
Dave was a lover of all creatures on four legs, especially dogs. His childhood dog Schatzie was his constant hiking companion. As an adult, he was never in a position to keep a dog, but his family’s dogs (“puppies”) always gave him, and them, joy.
While Dave took his civic responsibilities seriously, working hard to support candidates who shared his views and letting his representatives know where he stood on issues, he may be remembered best for his generosity of spirit and willingness to lend a helping hand to friends, neighbors, and family. He showed a special level of care to his mom, claiming he “tortured that poor woman” as a teenager.
We wish to express our sincere thanks to all the staff and volunteers at McLure-Miller who took such good care of him in his final days. And we especially want to thank all his friends who visited him at both the hospitals and respite house – it did a lot to brighten his spirits. And your friendship is the best testament to the man Dave was.
Dave was predeceased by his mentor and his mother’s long-time partner, Alvin Gover. He is survived by his mother, Hazel Winter; sister, Monique “Moki” Fox; father, James Winter and his wife, Kelly Winter, who hand-knit Dave many beautiful hats; nephew Jesse Fox and wife, Eron, and their children, Irie, Morgan, Lyran, Quinten, Stella, Jacob and Adelaide; niece Lizzy Fox Lausier, her husband, Steve, and their daughter, Sylvia; and niece, Nurto Hassan.

Tampa, Florida


Timothy Joseph Perry died on August 15, 2025 at his home in Tampa, Florida. He was born on August 30, 1951 in Montpelier, VT. Tim is survived by his siblings Betty Tassie, Michael Perry, Ruby Perry, Dave Perry, Mary Patricia Perry and many nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his parents Nelson and Kathryn Perry, his stepmother Gene Perry and his sister Dorothy Stewart O’Mara.
Tim grew up in Montpelier, the fourth of the seven Perry children. He made his way through St. Michael’s School, where the nuns tried – unsuccessfully – to tame his curly red hair and his freedom-loving spirit. He always loved animals, and opened his Florida home to an ever-changing array of feral cats, but he had two all-time favorite pets. One was Oscar the cat who was with him when he died and Black Dog who predeceased him.
Throughout Tim’s life, his best friend, fishing partner and drinking buddy was his brother Mike. He spent much of the Vermont portion of his adult life in his beloved Champlain Islands. Before moving south for warmer climes, he made his home in Grand Isle where his mother and maternal ancestors are buried. His ashes will be returned to the Islands and to Lake Champlain as he requested. We will remember him in his favorite job as a ferry captain for Lake Champlain ferries.
Tim was a self-taught thinker, a voracious reader, and a fixer of all things mechanical. In his Florida years, he smoked cigars and built electric bikes from parts ordered online. For years after his dad’s death in 1995, Tim helped his stepmother Gene with routine home repairs. He followed the news and had strong opinions about…well, everything. He lived every day of his life exactly as he chose.
His siblings started doing weekly Zoom calls at the beginning of the pandemic. Tim never skipped one until the day he died. We will all miss his gruff but attentive presence.
There is no memorial service planned, though the family will gather in the fall somewhere on the shores of Lake Champlain to spread his ashes.

But the biggest barrier was the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program.","In summary
After weeks of tense and messy negotiations, California’s legislative leaders finally released several proposals that range from expanding domestic crude oil production to lowering electricity rates. But the biggest barrier was the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program.


California legislative leaders in the wee hours of Wednesday morning reached an agreement with Gov. Gavin Newsom to extend the state’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction program, known as cap and trade, through 2045 — a contentious expansion that for weeks stewed in backroom discussions, held up other critical legislation and roiled insiders. 
Democratic leaders in the Assembly and Senate also struck compromises on bills to increase domestic oil production in California through new drilling permits and rehabilitating a defunct offshore pipeline; establish a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities; re-up the state’s wildfire liability fund by $18 billion; and join neighboring states’ utilities to create a shared electricity market to sell California’s excess clean power.
The mountain of deals comes after a chaotic scramble of last-minute closed-door negotiations among Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, which frustrated lobbyists and angered rank-and-file members, some of whom said they felt iced out of the conversations.
Because the agreements landed so late in the final week of the legislative session, lawmakers will have to waive rules so they can extend what was supposed to be their last day of session, Friday, to vote Saturday on the climate and energy package. California voters approved a constitutional amendment that requires legislation to be public for at least 72 hours before a vote.
Newsom even made an after-hours visit to the Capitol Tuesday night, where he, Rivas and McGuire huddled in a Senate office for close to 90 minutes. 
Despite the tense, high-stakes haggling, the three leaders on Wednesday triumphantly celebrated what they declared a historic agreement that they said gives Californians the best of both worlds — stable gas and electricity prices as well as progress toward the state’s ambitious climate goals. 
“We took the time to get it right because real change, reduced prices and protecting homeowners is essential,” Rivas said in the joint statement.
The governor’s desire to keep lower gas prices — a crucial headline as he courts a national audience ahead of 2028 — also dovetailed neatly with Rivas’s early commitment to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.” Critics often parroted that lofty goal to challenge legislation that they argued would raise costs for consumers. 
But while Newsom and Rivas were largely aligned on tempering the state’s ambitious climate goals amid the reality of rising costs, McGuire and his staff were wary of handing wins to polluting industries without extracting victories for environmental and social justice causes. 
Bickering over cap and trade
At the heart of the negotiations was disagreement over how to renew cap and trade, which the governor’s office has rebranded as “cap and invest.” The program is a key source of revenue for the state’s environmental, climate and other priorities in the midst of a challenging budget year marked by a $12 billion budget deficit. The Trump administration has also sought to block funding for key priorities such as clean energy, high-speed rail and electric cars.
The extension seeks to align the program with the state’s aggressive push to wean itself from fossil fuels by 2045.

Cap-and-trade is a policy that puts a price on carbon emissions. The government sets a hard limit on emissions and issues a fixed number of pollution permits. Companies must hold permits for every ton they emit — but if they pollute less, they can sell their spare permits for profit, turning cutting carbon into a market incentive.
Although the program wasn’t set to expire until 2030, proponents of reauthorization argued that buyers of these credits — industry polluters — needed certainty that the program would continue to exist to keep bringing in revenues needed to fund the state’s transition to clean energy. A group pushing for an extension, Clean and Prosperous California, estimated that uncertainty over the program had resulted in a loss of nearly $3 billion in auction revenues over a year.
Earlier this summer, Newsom proposed reupping the program without any substantive changes, much to the chagrin of environmental advocates. That was an early sign of his warming relationships with the state’s oil and gas industry as companies announced they would cease operations in California, and more threatened to yank operations due to high costs of doing business.
Ultimately, each chamber will carry a separate piece of the deal.
Assembly Bill 1207 reauthorizes the program and makes slight changes to how the California Air Resources Board distributes free “allowances” — or pollution permits — to various types of polluters. 
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 840 provides a blueprint for how the state should spend revenues from the program, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget, while continuing to support housing, transit, clean-air programs, wildfire prevention and safe drinking water. 
The bill also requires the air resources board to revisit its rules on “offsets” – which let companies cover their emissions by paying for pollution cuts somewhere else — with a study due in 2026.
Individual consumers will continue to reap a benefit from the program. The deal keeps a twice-yearly climate credit, tweaking it so that a break on utility bills shows up during months when bills are the highest.
Other climate bills delayed before deal
Caught up in the negotiations were several other proposals that now can also move forward. 
One is a multi-pronged plan to aid oil refineries by boosting the state’s domestic crude oil production. A key part of the measure waives the state’s landmark environmental review law for new oil wells in Kern County and clears the way for drilling projects to receive permits that were tied up in nearly a decade of litigation. The plan also makes it more difficult to rehabilitate defunct oil pipelines and requires extra layers of environmental assessment. 
Also part of the deal were various Democrats’ strategies for reigning in Californians’ utilities bills, including a Newsom-backed measure to create a Western regional energy market. 
Proponents, including mainstream environmental groups and the powerful statewide electrical workers’ union, say such a market is important for the state to meet its carbon-free goals and lower electricity rates for consumers. 
The package also contains measures for Democrats who want to further regulate utilities to lower costs. 
Senate Bill 254 would set up a public financing system to fund the construction of new transmission lines, which are largely owned by the major utilities. Transmission costs are a significant factor in utility bills. Consumer advocates believe some public ownership of new transmission lines would reduce costs because developers could take advantage of low-interest bonds to pay for them. Funding would need to be approved through the budget process.
Utilities would also be barred from profiting on the first $6 billion in costs the three major investor-owned power companies incur after this year from making their infrastructure more fire-safe. This builds on a similar 2019 law excluding the first $5 billion from profit-making.

“They were kicking and screaming on that,” Sen. Josh Becker, a Menlo Park Democrat and author of several of the energy proposals, said of the utilities.
SB 254 also includes a Newsom priority to add $18 billion to the state’s wildfire fund, which was created in 2019 to pay wildfire victims in disasters caused by utilities to avoid bankrupting utilities. The utility companies had pushed hard to replenish the fund as it was running dry from claims after the January Eaton Fire in Altadena, which sparked near Southern California Edison equipment. 
Contributions to the fund would be split equally among the shareholders and ratepayers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.
Do Democrats have the votes for cap and trade?
Despite the last-minute scramble, it’s unclear whether Newsom and Democrats have the necessary support to clear the two-thirds majority required in both chambers for tax-related measures like cap and trade. Lobbyists and advocates were reading the new language Wednesday and evaluating whether to support the measures. 
The last time the program was reauthorized, then-Gov. Jerry Brown swayed some Republicans and won the support of both the oil and gas industry and CalChamber.
While Republicans have not outright denounced the proposals, Democrats shouldn’t necessarily count on their allyship. Sen. Shannon Grove, a Republican from Bakersfield who for years has warned against overregulating the oil and gas industry, said she was scrambling to assess the details of a plan that was completely secret until just a few hours ago. 
“It’s a multibillion-dollar piece of legislation, and I don’t know what’s in it, so I can’t tell you,” Grove said when asked if she would support the bills.
The business community, including the California Chamber of Commerce and the powerful Western States Petroleum Association, strongly opposed the changes even before the final wording was released, staging an all-out lobbying effort this week as lawmakers returned to the Capitol. 
“WSPA strongly opposes this rushed attempt to reauthorize the state’s Cap-and-Trade program behind closed doors in the remaining days of the legislative session,” the association said in a statement Monday night. Neither the Chamber or WSPA commented on the public cap and trade proposals Wednesday.

Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates — who advocate for low-income and disadvantaged communities that often live closer to polluting industries — and other environmental advocates said the proposal doesn’t go far enough. The coalition was primarily disappointed that the bill to mandate a pollution monitoring program for disadvantaged communities did not include the specific areas and neighborhoods that they outlined in previous legislation. 
The group wrote in a joint statement Wednesday that key parts of their proposals had been rejected and said the legislation continues to make “communities into sacrifice zones for the benefit of industry profit.”
“There’s a lot of money left on the table,” said Ryan Schleeter, a spokesman for the Climate Center. “There could have been more done to shore up that revenue for future years, and there’s a lot of money that’s still flowing to oil and gas corporations through the cap-and-trade program.”

It can make people sick.,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/salton-sea-smell-health-issues/,UCLA researchers have found that hydrogen sulfide emissions at the Salton Sea are at elevated levels and can cause serious health effects to those that live near the lake.,"In summary
UCLA researchers have found that hydrogen sulfide emissions at the Salton Sea are at elevated levels and can cause serious health effects to those that live near the lake. 


Residents around the Salton Sea have long complained of respiratory ailments from particulate pollution that wafts from its shoreline.
Now UCLA researchers have identified another air pollutant that could be sickening people in communities near the inland lake: hydrogen sulfide.
That’s a gas from decaying, organic matter that produces a rotten egg smell and is associated with eye irritation, headaches, nausea and other symptoms. In a pair of reports released last week, the Latino Policy & Politics Institute at UCLA described how algal blooms produce the gas in the water, and how it wafts across nearby neighborhoods.
“Communities that live next to the shore or within a mile of the shore experience exposure to hydrogen sulfide,” said Consuelo A. Márquez, who authored the reports with Alejandra  López, and Isabella B. Arzeno-Soltero. “We hear stories: ‘my child faces chronic nosebleeds and have had asthma their whole life.’”
The Salton Sea crosses Riverside and Imperial Counties, and is California’s largest lake. By many measures it’s also the most imperiled. Nearly twice as salty as the ocean, it’s polluted by agricultural runoffs and toxic algal blooms. Despite its contamination, the sea is a haven to more than 400 bird species and a key stop on the Pacific Flyway, one of North America’s main bird migration routes. 
California recently created a Salton Sea Conservancy to restore habitat for birds and aquatic life. Community advocates say there needs to be greater focus on the lake’s effect on public health in neighboring communities.
“They need help getting treatment, getting medication, or care related to possible cardiovascular and respiratory issues,” Márquez said. “It’s happening at such high rates that a lot of them just live with it. I think there should be more attention put on that.”
The UCLA studies aimed to highlight those problems by measuring hydrogen sulfide emissions at the lake. One study focused on how the chemical is produced in the water. High concentrations of nitrates from fertilizer runoff and low oxygen levels in the water column create an environment that generates hydrogen sulfide gases.
The second looked at hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the air. Researchers installed two additional hydrogen sulfide monitors in the area and found that hydrogen sulfide emissions consistently exceed the California Air Resources Board’s state standard of 30 parts per billion. They recorded 243 hours above this threshold between May and September 2024 alone. 
At those levels – and even at lower concentrations – the chemical can cause a litany of health problems, according to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Those include nausea, eye irritation, headaches, sleep loss, airway problems, fatigue, irritability, poor memory, dizziness and others. 
“As more data highlight connections between water and air-quality, it is crucial to monitor air-quality in all its aspects, not just those related to dust,” the report stated, pointing out that the region is home to primarily Latino, Native American and immigrant residents. “The persistent issue of hydrogen sulfide pollution serves as a clear example of environmental injustice.”
The Salton Sea isn’t the only area with this problem. Hydrogen sulfide emissions also plague areas of San Diego County affected by pollution from the Tijuana River. In parts of South Bay San Diego, researchers with UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC Riverside, San Diego State University and federal agencies found concentrations of hydrogen sulfide about 4,500 times what is typical for an urban area, according to a report released last month.
Márquez said the UCLA researchers are calling for a “holistic systems approach” to improving air quality around the Salton Sea. That could include distributing air purifiers and air quality monitors so residents can play an active role in improving conditions. They also need better access to medical treatment for possible cardiovascular and respiratory issues. Above all, residents want to make sure their concerns are heard and addressed, she said.
“The best people who can create solutions are the people who are affected themselves,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020423-Salton-Sea_AD_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

One of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history, the Camp Fire is among the many natural disasters that have upended student learning over the past decade.


CalMatters is collaborating with The Associated Press, Honolulu Civil Beat, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.
Nearly seven years after Paradise was ravaged by wildfire, the foothill town smells like pine trees again. New homes are sprouting up on once-scorched lots. Construction trucks rumble through neighborhoods. An ice cream shop recently opened around the corner from the newly rebuilt high school. 
But in the town’s classrooms, recovery has been more complicated — and much slower. Even as Paradise gradually rebuilds schools lost to California’s 2018 Camp Fire, officials have found getting kids on track academically — and recreating a tight-knit, thriving school community — is a lot tougher than just flipping on the lights at a new campus.
“We’ll get there, but we have not yet recovered,” said Superintendent Tom Taylor before he retired in May. “We’re not yet where we want to be.”
One of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history, the Camp Fire is among the many natural disasters that have upended student learning over the past decade. Damaged schools, lost homes and layers of trauma have left a mark on thousands of children — a scenario sure to continue as climate change makes these events more frequent and more intense. 
The challenges that persist in Paradise are a reminder of how long learning recovery can take — and a lesson on how schools can give traumatized kids a better chance of thriving long term. 
It’s also a lesson on how to balance mental health and academics in the years following a disaster — and a glimpse into the challenges facing schools in Los Angeles after last year’s fires. For most students, the Camp Fire and its aftermath made it almost impossible to focus on schoolwork. Schools pushed academics aside in favor of mental health, a move that most agreed was necessary but set students back months if not years academically.

“People think, natural disaster — mental health. They don’t think about the academic component to it,” said Carrie Dawes, health and wellness coordinator for Paradise Unified. “You put that aside when you have a little kiddo crying because they don’t have a house to live in. You’re not going to say, ‘OK, snap out of it. We’ve got math to do.’”
Camp Fire left students in a lingering academic malaise
In the Paradise disaster’s wake, students found themselves moving frequently. Schools were temporarily housed in unusual places — hardware stores, warehouses, churches. Nearly everyone was consumed by anxiety and grief. Learning fell to the wayside.
Kenny Michael, a high school senior, was in fifth grade when the fire erupted. Although her immediate family was safe, some beloved neighbors died. Michael spent months grappling with family strife, loss and stress, including over her grandmother’s missing cats.
“It wasn’t just a matter of the fire hitting,” Michael said. “It was all this other stuff, too.” 
Once an enthusiastic learner, Michael failed fifth grade and lost interest in school, saying she was too distracted and exhausted to concentrate on classroom lessons. She’s now living with her grandmother in Magalia, a small community adjacent to Paradise, and attends an online school. She takes solace in talking to friends and writing horror and fantasy stories — about fire. 
But she has no immediate plans to attend college after she graduates this year.

This is typical for Paradise teens. Last year, only 13% of graduating seniors in Paradise Unified met the entrance requirements for California’s public universities or completed a career training program, compared with 45% statewide. Last year, not one student from Paradise Unified enrolled as a freshman at the University of California.
Test scores reflect the academic malaise, prolonged by the pandemic. Among eighth graders, only 11% met the state’s standard for math. Just 18% of sixth graders were reading at grade level. The numbers were even worse for low-income students.
The statistics show that, even once the immediate effects of the fire subsided, academics continued their downward spiral. 
Disaster-related absences take a steep toll on learning
Before the Camp Fire roared through Butte County in November 2018, Paradise was a quiet, woodsy town filled with families and retirees. There was a movie theater, a bowling alley, a pet store and a Foster’s Freeze. Everyone loved the beer brittle at Joy Lyn’s candy shop. In April, residents celebrated Gold Nugget Days with a parade, chili cook-off and a Miss Gold Nugget contest.  
Within a few hours, all of that was gone. The Gold Rush-era town was almost entirely wiped out in the fire. Eighty-five people died, including some in their cars as they tried to escape. More than 18,000 buildings burned, including most of the town’s dozen schools. At least 26,000 people were displaced.
Schools began the long process of recovery as the chaos began to settle: locating students, finding new facilities, assessing the damage and getting academics back on track after nearly a month of canceled classes. 
It’s been a protracted process.

During the 2018-19 school year, the Paradise Unified School District reported 154 closure days across its dozen schools as a result of the Camp Fire, impacting about 4,200 students, according to data analysis by CalMatters. But the impacts of the Camp Fire were far reaching, impacting nearly 1 million students across the state — 15% of all students that year — as drifting smoke prompted more than 1,600 schools to close.
In the following five years, Paradise schools reported up to 10 closure days a year, mostly from winter storms and shutting off the power to lower fire risks on dry and windy days.
Since 2022-23, kids in California have lost more than 3.5 million days of learning because of disasters, according to UndauntedK12, a policy and research group. And that learning loss is magnified because of the stress associated with such catastrophes. 
It’s not uncommon for students to miss school after a natural disaster, either because they’ve suddenly become homeless or due to mental health struggles, or both. But disaster-related absenteeism can take an especially steep toll on students’ learning, according to research from the NWEA, a not-for-profit education research firm. Middle schoolers who lose a week of school due to extreme weather actually miss three weeks of progress in reading and almost four weeks in math, researchers found, most likely due to trouble concentrating.
It’s a concern facing a growing number of schools nationwide.

In North Carolina, some students lost two months’ worth of class this past academic year because of both Hurricane Helene last September and other extreme weather events. The historic Category 4 storm damaged tens of thousands of homes and numerous school buildings, causing mass displacement and academic setbacks. 
In Hawaii, the deadly August 2023 Lahaina wildfires resulted in students at four schools losing at least five weeks of learning days. At King Kamehameha III Elementary, a historic elementary school that burned down in the fires, kids lost more than 50 days of instruction. 
The compound effects of missed class time are evident in Lahaina. Students’ test scores took a sharp dip in the school year after the disaster as kids transitioned between online classes, learning hubs and schools outside of West Maui. Only 29% of King Kamehameha III’s students tested proficient in math in spring 2024, for example, compared with 46% the year before. 
Even at the three Lahaina public schools that remained standing after the fires, students weren’t able to return to the campuses until mid-October because of debris cleanup and environmental testing.  
Students struggled to find motivation in school or attended class sporadically before the fires, according to Lahainaluna High School teacher Jarrett Chapin, and the disaster made matters worse. In the 2023-24 school year, 28% of Lahainaluna students were proficient in English, compared with nearly 50% the year before the fire. Only 5% of kids tested proficient in math. 
Finding normalcy can be a struggle after a disaster
In Paradise, even as the town’s schools set about rebuilding damaged campuses and tending to students and families, the community faced another reality: It would never be the same.
Casey Taylor, Achieve Charter School superintendent, described the first few months after the fire as the “hero phase,” where the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. “Paradise Strong” and “We Will Rebuild” signs proliferated. 
But then a more difficult period ensued, rife with disillusionment. Fire survivors got tired of living out of suitcases, and many were daunted by the hassle and expense of rebuilding. Old friends and neighbors started moving away, bringing further layers of loss, Taylor said. 
“It hurts,” said Taylor, a Paradise native whose own home was destroyed in the fire. “Your community just starts spiraling.”

Enrollment in Paradise Unified has been increasing, but is still less than half what it was before the fire — 1,657 last year, compared with 3,441 in 2017. And the student body is a bit different from before the fire: lower-income, more diverse, more students with disabilities. At least a quarter of the students are new to Paradise entirely and didn’t experience the fire.
In retrospect, it’s clear teachers — and not just kids — needed more support to deal with these changes. Taylor and other Paradise school officials now advise other districts that have experienced a natural disaster, and their top suggestion is to make sure the adults are cared for, too.
“We found that initially, the adults needed attention the most. You think it’s going to be the kids, but they’re so much more resilient in the moment,” said Michelle Zevely, Butte County Office of Education’s deputy superintendent of student programs and education support. 
In Paradise, the community relied on teachers to serve as a backbone amid the chaos. But many teachers also lost their homes, which meant they were haggling with insurance companies while finding new places to live and commuting long distances — in some cases, more than 100 miles — to be with their students every day.
“Teachers just needed to talk, or to cry, but they couldn’t because they’re in the classroom and the students were their top priority,” said Tamara Conry, a former math teacher at Paradise Intermediate School who now works for the state teachers union.
When academics fall by the wayside
Another lesson from Paradise is the importance of prioritizing academics even when the impulse is to drop everything in favor of mental health. The first few years after the fire, school days were dedicated almost entirely to social-emotional activities as therapists and counselors were dispatched to campuses. 
“In the beginning, we did a lot of art and singing. Taking daily walks. We had baby goats and therapy dogs,” said Taylor. “We spent a lot of time talking about emotions, because that’s what we needed.”
The mental-health focus was indeed necessary. Aryah Berkowitz, who was in sixth grade at Achieve charter school when the fire took her home, two of her dogs and her family’s business, said the therapy and teachers’ social-emotional offerings were instrumental in helping her through those difficult years after the fire.
But those activities shouldn’t come at the expense of algebra and reading, Taylor said. 
Once an ambitious student, Berkowitz was suspended twice for acting out after the 2018 disaster. It took her four years, she said, to focus on academics again. But she credits her teachers and counselors in Paradise for helping her through that difficult time, and getting her back on track: She graduated from high school in June and plans to join the Army, pursuing her goal of becoming a K-9 handler.  
Striking a balance between mental health and academics is essential for recovery efforts to be sustainable, Paradise educators and students say, given how long those efforts take, “People see disasters on the news and they think, ‘Oh, that happened, it’ll be over after a year,” said Myah Poe, a recent graduate of HomeTech charter school in Paradise. She lost her home in the fire and bounced around motels and rentals with her family before they were finally able to rebuild and return to Paradise two years ago. “It’s not. It stays with you for a long, long time.”
Poe is now planning to enroll in community college and transfer to a four-year university. Her intended major: engineering, inspired in part by the builders resurrecting her hometown.

Taylor remembers the first signs of renewal in Paradise, when the town became something more than an ashy moonscape. First a gas station opened, then a grocery was rebuilt, and eventually the Gold Nugget celebration returned. Even Joy Lyn’s candy shop reopened. 
For Taylor, the pivotal moment came when her school was able to move back to its original campus after operating out of a church in Chico for three years. Families sobbed when they saw the new playground and the freshly painted school buildings.
The next milestone, she and others said, must be academic. Teachers need to set higher expectations, and schools need to provide tutoring and other support to help students catch up. Emotional wellness and academic rigor should not be mutually exclusive, Taylor said. 
It’s a lesson recovering schools are applying in other disaster-torn parts of the country. 
Just two years after Maui’s devastating fires, for example, Lahainaluna High has doubled down on college preparation for students, introducing an Advanced Placement seminar class last fall that challenged students with intense research projects and writing assignments. The school has also increased enforcement of students’ attendance, contacting parents when their kids don’t show up to class. 
While the rigor and heightened accountability have been daunting for some students, many rose to the challenge and are proud of what they’ve achieved in school, according to Chapin, the local high school teacher. “I think our successes this year have crowded out a lot of stuff that could have paralyzed us,” he said. 
Paradise Unified broke ground in June on rebuilding its main elementary school. The 46,000-square-foot campus will include a STEM lab, soccer field and outdoor stage. 
“It took almost five years before we could see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Taylor said. “But now the light is shining very bright.”

Stan Oklobdzija
Stan Oklobdzija is an assistant professor at UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy, where he researches housing policy.


Across the world, cities have struggled to figure out how to provide more affordable housing to people in need.
In Copenhagen, Denmark, so-called social housing accounts for 20% of the region’s housing stock. In Auckland, New Zealand, a set of reforms initiated by the national government in 2021 created a building boom that dropped rents by 28%. 
Coastal California cities, by contrast, have run a two-pronged strategy for low-income housing over the last several decades — the freeway system and inland counties hours away.
With the California Legislature set to consider Senate Bill 79, a bill that automatically permits dense multifamily housing near high-frequency transit stops, many in the state’s most exclusionary cities have found their eyes filled with tears at the prospect of losing “local control.”
But California’s century-long policy of handing land use policy off to cities and counties has allowed jobs-rich coastal areas to build gilded walls around themselves with segregationist zoning. The result is mass displacement of all but the wealthiest from coastal metros like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego to inland regions like the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire and, increasingly, out of the state entirely. 
Even the most strident neighborhood defenders agree that California is being strangled by a severe housing crisis. According to the Joint Center of Housing Studies at Harvard University, 6 of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the highest share of cost-burdened households are in California. About 1 in 3 renters in the Los Angeles metro area spends 50% or more of their post-tax household income on rent. And as of last year, the city of San Francisco had about 1,000 more homeless people than all of Missouri. 
How we got to this point is not mysterious, nor is it controversial — at least for those who study the issue. For about 40 years, California has simply not produced enough new housing to accommodate demand. 
Further exacerbating this shortage is the fact that the vast majority of California’s new homes are built far away from the coast, even though coastal cities are where the majority of the state’s jobs are located. Land use politics are less fraught in places like San Bernardino or San Joaquin County, where there’s still undeveloped land to sprawl over and where poorer, mostly non-white communities lack the resources to oppose development like their wealthy coastal counterparts. 
The result is an equilibrium that serves no one besides wealthy coastal homeowners. About 11% of San Joaquin County residents and 7.6% of Riverside County residents drive more than 90 minutes each way to get to work. More than just devastating the lives of these commuters — most of whom earn under $49,000 per year and work blue-collar jobs — each of these cars on the freeway is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Also, the displaced newcomers being pushed hours away from their jobs end up competing for scarce housing with inland Californians, making housing more expensive in the regions where there are fewer high-paying jobs. 
Bills like SB 79 are needed because a city’s land use policy has the potential to adversely impact the lives of many thousands more people than the ones currently living within its borders. When costs are borne by everyone, then it is only fair that everyone gets a vote. 
If policy affects the entire state, then it is the state — not the city — that should have the final say.

Died Aug. 17, 2025
Orleans, Massachusetts


Martha “Marty” Van Oot, a distinguished attorney and fierce advocate for justice who was deeply committed to her family and friends, died Sunday, Aug. 17 at her home in Orleans, Massachusetts. She was 73.
Marty was born on November 13, 1951, in Midland, Michigan, to Elizabeth Dawson Oot and Albert P. Oot Jr. She grew up in Westminster, Vermont, graduated magna cum laude from Middlebury College and earned her law degree from Northeastern University School of Law.
Marty served in the NH Attorney General’s Office before turning to private practice and building a distinguished career with several Granite State firms as an admired partner, top litigator, and valued mediator. In 2012, she joined Jackson Lewis in Portsmouth as a partner and practiced there until her retirement in 2021.
She received numerous honors throughout her four-decade career as a litigator, including the NH Campaign for Legal Services’ John R. Tobin Jr. Justice Award for her decades-long work advocating for access to justice, and the NH Women’s Bar Association’s Marilla M. Ricker Award. She was a dedicated supporter of Democratic and progressive candidates and served on numerous charitable and civic boards, including the Granite, Merrimack, and Greater Manchester United Ways; New Horizons, Inc; the New Hampshire Endowment for Health; and the Friends of Norris Cancer Center.
For those who were lucky enough to know her, Marty’s most important legacy will be as a devoted friend and fierce ally whose generosity knew no bounds. She was an anchor of her family, whom she loved beyond reason.
Marty is survived by her son Benjamin Van Oot, his wife Sarah Daly Van Oot, and their children Olivia Van Oot, and Jack, Avery, and Noah Diorio; her siblings Christopher Oot (Sara), Peter D. Van Oot, Laura Oot Sheridan (John), and Betsy Van Oot.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Hoping to capitalize on public interest in, and outrage over, partisan gerrymandering, a grassroots group of Nevadans has filed a proposed ballot measure to establish an independent redistricting commission and prohibit mid-cycle redistricting.
The group, Vote Nevada PAC, also filed a second proposed ballot question to amend the state’s Voter Bill of Rights to include a provision that could force the two major political parties to open their primaries.
Both petitions were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office on Tuesday, according to members of the political action committee. Both proposals involve amending the Nevada State Constitution, meaning  if they qualify for the ballot, they will have to be approved by voters twice in subsequent elections — 2026 and 2028.
Sondra Cosgrove and Doug Goodman, both longtime advocates for statewide election reform in the Silver State, are behind the efforts. Joining their cause this election cycle is former state Assemblymember Claire (Clara) Thomas, who since leaving office in 2024 has left the Democratic party and registered as a nonpartisan.
The independent redistricting commission proposed by Vote Nevada would be composed of a mix of Democrats, Republicans, and non-major-party voters, reflecting active voter registration splits in the state.
Currently in Nevada, redistricting — that is, the redrawing of the political district boundary lines in order to even out respective populations as regions grow or shrink — is the purview of the Nevada State Legislature, where  lawmakers are, with minimal exceptions, able to draw new maps for their own political gain. The governor can veto the maps.
It is an “indefensible, corrupt process that must change,” argues Vote Nevada.
Nonpartisan and third-party voters comprise 43% of the 2.1 million active registered voters as of August 2025, according to the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office.
The proposed ballot question would limit redistricting to the 180 days following the release of the U.S. Census, essentially barring mid-cycle redistricting efforts like those recently undertaken by the Republican-controlled Texas State Legislature.
Cosgrove believes the blatant political gerrymandering in Texas has brought unprecedented interest in redistricting across the country, making it an ideal time to discuss the issue in Nevada.
In previous years, pitching the independent redistricting commission ballot measure to voters involved a lot of explaining, she said, but right now “it’s not hard to say we want to get rid of gerrymandering in Nevada.”
She continued, “People are at least aware that it’s a thing that’s happening and it’s probably bad. It’ll be easier to educate the public now because it’s in the news everywhere.”
Vote Nevada filed proposed ballot measures to form an independent redistricting commission — in 2020, 2022, and 2024. All three efforts failed to make it in front of voters, either because opponents successfully challenged it in court or because they failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.
In 2024, under the name Fair Maps Nevada, two nearly identical ballot measures to form independent redistricting commissions were deemed “legally deficient” by the Nevada Supreme Court because they did not establish a revenue source to pay for the new body they created.
Cosgrove disagrees with the ruling but in an attempt to address it, the new measure transfers existing funding for redistricting from the legislative process to the independent redistricting commission.
After the filing of a proposed ballot measure, there is a 15-day window for legal challenges. Those legal challenges, which go before a district court and often to the Nevada Supreme Court on appeal, can be a death sentence for proposals, either directly through an unfavorable ruling or indirectly by sucking up time and resources.
The Vote Nevada PAC, in a lengthy brief on the history of efforts to form a commission, urged both major political parties to forgo a legal challenge this time around.
The language of the bill has survived the standard legal challenge just five years ago, they point out. The language was also considered by the nonpartisan Legislative Counsel Bureau earlier this year when Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen sponsored the proposal as a piece of legislation. (Democrats did not give that resolution a hearing.)
It has been thoroughly vetted, the organizers argue, and the political parties should “let the people debate this idea and then cast their votes, as is their right in the Nevada Constitution.”
“I am daring them to sue me,” Cosgrove told the Current. “Sue me and I’m going to spend this whole election cycle ripping them to shreds.”
Cosgrove said she’d be happy to point out to voters that Democrats oppose creating an independent redistricting commission in Nevada where they are the majority party but support creating one in Ohio where they are the minority party.
Similarly, Republicans in Nevada are more supportive of the proposal while their counterparts in red states are opposed.
Thomas, the former Democratic assemblymember, says the leaders of her former party should consider the possibility they might one day find themselves reckoning with a Republican trifecta in Carson City.
“I keep saying that the pendulum is getting ready to swing in a different way,” she said. “Republicans stand a great chance in taking over the leadership. And when that happens they will want to do redistricting, and it will not fare well for the communities that I see.”
In 2021, Democrats controlled the legislature and governor’s mansion and passed a series of new maps that were widely criticized by Republicans, progressive groups, and election advocates.
Thomas’ two terms in the Assembly included that 5-day redistricting special session.
She said the lack of transparency criticized by Republicans and observers also extended into the chambers themselves. Assemblymembers like herself, who did not hold a leadership position, had no say in the process. They were simply expected to show up and vote with what leadership presented.
“We didn’t know anything about how they were divvying up the communities until they divided it up,” she said. “Then it was, ‘This is what it is.’”
Thomas ultimately voted for the maps, as did all Democrats except one, then-Assemblymember (now state Sen.) Edgar Flores. But now she is hoping the process can be changed to get closer to the people.
Vote Nevada doesn’t have deep financial pockets to fight legal battles or pay signature-gathering companies.  “We have $0,” Cosgrove acknowledged.  But the PAC is hoping the moment is right for a grassroots movement to form.
Voter Bill of Rights amendment
Vote Nevada’s second ballot measure would amend the Voter Bill of Rights, which was enshrined in the state constitution in 2020.
The proposed ballot measure would add that all eligible voters have a right “to fully participate in all publicly funded elections without limitation, including, but not limited to, any requirement to affiliate with any private organization, such as a political party.”
Politicians, scared of truly open primaries, offer ‘limited’ alternative for nonpartisan voters

The ballot measure would upend the state’s presidential preference primaries, which are publicly funded but only open to voters who register with either of the two major political parties.
Vote Nevada notes that the political parties would be free to engage in privately funded nominating processes. The Nevada Republican Party last year did just that despite the state mandating a presidential preference primary be held. (That split resulted in “none of these candidates” winning the nonbinding state-run primary and Donald Trump winning the party-run caucus.)
Cosgrove and Goodman have long argued that the growing number of nonpartisan voters are being disenfranchised because they cannot participate in primaries, which are often competitive and sometimes decide the general election.
The duo was heavily involved in 2022 and 2024’s Question 3, which proposed a ranked choice voting and open primary election system. The proposal passed in 2022 but failed to pass in 2024. It faced fierce opposition from both major parties.
Many opponents of that measure suggested they were okay with open primaries and that the problem lay with using ranked choice.
During this year’s legislative session, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager acknowledged those frustrations. He sponsored a bill to allow nonpartisan voters to participate in either Republican or Democratic non-presidential primaries. The bill passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
When pitching the legislation, Yeager told his peers he feels the dam to open primaries is “going to break one way or another.”
Thomas leaves Democratic party
Thomas described making the decision to register as nonpartisan as “hard pressed.” She had been a loyal Democrat her whole life but became “disenchanted” by what she sees as the party’s lack of leadership and prioritization of lobbyists and special interests.
“It is not the party that my parents taught me about,” she said. “It’s not the party that I grew up with in Nevada.”
Thomas said the decision was not a direct response to the Nevada Senate Democratic Caucus endorsing her competitor last year for the state Senate District 1 Democratic primary, though she acknowledged there was conflict.
“Did I appreciate the leadership telling lobbyists not to support me? And (saying) if they do support me that their bills would not be heard? Those are tactics that I think we see in the Republican party. Never did I think the Democratic party would do that. But they did.”
Thomas lost the Democratic primary in June last year to Michelee Cruz-Crawford, who would go on to win the general election in the solid blue district. Thomas said she didn’t decide to leave the party until later, following a “really thoughtful process” about where the party was headed.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211113_231447010.PORTRAIT-1-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Manufacturing in Utah is “really taking off,” according to the deputy administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, who was in Salt Lake City this week meeting with stakeholders and small business owners to tout some of the impacts now being felt by the “big, beautiful bill.”
According to William Briggs, who was confirmed to be the second-in-command of the administration in July, the most common loan application coming from the Beehive State is for manufacturing — in most states or cities, the most popular loans are for hospitality or accommodations, helping restaurant or hotel businesses. 
But Utah’s growing focus on manufacturing is “unique,” Briggs told Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, after touring Beacon Commercial Door and Lock, a nearly 60-year-old company that began manufacturing in-house in 2020 and currently employs 64 people. 
Located in South Salt Lake, Beacon credits its success in part to help from the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which helped finance the company’s expansion.

Since 2018, when the company started mulling whether it should manufacture in-house, Beacon says revenue has grown by 28%, its workforce by 22% and its gross profit by nearly 400%. 
The company’s president, Chad Riches, said that’s allowed the company to give better benefits, retirement plans and increase wages. 
“We have more employees that have higher wages, and they pay more income taxes. Because we have more employees, we pay higher employment taxes. The company makes more and so we pay more in taxes,” Riches said on Tuesday, calling it a “return in investment” for the SBA. 
Now, impacts from Congress’ budget bill that passed this summer, known as the “big, beautiful bill,” are being felt by small businesses like Beacon. 
Riches said not taxing overtime and paid or family leave being tax deductible are among the biggest impacts — so is the ability to expense 100% of the manufacturing equipment Beacon bought several years ago to make metal and wooden doors and doorframes at its South Salt Lake factory. 
“It allows us to put time, effort and money into research and development,” said Riches.
Meanwhile, critics of congressional Republicans’ massive tax and spending law have decried the legislation’s impact on health care, as some estimates point to as many as 10 million Americans being at risk of losing medical coverage they receive through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, while states are burdened with higher costs. Democrats contend the tax breaks disproportionately benefit the rich. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But since the law passed, Beacon has ramped up production. It used to produce roughly eight wooden doors each day, now it manufactures 40. It previously would go through about four steel coils — massive coils of steel that can weigh up to 30 tons and are used in door and doorframe production — each year. Now, Riches said, the company goes through 40 coils annually. 
“We never in our wildest dreams thought we could do that,” Riches said. 
Briggs, who was in Utah for a few days this week, said Beacon is “exactly what we want.” 
“This is what the president is ultimately trying to do, to grow manufacturing here — people who produce stuff, people who produce good jobs,” he said. “He’s paying people more, hiring more people, growing his footprint. This is the story we want.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8755-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Federal prosecutors have charged an attorney who represented families in a lawsuit against Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban with a felony charge of making a false statement.
The charge against Carl Charles,  an attorney for Lambda Legal, a national civil rights organization that primarily works on LGBTQ+ issues, comes over six months after U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke reprimanded Charles and two other attorneys for allegedly judge-shopping in the case.
Prosecutors accuse Charles of denying before a three-judge panel investigating that he made a call to U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson’s office “to discuss the filing” and “an upcoming request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,” which prosecutors allege was false.

The charge was filed last month but unsealed on Monday. The news was first reported by Washington, D.C.-based legal journalist Chris Geidner.
Lambda Legal issued a statement on Tuesday supporting Charles against the allegations, calling the indictment an example of government overreach.
“We fundamentally disagree with the characterization of the events that underpin this indictment, which ignores the fact that the routine phone call at issue was acknowledged by the court to be entirely legal and proper,” the law firm said in a statement on Tuesday. “We unequivocally stand behind Carl and all of our attorneys, who adhere to the highest ethical and professional standards every day in pursuit of our mission to advance and defend the rights of LGBTQ+ people.”
The law, enacted in 2022, made it a felony for doctors to prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapies for transgender youth. The attorneys filed and then refiled a lawsuit challenging the law in court.
After a hearing, Burke issued an injunction against the law, ruling that it interfered with parents’ ability to make decisions for their children and that the state failed to prove that the drugs were harmful. In 2023, a three-judge federal panel overturned the injunction. U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down federal abortion protections, ruled there was no constitutional right to gender-affirming care.
The investigation into alleged judge-shopping came in May 2022 after the original lawsuits were withdrawn and refiled.
In February, Burke ruled that Charles and attorneys Melody Eagan and Jeffrey Doss acted in bad faith and attempted to manipulate the court’s random assignment case process to challenge the law.
“The lead attorneys in this case—a high-profile challenge to Alabama state law—tried to avoid their assigned judge by voluntarily dismissing one case and filing anew with different plaintiffs in a neighboring federal district court,” the ruling from Liles states.
Liles publicly reprimanded Eagan and Doss and removed them from the case. Liles also referred the matter to the Alabama State Bar Association. Liles also publicly reprimanded Charles and fined him $5,000. The judge also referred the incident to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Alabama and other licensing organizations.
According to the indictment unsealed on Monday,  Charles, while testifying under oath, first denied that called court staff regarding the matter on the day the lawsuit was filed, but the court then asked another question.
“Speaking of good faith, I want you to think very carefully about this next question and answer you’re about to give,” one of the judges asked according to the complaint. “Are you telling us that you did not call a judge’s chambers and speak to a law clerk about the potential for a TRO in the Walker Case?”
After some hesitation, according to the transcripts, Charles said, “No, your honor.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Frank-M-Johnson-Courthouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 08:56:12.210269

Gavin Newsom has been waging a media war against President Donald Trump — particularly with uber-snarky social media posts — while promoting a ballot measure aimed at increasing Democrats’ congressional seats, portraying it as a way to blunt Trump’s lust for power.
Newsom clearly seeks recognition as Trump’s most effective political foe, political pundits of all flavors believe, thus positioning himself as the Democratic Party’s leading presidential hopeful in 2028.
Is it working? In purely political terms, yes. In polling and other tests of political sentiment, Newsom appears to have become the unofficial frontrunner, three years before voters will be electing the next president.
“California Gov. Gavin Newsom has seized attention like no other Democrat in President Donald Trump’s second term as he works to position himself as a de facto head of the resistance in a leaderless party,” a recent Washington Post article declared.
“Influencers on both the left and the right have discussed Newsom online more than any other potential 2028 presidential contender since Trump’s inauguration …  The attention has been driven by his response to immigration raids in Los Angeles, his efforts to counter a Republican redistricting push and, most recently, his mocking impersonations of Trump’s social media style.”
Alex Hoffman, a Democratic strategist and donor adviser, told the Post: “Democrats are so desperate for leadership right now that they’ll take anything they can get. Gavin is filling a void.”
This week, Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini published a simulated Democratic primary, placing Newsom in first place in a seven-candidate field with “a 29.7% chance of winning across 10,000 simulations.” He’s followed by progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a 19.5% chance, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 13.4%, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at 12.2%, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at 11.3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 9.0%, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at 5.1%. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was not included in the list. 
Ruffini cites Newsom’s “best polling at the moment, the second-best fundraising, and ideological positioning in the middle of the party” as his strongest attributes.
If, indeed, Newsom is laying the groundwork for a 2028 White House bid, he would have to maintain momentum while continuing to govern the state for the next 16 months and move beyond just portraying Trump as the devil incarnate.
In the meantime, his constituents will feel the impact of Newsom’s feud with Trump. For one thing, those who lost homes and loved ones in the deadly firestorms that swept through Los Angeles neighborhoods this year will probably never see a dime of the $40 billion in federal relief funds Newsom and other officials have sought.
Newsom also faces blowback from the universe of right-leaning podcasts, YouTube channels and social media postings. Video clips from some less savory chapters of Newsom’s personal life and political career are already surfacing, such as his infamously unmasked appearance at a birthday party during the COVID-19 pandemic, his affair with the wife of a close friend while mayor of San Francisco and revelations about his drinking habits.
One clip shows Newsom in 2007 criticizing and walking away from a reporter who asked him about the drinking. It’s an example of Newsom’s thin skin, which could be a liability if and when he becomes a presidential candidate. 
Finally, Newsom’s record as governor will be an issue, with critics citing California’s many unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, cost of living and poverty. Just this week, the Census Bureau revealed that when the state’s high living costs are factored in, California continues to have the nation’s highest poverty rate at 17.7%, tied with Louisiana.

Sue Carnell, the chief deputy superintendent at the Michigan Department of Education, will take over as interim state superintendent in October and serve until the man who was selected to permanently take the job can step into the role.
The board last month voted to offer the state superintendent job to Glenn Maleyko, who currently is the superintendent for Dearborn Public Schools. On Tuesday, the board approved allowing Pamela Pugh, the president of the board, to negotiate with Maleyko and his attorney on its behalf.
It’s unclear when Maleyko will begin. The board’s timeline for the superintendent search process had set Oct. 4 as the start date for the new leader.
Tom McMillin, a board member from Oakland Township, asked about the start date during Tuesday’s monthly meeting, saying “I’m just wondering if January or April,” or another date. McMillin said there had been some suggestion that Maleyko might need to remain in his Dearborn role through December.
“All I can say is that we are negotiating,” Pugh said.
Carnell will begin as interim superintendent Oct. 3, the last day for current State Superintendent Michael Rice, who is retiring.
She will be the first Black woman to serve as state superintendent in Michigan’s history, according to the MDE.
Carnell has had a 40-year career in education government, according to an MDE news release. She was superintendent in Westwood Community Schools, deputy superintendent in the Detroit Public Schools Community District, and an administrator in the Southgate Community Schools. She has also served as education policy advisor for former Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
Pugh said in the news release that Carnell “is just the right person to lead MDE as we transition to a new state superintendent.” Carnell said she looks forward “to supporting the staff at MDE as we work with our education partners, the governor’s office, legislators, and families to continue the momentum of improving outcomes for children,” according to the release.
In his final remarks as state superintendent at a board meeting, Rice doubled down on criticism he has made recently about the Michigan legislature’s failure to adopt a budget for the current fiscal year. Lawmakers are required by state law to adopt a budget by July 1, but that deadline has come and gone, and there could be a state shutdown if a budget isn’t approved by Oct. 1.
“This is unacceptable,” Rice said. “The failure to pass a budget timely has led to districts being more cautious in their spending decisions, including their staffing decisions this summer into the beginning of the school year.”
He said some districts are now informing parents that some programs could be eliminated or will be eliminated because of the budget stalemate.
The Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House are far apart on how they would fund schools.
During the public comment period of the meeting, the board heard from a number of education leaders who praised Rice for his role in education leadership, including from a tearful Flint Superintendent Kevelin Jones, who said Rice mentored him during his tenure as the district leader. Rice thanked the leaders for their words.
“And I also want to thank the two people who said good riddance to me. Amen to that,” Rice said.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Data centers are the reason for the explosive growth in energy demand, electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to manage rising costs and impacts on ratepayers, Maryland needs to understand the true impacts of data centers on our state.
Rather than flying blind, Maryland should get a handle on planned data center growth and manage the impacts rather than simply react to them after it’s too late. We can be proactive, rather than reactive like Northern Virginia.
In August, our grid operator, PJM, admitted what we have suspected – that the real reason for growing energy demand is not state climate policies like the electrification of cars, trucks, homes and businesses, but rather data centers.
In an Aug. 8 letter to its stakeholders (primarily electric utilities), the PJM Board stated that “PJM’s 2025 long-term load forecast shows a peak load growth of 32 GW [gigawatts] from 2024 to 2030. Of this, approximately 30 GW is projected to be from data centers.” PJM also said that the “onrush of demand has created significant upward pricing pressure and has raised future resource adequacy concerns … and there exists a large cone of uncertainty around the trajectory and amplitude of future growth.”

More simply; increases in electric bills are a direct result of data center growth, it’s getting worse and we don’t know how much worse.
We also may not have enough electricity for all residents and businesses, such as during weather extremes.  For this reason, systems interconnection watchdog, Monitoring Analytics LLC, says that data centers looking to connect to the PJM grid must bring their own power supply.
Rate increases are not theoretical.  According to a July article in Utility Dive, we saw a major price spike in the PJM capacity market auction last year; another 22% increase from a year ago this summer, and PJM expects record-high capacity prices for the 12-month period starting in June 2026, which could lead to 1.5% to 5% bill increases for some ratepayers, depending on the state.
Data centers are driving up current and future costs for electricity capacity and transmission, and raising concerns about electric-system reliability, the Office of People’s Counsel told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in comments filed in July.
Data centers are not just energy hogs; their greenhouse gas emissions are going through the roof. As recently reported in the New York Times, “Google’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 11 percent in 2024 from the year before. Amazon’s were up by 6 percent. Microsoft’s fell slightly but remained 10 percent higher than they were in 2021. Meta’s most recent figures have not yet been made public.” This growth puts Maryland at serious risk of falling far short of our climate goals.
Given all of this shocking data, we are proud that our state legislators understood the wisdom of passing the Data Center Study Bill (SB116/HB 270) this past General Assembly. Unfortunately, Gov. Wes Moore vetoed SB116/HB270, which would have given the state an analysis of the energy implications of data centers (including energy demand); additional transmission and distribution infrastructure needed; the effect on Maryland ratepayers; potential impacts to air and water quality and water quantity; and the benefits in terms of jobs and state revenue.
There is still hope. The General Assembly can override the veto when they come back into session. This is a critical step to ensuring the state has accurate information about data centers to allow us to plan for and have appropriate guardrails to protect ratepayers and our climate.
As the tech industry and utilities meet with state and local policymakers about the benefits of data centers, we urge them to keep in mind what data center growth means for everyday Marylanders and our electric bills.  We need a plan with guardrails to responsibly manage data center growth in our state to avoid high electric bills, unreliable electricity supply, excess water usage and increased climate pollution.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

(Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard).Washington tribal leaders and environmental advocates are speaking out against the Trump administration’s plan to repeal protections for 2 million acres of national forests in the state.
The U.S. Forest Service has proposed scrapping the so-called Roadless Rule: a federal regulation established in 2001 that prohibits road construction, logging, and mining across millions of acres of national forest land. The rollback would end protections for about 45 million acres nationwide. Public comment on the proposal is open through Sept. 19.
“We are trying to drum up as many comments as we can, telling them that this is absolutely foolhardy and we will not stand for it,” said Lia Brewster, a Northwest conservation campaign strategist for the Sierra Club, during a rally on the state Capitol steps on Monday. 
Volunteers at the Olympia rally gathered opposing public comments from about 120 people.
Rescinding the rule is in line with the Trump administration’s commitment to remove “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk, but also stifle economic growth in rural America,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement last month.  
As opposition boils up, industry groups, like the American Forest Resource Council, are endorsing the administration’s move, saying that leaving the forests off limits has allowed them to grow too dense, raising the risks of wildfires and tree disease. 
Opponents counter that the Roadless Rule allows for wildfire mitigation in the protected areas and argue that more human activity in the forests will increase fire risks. 
More than 95% of the areas under the Roadless Rule are in 10 Western states, including roughly 2 million acres in Washington state and an additional 2 million acres in Oregon. 
Washington lands protected by the Roadless Rule include forests around the edges of Olympic National Park and Mt. Rainier National Park, near Lake Quinault, Mt. Baker and Washington Pass, and much of the Kettle Range in northeast Washington.
“The roadless areas are the marrow of the bone. They are the core of the core, and the most important that we have,” Brewster said. 
In the Olympic National Forest, the Roadless Rule protects critical salmon spawning habitat, according to a map developed by the forest advocacy group Sportsmen for Wild Olympics. 
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule is yet another attempt to hand over our essential public resources to special interests — at the expense of salmon, clean water, and future generations,” said Ashley Nichole Lewis, a Quinault Indian Nation fishing guide and spokesperson for Sportsmen for Wild Olympics. 
The Trump administration first announced its intent to rescind the Roadless Rule in June. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced late last month it had taken the next steps to do so by filing a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 
The Olympia rally was the second of nine stops for the Indigenous-led campaign “Xaalh and the Way of the Masks” protesting the planned repeal of the rule. 
Launched by the Lummi Nation’s House of Tears carving family and the Indigenous-led nonprofit Se’Si’Le on Saturday, the two-week campaign involves taking a newly carved totem pole and 10 cedar spiritual masks on a 1,700-mile journey between rally venues in Washington and Oregon before delivering them to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe west of Port Angeles on Sept. 20. 
“These masks, they represent transformation. They represent leadership,” said Lummi Nation Master Carver Jewell James, adding that the masks and the campaign are intended to inspire people to turn away from environmental destruction and take action.  
“We cannot give up. We cannot believe that this country is voiceless,” James said. 
Volunteers are collecting public comments from rally attendees at every stop along the campaign. About 200 comments against the repeal were collected at the campaign’s first stop in Bellingham, according to Brewster. 
The campaign’s next stops are Portland, Eugene and Hood River in Oregon, followed by Asotin, Seattle and Port Angeles in Washington. 
The Way of the Mask campaign involves Indigenous leaders working alongside various churches and environmental groups, including Disciples of Christ, Unitarian Universalist, the Sierra Club, Center for Responsible Forestry, Washington Conservation Action, Intercommunity Peace and Justice Center, Save Our Wild Salmon. 
“We have to remember everything we can do for these forests will matter in the future,” Unitarian Universalist Rev. Florence Caplow said during Monday’s rally. 
Independently from the campaign, local environmental advocacy groups such as Washington Wild, Conservation Northwest, the Washington Trails Association, Kettle Range Conservation Group and The Mountaineers are encouraging Washington residents to submit public comment this month opposing the repeal of the Roadless Rule. 
Sportsmen for Wild Olympics is one of several advocating for Congress to pass the Wild Olympics Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which would establish new protections for 126,000 acres of forest and 464 miles of river on the Olympic Peninsula. 
Washington Sen. Patty Murray has pushed the legislation for years, and freshman U.S. Rep. Emily Randall, who represents the Olympic Peninsula, has introduced a version in the House. The legislation is controversial, with opponents saying it would hurt the timber industry and the region’s economy. It stands little chance of passage with Republicans in control of Congress.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9547-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

It was filed late last month.,"A highway is pictured under construction. (Courtesy Indiana Department of Transportation)Indiana’s Department of Transportation has asked its federal counterpart to temporarily excuse it from diverse contractor requirements, which the state’s attorney general has dubbed “unconstitutional.”
The Hoosier State is the first to request a waiver, filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation late last month, according to a Tuesday news release. The move was prompted by a preliminary injunction in a federal case featuring a disgruntled Indiana subcontractor.
“I am a firm believer in offering equal opportunity for all to compete and succeed,” Gov. Mike Braun said in the release. “If granted, this waiver will further position Indiana as a state one would want to do business with and as a place to grow your business.”
Braun administration seeks legal opinion on business diversity programs

U.S. Department of Transportation regulations require state and local transportation agencies that receive highway, transit and airport assistance to establish contracting goals for the participation of “disadvantaged business enterprises” that are majority owned and controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.”
Anyone can qualify as disadvantaged — subjected to racial, ethnic or cultural prejudice — on a case-by-case basis. But some are presumed to be disadvantaged: women and Black, Hispanic, Native and Asian Americans.
There are personal net worth, business size and gross receipts standards, however.
“Forcing INDOT to prioritize contractors based on race or gender is unconstitutional and undermines fair competition,” said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who authored a Friday letter in support of the agency’s waiver request.
The letter, also signed by the attorneys general of 16 other states, argued that white or male business owners don’t benefit from the “race and gender presumption.” That’s “plainly” discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional, the letter added.
In the release, Rokita said a granted waiver “would be a critical step toward ensuring that Indiana’s transportation projects are awarded based on merit, not arbitrary classifications, and aligns with our constitutional duty to uphold equal protection under the law.”

Under its proposed waiver, INDOT would go “race- and gender-neutral.”
A new methodology for setting goals and certifying businesses would consider how available economically disadvantaged small businesses are in certain geographies and industries, according to the release.
The agency asked for a three-year exemption, which would end around the time the agency’s next disparity study is expected to be complete. The results will be used to create a new disadvantaged business goal based “solely” on economic criteria.
INDOT will keep offering business development programming, virtual learning, forums and networking events to “DBEs across Indiana.”
It’s the latest step state officials have taken against diverse contracting efforts.
Braun’s Department of Administration is also seeking an opinion from Rokita’s office about the legality of the Governor’s Commission on Supplier Diversity and the Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises Program.
That agency’s Division of Supplier Diversity has called off its next meeting until the review is completed, although opinions are non-binding. The division has also canceled its annual Business Conference and B2Bloom Expo, which showcases opportunities for underrepresented companies to contract with state government.

(Getty Images)While the White House’s fight with elite universities such as Columbia and Harvard has recently dominated the headlines, the feud overshadows the broader and more far-reaching assault on K-12 public education by the Trump administration and many states.

The Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, imperiling efforts to protect students’ civil rights, and proposed billions in public education cuts for fiscal year 2026. Meanwhile, the administration is diverting billions of taxpayer funds into K-12 private schools. These moves build upon similar efforts by conservative states to rein in public education going back decades.
But the consequences of withdrawing from public education could be dire for the U.S. In our 2024 book, “How Government Built America,” we explore the history of public education, from Horace Mann’s “common school movement” in the early 19th century to the GI Bill in the 20th that helped millions of veterans go to college and become homeowners after World War II.
We found that public education has been essential for not only creating an educated workforce but for inculcating the United States’ fundamental values of liberty, equality, fairness and the common good.
In the public good
Opponents of public education often refer to public schools as “government schools,” a pejorative that seems intended to associate public education with “big government” – seemingly at odds with the small government preference of many Americans.
But, as we have previously explored, government has always been a significant partner with the private market system in achieving the country’s fundamental political values. Public education has been an important part of that partnership.
Education is what economists call a public good, which means it not only benefits students but the country as well.
Mann, an education reformer often dubbed the father of the American public school system, argued that universal, publicly funded, nonsectarian public schools would help sustain American political institutions, expand the economy and fend off social disorder.

In researching Mann’s common schools and other educational history for our book, two lessons stood out to us.
One is that the U.S. investment in public education over the past 150 years has created a well-educated workforce that has fueled innovation and unparalleled prosperity.
As our book documents, for example, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the states expanded public education to include high school to meet the increasing demand for a more educated citizenry as a result of the Industrial Revolution. And the GI Bill made it possible for returning veterans to earn college degrees or train for vocations, support young families and buy homes, farms or businesses, and it encouraged them to become more engaged citizens, making “U.S. democracy more vibrant in the middle of the twentieth century.”
The other, equally significant lesson is that the democratic and republican principals that propelled Mann’s vision of the common school have colored many Americans’ assumptions about public schooling ever since. Mann’s goal was a “virtuous republican citizenry” – that is, a citizenry educated in “good citizenship, democratic participation and societal well-being.”
Mann believed there was nothing more important than “the proper training of the rising generation,” calling it the country’s “highest earthly duty.”
Attacking public education
Today, Mann’s vision and all that’s been accomplished by public education is under threat.
Trump’s second term has supercharged efforts by conservatives over the past 75 years to control what is taught in the public schools and to replace public education with private schools.
Most notably, Trump has begun dismantling the Department of Education to devolve more policymaking to the state level. The department is responsible for, among other things, distributing federal funds to public schools, protecting students’ civil rights and supporting high-quality educational research. It has also been responsible for managing over a trillion dollars in student loans – a function that the administration is moving to the Small Business Administration, which has no experience in loan management.
The president’s March 2025 executive order has slashed the department’s staff in half, with especially deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights, which, as noted, protects student from illegal discrimination.

Trump’s efforts to slash education funding has so far hit roadblocks with Congress and the public. The administration is aiming to cut education funding by US$12 billion for fiscal year 2026, which Congress is currently negotiating.
And contradicting its stance on ceding more control to states and local communities, the administration has also been mandating what can’t and must be taught in public schools. For example, it’s threatened funding for school districts that recognize transgender identities or teach about structural racism, white privilege and similar concepts. On the other hand, the White House is pushing the use of “patriotic” education that depicts the founding of the U.S. as “unifying, inspiring and ennobling.”
Promoting private education
As Trump and states have cut funding and resources to public education, they’ve been shifting more money to K-12 private schools.
Most recently, the budget bill passed by Congress in July 2025 gives taxpayers a tax credit for donations to organizations that fund private school scholarships. The credit, which unlike a deduction counts directly against how much tax someone owes, is $1,700 for individuals and double for married couples. The total cost could run into the billions, since it’s unclear how many taxpayers will take advantage.
Meanwhile, 33 states direct public money toward private schools by providing vouchers, tax credits or another form of financial assistance to parents. All together, states allocated $8.2 billion to support private school education in 2024.
Government funding of private schools diverts money away from public education and makes it more difficult for public schools to provide the quality of education that would most benefit students and the public at large. In Arizona, for example, many public schools are closing their doors permanently as a result of the state’s support for charter schools, homeschooling and private school vouchers.
That’s because public schools are funded based on how many students they have. As more students switch to private schools, there’s less money to cover teacher salaries and fixed costs such as building maintenance. Ultimately, that means fewer resources to educate the students who remain in the public school system.
Living up to aspirations
We believe the harm to the country of promoting private schools while rolling back support for public education is about more than dollars and cents.
It would mean abandoning the principle of universal, nonsectarian education for America’s children. And in so doing, Mann’s “virtuous citizenry” will be much harder to build and maintain.
America’s private market system, in which individuals are free to contract with each other with minimal government interference, has been important to building prosperity and opportunity in the U.S., as our book documents. But, as we also establish, relying on private markets to educate America’s youth makes it harder to create equal opportunity for children to learn and be economically successful, leaving the country less prosperous and more divided.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-640128687-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Neighbors have spent a decade fighting to acquire the Roof Depot warehouse in the East Phillips neighborhood of Minneapolis, where a former pesticide plant has left toxic arsenic in the soil. 
The neighbors’ vision is to transform the site into a community cornerstone that would bring much needed resources and climate resilient infrastructure to the historically neglected neighborhood. 
In 2016, the city bought the site with plans to demolish the building — which would bring even more pollution into the overburdened neighborhood by disturbing the soil — and turning it into a public works yard. 
A wave of public backlash and a 2023 protest stopped the demolition of the Roof Depot, giving the East Phillips Neighborhood Institute a chance to begin the work to place it in community hands. People in East Phillips and the city then struck a deal to transfer ownership of the Roof Depot building to EPNI for community stewardship of the long-disputed site. It was contingent on the Legislature coming through with some financial help, however.
A sign urging neighbors to call Mayor Jacob Frey and ask that the Roof Depot site be sold to the EPNI is stapled to a telephone pole Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025.
By working with nonprofits, donors, and local lawmakers, EPNI has already accrued $10.2 of the $16 million price set by the city for this site, even though it’s only worth $3.7 million, according to a recent appraisal. 
This past spring, EPNI worked with legislators to secure a $5.7 million appropriation, but this funding was lost in last-minute, large-scale local funding cuts, the result of federal budget cuts resulting in sudden and unexpected withdrawals of appropriations previously agreed to by the State Legislature. 
There’s a simple solution to this problem, however: Minneapolis can simply drop the requirement for EPNI to pay the outstanding $5.7 million altogether.
Despite legal and public backlash from the get-go, the city spent millions from a public Water Fund to plan and design their public works project plan for the Roof Depot site. 
But EPNI did not spend this money, the city of Minneapolis did.
Minneapolis’ Code of Ordinances makes no reference to the need for Water Fund withdrawals to be repaid, and spending money to consider projects that ultimately do not go anywhere is a perfectly normal occurrence in local governance. It’s a sunk cost, and there’s no point trying to recoup it while the site sits fallow even though there’s a plan in place for something better. 
Supporting EPNI’s purchase of the Roof Depot would also help Minneapolis achieve its own established goals.
Transforming the Roof Depot warehouse into a community-owned hub would bring countless benefits to a neighborhood marginalized by decades of underinvestment and environmental injustice.

An indoor farm will provide East Phillips residents with access to affordable and healthy food, grown locally year-round, while the cooperatively-owned rooftop solar farm would power 200+ homes, providing a projected total of $9.4 million in energy savings. The East Phillips Urban Farm will make East Phillips — and Minneapolis as a whole — healthier, wealthier, and more able to weather climate instability to come. 
The East Phillips Urban farm will also advance many of the goals within the city’s Minneapolis 2040 plan. Alongside creating hundreds of jobs, the project would include space for local businesses to operate as commercial tenants and provide career training services for East Phillips residents, contributing to Minneapolis 2040’s goals for more living-wage jobs and a healthy, sustainable, and diverse economy.
Thanks to the introduction of a steady supply of renewable energy via the cooperatively-owned solar farm, it’s easy to see how EPNI’s project contributes to the Minneapolis 2040 goal of achieving an 80% carbon reduction in emissions by 2050. 
The project also includes ecologically restorative agricultural practices with rain gardens, rainwater recycling systems, and urban pollinator habitats. 
Bringing needed resources and opportunities to one of the most racially diverse neighborhoods in the state would bring Minneapolis one step closer to all residents thriving, regardless of race, ethnicity, or zip code — another 2040 plan goal. 
And what better way to express the multifaceted history and cultural offerings of Minneapolis than supporting space for future gathering, performances and art making?
Given that this project contributes to a better future for all in Minneapolis, why wouldn’t the city make it as easy and affordable as possible for EPNI to purchase the Roof Depot site?",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0542-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 07:56:32.332577

Beth Hankes said her sex shop in Burlington was meant to be “the resource that I hadn’t had.” 
Struggling with sexual health issues and feeling trapped in the corporate world, she noticed a lack of modern, accessible and “joyful” stores selling sex products in the area. So in 2021, she opened Earth + Salt, the first women-owned sex shop in Burlington.
Now a certified sex educator, Hankes runs educational events at the store at least once a month. When Kell Arbor, health and wellness director at the Pride Center, approached the store to ask if they would sponsor Burlington’s first-ever Sex Week, she was so eager that she ended up becoming heavily involved in organizing it. 
The upcoming Sex Week, scheduled from Sept. 14 to 20, features 18 events and runs the gamut from educational panels to art shows and performances to how-to workshops. Earth + Salt plans to host two events, andbut others will take place at the Spiral House, the Karma Birdhouse, the Pride Center and the Burlington Waterfront Park.
Hankes and Arbor pulled together local sex educators as well as their connections in New York and elsewhere to offer the events, that which vary in price from free to roughly $20.
Arbor said Sex Week was partly meant as a counterbalance to Burlington’s more “family-friendly” Pride event, which took place on Sunday. 
“I have been hearing from community members that we need more saucy, juicy, sexy things, not just within Pride, but within the community, centering queer and trans folks,” Arbor said. 
Arbor, whose pronouns are fae/faer, said the events were meant to be LGBTQ+ friendly by nature, but all are welcome. Only two events, mixers for BIPOC Vermonters and bisexual Vermonters, are restricted to people in each of those groups. 
“That’s what equity is about, right? Lifting up the perspectives of people most left out, that we might all see new ways forward,” fae said. 
Arbor said that as an HIV-positive Vermonter, fae have encountered ignorance around sexual health, even among health providers, as an HIV-positive Vermonter. “I’ve seen where the gaps were in my care with doctors saying women don’t get STIs,” or sexually transmitted infections. “That’s very inaccurate. One, I’m not a woman, and two, women get STIs,” fae said. 
Three events are aimedtargeted specifically attoward health practitioners, including one on sexual health for older adults and one on trans-inclusive practices in health care, according to the event website. 
At the same time, the organizers hope to draw people into the conversation by centering and celebrating pleasure in its workshops on kink and other sexual practices. “Pleasure is more of a sustainable invitation in. That’s why I like ‘edu-taining’ models,” Arborfae said. 
Hankes said the event felt will feel like a release point for all the pressures and restrictions that have been building up this year regarding sexual health and marginalized communities. 
“We’re still going to be ourselves,” she said. “We’re still going to have this point of pleasure, education, community and give ourselves access to that, because obviously the government and the current cultural climate is not going to give us that.”
Arbor said events like these feel even more essential in the current political climate. The Pride Center was hit hard by federal funding cuts to HIV prevention earlier this year. 
“When we’re being attacked at our identities because of who and how we love, that’s all the more reason to invite people into education about how we might all free ourselves into more pleasure,” Arbor said. “I’m always like, ‘if we’re too busy having orgasms, we can’t bomb the world.’”

A proposed congressional gerrymander in the Missouri General Assembly would divide the intersection among three congressional district (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline).KANSAS CITY  — A man slept on the cool, gray steps of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, the building and its columns shielding his body from the midday sun on a recent weekday. A few others lingered in the shade under nearby trees.
On Monday evenings, the more-than-century-old church in Historic Northeast Kansas City opens its doors to people in need. It offers a free meal, hygiene products, clothing and a medical clinic. Hundreds often come.
President Donald Trump’s nationwide gerrymandering push has now also arrived at the church’s literal doorstep.
Northeast Kansas City currently sits comfortably inside Missouri’s 5th Congressional District, which encompasses much of the city and the surrounding metro area. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, an 80-year-old Democrat who was the city’s first Black mayor in the 1990s, has held the seat for 20 years.
But Missouri Republicans are advancing a redrawn congressional map through the state legislature that aims to give the party a political advantage. It would crack the city’s urban core into three districts — with all of them converging on the corner of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, home to Independence Boulevard Christian Church.
The intersection’s southwest corner, where the church is located, would move into the 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Mark Alford, a second-term Republican who was previously a TV news anchor. The southeast corner, a parking lot, would stay in a 5th District reshaped to embrace a much more rural and conservative constituency.
The northern side, lined by red-brick apartments and a meat market, would join the 6th District. Held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves since 2001, it would stretch across the state to the Illinois border.
Residents say they fear that dividing the area, with its complex interplay of problems and positive qualities, will dilute their voice in Washington, D.C.
“We need somebody to understand what poverty looks like,” the Rev. Mindy Fugarino, the church’s senior pastor, told Stateline as she described her problems with the gerrymander and how it will weaken the neighborhood’s representation.
“We need somebody to understand, what are the needs for housing,” Fugarino said. “We need somebody to understand what are the needs for fair wages and health care and those kind of things in a community where people are literally living and sometimes dying on the street.”

The Missouri House passed the new map in a 90-65 vote Tuesday, sending it to the state Senate. The Senate could begin work on the map as early as Wednesday.
The Missouri gerrymander marks the latest example of a Republican-controlled state heeding Trump’s call to redraw congressional districts. Creating more GOP-leaning districts would maximize the party’s chances of retaining control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections.
Democrats, both in Missouri and across the country, have condemned the effort as election-rigging. California has retaliated by asking its voters to approve a Democratic gerrymander. Republicans say they want to ensure Congress can advance Trump’s priorities, and they emphasize that federal courts allow partisan gerrymandering.
In Kansas City, the redistricting plan has set off a bitter political battle that’s left many people feeling angry and dismissed. Stateline spoke with residents, business owners, activists and local officials in Northeast Kansas City, where three districts would divide the area, to better understand the consequences of the national gerrymandering effort at the local level.
Northeast Kansas City residents and others broadly described a diverse, multicultural community with beautiful architecture, a strong civic fabric and neighborhood pride. In the blocks immediately surrounding the intersection of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard, less than a third of residents are non-Hispanic white, according to census data.
At the same time, homelessness and crime can be a part of life. Residents are balancing a need for local investment against the risks of gentrification. The poverty rate fluctuates wildly within the area, from less than 12% of residents in some blocks to more than 63% in others. Vacant storefronts are sometimes only a short walk from colorful, tidy houses.
Most community members Stateline spoke with oppose the redistricting effort.
“Nobody asked for this,” said Edgar Palacios, the founder of Latinx Education Collaborative and Revolución Educativa, nonprofit organizations based in Northeast Kansas City that seek to foster Latino representation in education locally. His own home would move into the 4th District under the plan.
Palacios, the son of Nicaraguan immigrants, worried the gerrymander would lead to new representatives for the area who won’t understand the challenges of an urban environment.
“They’re not going to understand the nuances of urban public education and they’re not going to appreciate the differences in how money gets spent or why it gets spent that way or why it’s necessary to do certain things,” Palacios said.
Dan Smith runs Eleos Coffee House on Independence Avenue. The 14-year-old coffee shop is a nondenominational Christian ministry that Smith said draws in both people coming to just work or hang out and individuals off the street wanting help.
Smith declined to offer an opinion on the redistricting proposal, but said he hoped politicians will “totally forget about those lines” when making decisions.
“Because that’s what we have to do here at Eleos,” Smith said. “We can’t draw lines, you know — ‘well, as long as you’re in this group of people or as long as you don’t identify this way or as long as you don’t do this’ — I mean, that’s not helpful for anybody.”
 Republicans say maps are improvement

State Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, presents legislation that would redraw Missouri’s congressional map to a House committee on Thursday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Trump set off a gerrymandering rush this summer in an effort to shore up Republican chances to keep control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
He initially demanded Texas redraw its maps to potentially provide up to five additional GOP seats, and has since urged Republicans in other states to do the same. California has retaliated and other Democratic states may follow.
Republicans in Missouri and elsewhere have been upfront that they are shuffling the map with the intention of improving their party’s standing and say their efforts are in line with a U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision that greenlit political gerrymandering. Missouri Republicans add that their proposed map splits fewer counties and cities than the current one.
“It is an improvement; it is a reform of our current congressional map,” state Rep. Dirk Deaton, the Republican sponsor of the legislation, said at a hearing last week in Jefferson City.
Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who called a special session to pass the map, said the state’s “conservative, commonsense values, rooted in faith, family and freedom, should be truly represented at all levels of government.” He also wants lawmakers to pass a measure that would pose new hurdles to citizen-proposed constitutional amendments.
Kehoe’s office released only rough outlines of the map. After redistricting legislation was introduced in the Missouri General Assembly last week, Stateline produced a detailed map based on census block information supplied by the Missouri House that shows three congressional districts would meet at Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
Republicans already hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats. Cleaver is one of two Democrats, along with U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis.
At most, the new map would likely enable Republicans to take the 5th Congressional District — a single seat — at the cost of a divided Kansas City.
“Two words. One is ‘horrible’ and the second is ‘divisive,’” Cleaver told reporters in Kansas City recently, summing up his reaction to the map.
Cleaver has promised to file a federal lawsuit challenging the map if it passes (other opponents are expected to file lawsuits in state court as well). Giving one example of how the gerrymander would affect the region, Cleaver said Kansas City Public Schools would have multiple U.S. representatives under the map.
“It’s conceivable that two members of Congress could be fighting each other when legislation occurs where one party takes a position and the other party takes the opposite position,” Cleaver said. “That’s absolutely crazy.”
Kansas City is home to some 516,000 people in an overall metro area of 2.2 million. The city is in the midst of a sports golden era that has been a boost to local pride: The Kansas City Chiefs have appeared in five Super Bowls over the past six years and won three; the city hosted the NFL Draft in 2023; it will host World Cup soccer matches next summer. Music star Taylor Swift’s frequent visits to the metro area to see fiancé Travis Kelce, the Chiefs player, have helped, too.
But gun violence remains a persistent problem. As other major cities have experienced falling homicide rates coming out of the pandemic, Kansas City broke its homicide record in 2023. Killings then fell last year, but nonfatal shootings jumped.
Kansas City leaders say their options to respond are constrained. Unlike nearly every major American city, Kansas City doesn’t control its police force. Instead, city-funded officers are overseen by commissioners almost entirely appointed by the governor, a policy with Civil War-era roots. And Missouri lawmakers have almost entirely preempted the city’s ability to restrict firearms.
For some Kansas Citians, the gerrymandered map strikes them as only the latest instance in a long history of Missouri exercising power with little regard for residents. The map cuts much of Kansas City into two along Troost Avenue — once a dividing line during the era of racial redlining that is still shorthand today for the split between the city’s predominantly white and Black neighborhoods.
“It’s sad that they go to this length to try, in my opinion, to disenfranchise people,” said Lonnie Beattle, a retired postal worker who said she lives in the 18th Street and Vine Street neighborhood that’s south of the Northeast Kansas City area.

 Kansas City low point


U.S. Rep Emanuel Cleaver walks through the Missouri candidate filing process in February 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The gerrymander marks a low point in the relationship between Kansas City and the Missouri Capitol, said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
But the second-term mayor, who has battled with Republicans over control of police funding, said that in this instance, the moves by lawmakers have very little do with “purported misbehavior” by the city and more to do with Trump’s demands.
Lucas said carving up Kansas City would mean city officials would have to engage in more lobbying work and more outreach to members of Congress.
“It just adds bureaucracy to a process that currently doesn’t really need it,” Lucas said. “I think everything is working fine right now. One might ask, why change? But obviously, because the president said so.”
While nearly everyone approached by Stateline voiced opposition to the proposed map, the sentiment wasn’t unanimous.
Laura Birdsong, who lives in Northeast Kansas City and calls herself conservative, said that while she understands the concerns, she also sees positives.
“I don’t think it’s an attempt to control, I think it’s an attempt to balance,” Birdsong said as she drove an all-terrain vehicle along Independence Avenue on Friday, shuttling people to and from a local food festival.
Kate Barsotti, a longtime resident of Columbus Park, a neighborhood on the western edge of Northeast Kansas City, said she knew immediately that the gerrymander would be a threat to the neighborhood, dividing it between the 4th and 6th districts. But she suggested the decision could backfire on Republicans.
Barsotti, like others interviewed, emphasized what she views as the absurdity of a congressional district that includes Kansas City stretching all the way to the Illinois border on the eastern edge of the state. Many say that placing so many rural areas into the same district as a dense urban city could upset rural, conservative voters as well.
“So if you want to fight, you’ve just declared war on your own constituents, and I can go anywhere in the state of Missouri and say to them, ‘They don’t care about you,’” Barsotti said.
Some Democrats suspect the party could potentially flip the 4th District, currently held by a Republican, if Kehoe’s proposed map is enacted. Its current boundaries include substantial rural areas but exclude most of the Kansas City metro region. Under the new map, the 4th would slice deep into Kansas City, swallowing up downtown and a lot of Democratic voters in the process.
Lucas said if the map takes effect, he would consider running in 2026 in the 4th District, where he would live. Everyone who cares about representation for Kansas City owes it to the community to make Republicans spend real resources, he said.
“And so I expect there to be a real congressional race,” the mayor said.
 Basic needs

The Rev. Mindy Fugarino, senior pastor of Independence Boulevard Christian Church, sits inside the church’s sanctuary on Monday, Sept. 8. Fugarino opposes a plan to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional districts (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline).
At Independence Boulevard Christian Church on Monday afternoon, preparations were already underway for that evening’s meal.
Tables and chairs were set up in a large basement hall, with a separate space available for families. Fugarino, the pastor, said the church expected to serve some kind of ham-and-turkey casserole.
In a few hours, their guests would arrive.
Later that afternoon and 150 miles away at the state Capitol, lawmakers would begin debating the bill that would split apart the crossroads of Independence Avenue and Gladstone Boulevard.
“I think the whole point,” Fugarino said in an interview about the gerrymander, “has nothing to do with trying to address what citizens are actually needing.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Election observers and immigration advocates are alarmed about a new Trump administration push to bar nonprofits from registering voters at federal naturalization ceremonies, saying the policy shift represents an effort to suppress voters.
The change, made by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, upends a decades-long tradition by nonpartisan groups like the League of Women Voters, whose members estimate they have registered hundreds of thousands of new citizens at such ceremonies.
Melissa Marks, who works with the league’s New Jersey chapter, called the new policy “a blatant attempt to keep new citizens from accessing and exercising their full rights.”
“By shutting us out and other civic partners as well, this policy change makes it harder for new citizens to register to vote, and it’s yet another intimidation tactic and an attack on our immigrant community,” Marks said. 
Spokespeople with Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to answer questions, referring the New Jersey Monitor to an alert the agency issued on Aug. 29.
That alert says the change was necessary to eliminate “the administrative burden on USCIS to ensure that those nongovernmental organizations who provide voter registration services are nonpartisan” and cited “USCIS interests in judiciously deploying limited agency resources.”
The alert noted that new citizens can register to vote online, reducing the need for nonprofits to help them do it at naturalization ceremonies.
“This change in no way impacts new citizens’ access to information and applications to register to vote, as this information will continue to be provided by state or local election officials, or USCIS staff at the end of naturalization ceremonies,” the alert says.










This is really a move that is designed to disenfranchise voters and take their political power away.


– Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice


Zhang Mazi, 33, of Jersey City, said he saw no state or local officials on hand Monday to register voters when he became a U.S. citizen at a naturalization ceremony at the Peter W. Rodino Federal Office Building in Newark. A federal official who spoke to the new citizens told them they should vote in elections but offered no guidance on how to do so, Zhang added.
“Most of the speech was focused on how to get a passport. There was no, like, outside support coming to tell people how they can register to vote. So people just kind of went home,” Zhang said. “I really think that’s a huge missed opportunity.”
He did get a take-home handout that contained a paragraph informing new citizens they can register to vote in person, by mail, at public assistance offices, or when renewing driver’s licenses — without details on how. The handout directed readers to vote.gov.
Nuzhat Chowdhury, director of the democracy and justice program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, noted that the policy change comes amid an uptick nationally in voter ID laws that groups like the League of Women Voters say promote voter suppression, especially in marginalized communities, as well as President Donald Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud by undocumented immigrants. Researchers have examined Trump’s claim and say they have found very few instances of noncitizens voting.
“This new policy pretends to fix a problem that doesn’t actually exist, and it also makes people doubt the integrity of our voting process, which is the sort of fear-mongering about voting rights and democracy that we’ve seen the current administration proliferate again and again,” Chowdhury said.
Amy Torres is executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, which does voter registration work, including at naturalization ceremonies.
Many immigrants have language barriers and a distrust of the government, and without the assistance of trusted volunteers to help them register, the number of new citizens who become voters could fall, Torres said. Some believe citizenship automatically grants them voting rights and don’t understand they must register to be able to vote, she added.
Preventing nonprofits from registering voters at naturalization ceremonies likely will have an outsized impact in New Jersey, a state that has the highest proportion (along with New York) of foreign-born eligible voters of any state besides California, Torres said.
Nineteen percent of eligible voters in both New Jersey and New York are naturalized citizens, with that figure at 21% in California, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center report. More than 45,500 people became citizens in naturalization ceremonies at Citizenship and Immigration Services offices in Newark, Cranbury, and Mount Laurel in the 2024 fiscal year, with another 47,224 so far in the current fiscal year, according to federal data.
“This is really a move that is designed to disenfranchise voters and take their political power away,” Torres said.
She pushed back on immigration officials’ complaints that vetting nonprofits had become a burden or a problem of limited resources.
“There’s a huge naturalization backlog, so I don’t think it’s voter registration that’s causing burdens to the system,” Torres said. “It’s pouring money into enforcement and away from the part of the system that helps people towards pathways to reprieve or pathways to citizenship.”
Marks, of the League of Women Voters, echoed that pushback.
“It’s a burden to ask the USCIS staff to do another job on top of the job they already have. We’re here to help lift that burden. We’re well-respected, well-known for our deep history in being a nonpartisan organization. So we’re not sure what the concern is here,” Marks said.
Spokespeople from the New Jersey Department of State did not respond to a request for comment about whether state election officials would fill nonprofits’ absence at naturalization ceremonies. Chowdhury isn’t betting on them.
“If state and local election offices are the only ones who can now register folks at the naturalization ceremonies, it really depends on their capacity, and we see that they already are stretched thin,” Chowdhury said. “So less folks are going to get registered to vote. Eventually, that does result in voter suppression.”
Marks noted that nonprofits have not been blocked from naturalization ceremonies in federal courts, and the League of Women Voters will continue its voter registration efforts there, while also strategizing how to register new citizens to vote elsewhere.
“We’re not giving up,” Marks said. “We’re still 100% committed to reaching this community.”

Now, they’re, according to one state senator, the “most complicated” in the nation.
Yep, you read that right:  More – not less – complicated. (With taxes, most people prefer “less.”)
To determine your residential property taxes, you’ll now need a compass, protractor, sextant and slide rule to connect the dots to decipher what lawmakers did. And suppose you do unlock that Da Vinci Code: Then you’ll need a lawyer and accountant to challenge your home’s rising taxable value and tax liability, a cardiologist to place a stent to prop open your coronary artery, and a priest to impose penance to absolve your state sins.
Welcome to this edition of the Homeowner Property Tax Shell Game, hosted by Gov. Greg Gianforte and most of your legislators, and led by the Pied Piper of Complicated Legislative Legerdemain, Rep. Llew Jones, the Conrad Republican who serves as de-facto director of much of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the state House and Senate.
First, some background: In 2023, the Legislature and Gianforte raised the state portion of homeowners’ property taxes by about $219 million over two fiscal years. Then they proceeded to spend your hard-earned money.
Montanans expressed outrage, and county commissioners sued Gianforte over a state tax hike as he tried to blame elected county officials for raising state property taxes.
Democrats and Republicans waited until the very end of the 2025 Legislature to pass an even more complicated residential property tax system that requires more – not fewer – taxpayer dollars to hire new state employees to administer the program.
Yep, they cobbled together a more complicated tax system and added bureaucracy under a Republican administration.
Some lawmakers – Democrats and Republicans – have been crowing about this so-called residential property tax “relief.” Don’t believe them. It’s a way of saying, “We picked lots of cash out of your pocket in ‘23, passed complicated legislation this year that gives you some dough back, and raises taxes on select Montana homeowners.”
Right-wing Republicans and some Democrats tried to call out the hypocrisy of the last-minute legislation, which includes rebates that don’t necessarily pay you back for the built-in 2023 residential property tax hike.
The new law, meanwhile, creates a tiered tax-rate system for residential property that generally will result in urban homeowners in high-growth areas paying more property taxes in coming years. Families that own a second home, like a family cabin, will pay even more in property taxes (an estimated 68% more by 2026) because so-called “second homes” are exempt from “relief.”
“The new law doesn’t distinguish between family cabins owned by Montana residents and luxury real estate owned by out-of-state residents,” the Montana Free Press noted.
The 2023 property tax hike socked homeowners while big corporations, railroads and utilities got tax breaks. Now, some lawmakers are complaining that some commercial and industrial businesses will see property tax hikes under the new system. But one lawmaker noted these business entities will just pass their tax increases on to consumers. (Utilities, for instance, didn’t cut consumer rates when they got property tax breaks in 2023.)
Montana voters didn’t think the 2025 Legislature addressed this issue well: In a May 2025 poll, 64 percent of Montanans told Middle Fork Strategies that lawmakers did “not well” in addressing property taxes; 25 percent said they did “well” – a negative 39-percentage point difference.
Couple that with the biennial reappraisals that raise your home’s taxable value (national surveys rank Montana poorly in housing affordability). Consequently, the 2025 Legislature gets low marks in addressing that issue. To wit: 74 percent of Montana voters polled said legislators performed “not well” in addressing housing affordability; 14 percent said lawmakers did “well” – a negative 61-percentage point difference.
If lawmakers won’t fix the complicated property tax system, citizens can act and pass a ballot initiative like the constitutional amendment (CI-130) being proposed by a former Bozeman legislator that would cap increases in residential property assessed valuations to 2% annually.
It’s time for legislators to overhaul this complicated property tax system, bring it into the 21st century, and provide real tax relief to Montana homeowners.

Crowley had already said he was planning to enter the race just a day after Gov. Tony Evers announced he wouldn’t be running for a third term in 2026. Evers’ decision not to run has created the first open race for governor in 16 years. 
In a campaign ad, Crowley, 39, highlighted his difficulties in his childhood and his journey to becoming the youngest and first Black person to serve as Milwaukee county executive. 
“I didn’t grow up in the halls of power. I grew up here and here and here,” Crowley said as photos of his previous homes flashed on screen, “Evicted three times as a kid, having to pick up yourself and everything you own off the curb, it’ll break you or it’ll make you.”
The field for the Democratic primary is still shaping up. Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first to launch her campaign, following Evers’ announcement. State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) has also said she is “very likely” to enter the race. Others considering joining the fray include former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Attorney General Josh Kaul and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
The primary election is just under a year away. 
Crowley said in an interview that Evers has served as a “great, steady, calm strength” that the state has needed over the last decade and he “knew that we were going to need some experienced executive leadership to take over” and someone “who’s going to fight for Wisconsinites all across this state.” 
Crowley was elected to be Milwaukee County executive in 2020. He highlighted the fact that he has managed the state’s largest county, including its $1.4 billion budget, guiding it through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Crowley also represented Milwaukee in the state Assembly from 2017 to June of 2020. 
“I didn’t want any child to go through that,” he said of his struggles with poverty and eviction in his early life, “so I became a community organizer. I went on to serve in the state Assembly, where I saw what happens when extremists had total control, and I’d had enough,” Crowley says  in a new campaign ad. “At 33, I returned home elected to lead the largest county in Wisconsin, helping create thousands of new jobs, cutting our carbon emissions in half, balancing the budget, all while delivering the largest property tax cut in our history and convincing Madison to return more money right back to every local community across the state. But the progress we’ve made isn’t nearly enough.”
Crowley told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that his experience in the Legislature combined with his executive experience set himself apart from other potential candidates. He said he knew on Day One he “would hit the ground running to be able to move our entire state forward.”
Crowley will have to run and win statewide, something he hasn’t done before, before he can accomplish that. 
Asked about challenges Democrats could face in competing statewide in 2026, Crowley said it’s important to recognize people’s frustrations with the Democratic party, especially nationally. He said he has shared the frustrations. 
“We haven’t had a cohesive national message that we could get around that would help energize our base and get folks out,” Crowley said. 
Crowley noted that his experience isn’t just with the city of Milwaukee — the county itself is made up of 19 municipalities with varying needs. 
‘When we talk about the issues that we have focused on — balancing the budget, being able to cut taxes, tackling the opioid epidemic, expanding access to mental health services — these aren’t partisan issues. These aren’t rural or suburban or urban issues. These are issues that are affecting every community,” Crowley said. “My goal is to go and talk to all communities, to let them know that I’m not only willing to listen but am willing to allow those voices on the ground, at the grassroots level, to be able to be part of the solution.” 
Crowley said that he has helped deliver for communities outside of Milwaukee County. He takes credit for leading on Act 12, a 2023 bipartisan law that overhauled local government funding in Wisconsin, boosting state payments for communities across the state and provided Milwaukee with the ability to raise its sales tax.
Crowley said that Act 12 was “definitely historic in nature” — providing funding that communities were able to invest in fire and safety, roads, infrastructure and public services — and gave Milwaukee County and other communities a “bit of reprieve,” but it “didn’t fix all our problems.”
“We’ve had a Republican-controlled Legislature for the better of more than 15 years, and so [Evers has] had to work across the aisle, and this is what divided government looks like,” Crowley said when asked if he would’ve done anything different in recent budget negotiations, which left many Democrats dissatisfied. “It’s not the sexiest or the prettiest, but it means that you have to find compromises… I want to make sure that we continue to do what’s right, but also know that there’s more that we can do for working families.”
Crowley said that’s why it’s important that Democrats pick up seats in the state Legislature in 2026 in addition to keeping control of the governor’s office. Democrats are two seats away from flipping the Senate and five seats away from flipping the Assembly. To do so, Crowley said they cannot “continue to defend the status quo.” 
“We have to look forward. We have to talk about the new vision of what Wisconsin needs to look like,” Crowley said. “What fully funded public schools really means? What does it mean to support families who are in need of  child care across this state, and making sure that they have access not to just affordable housing, but we need attainable housing that is available for folks at all different income levels.” 
Crowley said these issues are all at the root of helping address the “affordability crisis.” 
“People are getting less even if they are making more money, and they need a little bit of relief,” Crowley said. “They’re struggling — trying to figure out how they’re going to put food on the table, how they’re going to keep up with rent or their mortgage, and I know exactly what that’s like. I had two loving parents, who had their own issues and struggled to put food on the table.”
On education, Crowley noted that Wisconsin used to provide about two-thirds of the funding that school districts needed. 
“We at least need to revisit that and figure out how we can get back to that level,” Crowley said. 
Child care was one of Evers’ top issues during the most recent state budget negotiations and he secured $110 million in state funding for direct payments to child care providers. That program will sunset in June 2026. 
Asked whether he would take a similar approach to funding for child care centers, Crowley said that the state should “look at the public-private partnerships when it comes down to funding anything and everything.” 
“As it relates to the services that we’ve provided in Milwaukee County, we can have limited resources, but based off of the partnerships that we have created, we’ve been able to move the needle on many of the programs and services that we offer,” Crowley said. “How do we bring the child care providers into the fold and help them come up with ideas that we need in order to fund them, and I do think that businesses can play a role.” 
On affordable housing, Crowley said that the state needs to work to cut down on bureaucracy and “red tape”.
“There’s a lot of bureaucracy, even if the state wanted to invest in both affordable and attainable housing. You have to wait for local approval, and I think both sides of the aisle understand that we can’t wait for the bureaucrats, and we need to cut the red tape with a type of housing that communities are looking for.”
Crowley added that “what works in Milwaukee may not work in La Crosse, may not work in Wausau, may not work in Green Bay” and that he wants to ensure that the state is listening to people in their communities about what is best. 
Crowley added that there’s “going to be time for us to talk about specific policies,” but he is planning on using “the next couple of weeks, next couple of months, to hear directly from those who are impacted and see what solutions they want to see brought to the table.” 
Crowley added that it would take working with the Legislature to get these things done.
“I absolutely think that one of the things that we have lost in politics is the art of compromise,” Crowley said. “Now, compromising means that you’re finding ways to bring results, and that’s what voters care about. They care about the results, not necessarily the process, but compromising doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re giving up our values to get to a place.” 
Crowley said he would commit to having office hours to work with legislators and hear their ideas “no matter what side of the aisle or what letter is behind their name.” He said this type of communication also needs to extend to every community across the state. 
“The issues affecting communities — there isn’t a cookie cutter solution to them, and there’s no one size fits all solution to the issues that are affecting all of our communities,” Crowley said. 
In his campaign video, Crowley also took aim at President Donald Trump. 
“With costs shooting up, we’re all getting less, even if you’re making more. And Donald Trump’s chaos and cruelty means that the Wisconsin that we cherish will perish unless we unite and fight back,” Crowley said. 
Trump will likely be a major factor in the race for governor in Wisconsin, especially in the Republican primary where the field is also still taking shape, but all of the candidates who have announced so far have closely aligned themselves with Trump.
Crowley said he doesn’t doubt Trump and other national Republican groups will try to “put their thumb on the scale for their particular candidate.” 
“We’re going to run a tight grassroots campaign crisscrossing to every community across this state, letting them know my vision, and I want folks to know whether you’re Democrat, Independent or Republican, there’s a place in this campaign for you, because I’m looking to be the governor for all of us,” Crowley said. 
On the Republican side, Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien and Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann have officially launched their campaigns. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who has spoken to President Donald Trump about running according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, has said he plans to announce a decision by the end of the month. 
In a statement, Berrien called  Crowley’s campaign launch “another career politician” jumping into the race. 
“After years of failed leadership from bureaucrats like David Crowley and Tony Evers, Wisconsinites are ready for a builder to take the reins and lead our state to a bright and prosperous future,” Berrien said. “It doesn’t matter who the Democrats nominate — I plan to beat them.”
Crowley said he isn’t worried about “which Republican” he faces in a general election.
“My fear is any Republican who has the potential of winning this race, and that’s why I’m entering this race now, because we have to unify our party. We have to bring new voices to the table. We have to bring independents back into the fold and build a broad coalition that’s not only going to help me become the next governor, but that’s going to help us win the Senate and the Assembly moving forward.”

North Carolina’s 10 U.S. House Republicans are calling for the immediate removal of the magistrate judge, who released a repeat offender charged with murdering a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte light rail.
The attack occurred August 22nd but has drawn national and international attention this week with newly released surveillance footage.
Prior to the unprovoked attack, DeCarlos Brown Jr. was free on a written promise to appear in court for a misdemeanor charge. Multiple media outlets report Brown faced 14 prior charges, many misdemeanors, dating back over a decade. Federal officials could seek the death penalty in the most recent case.
“By releasing a repeat violent offender on nothing more than his written promise to appear, Magistrate [Teresa] Stokes displayed a willful failure to perform the duties of her office and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,” wrote the congressional representatives in a September 9th letter.
“North Carolina’s justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” said Congressman Tim Moore (NC-14). “Judge Stokes had the chance to protect the public and chose not to. It’s clear that she’s unfit to hold this consequential position and should be removed from the bench immediately.”
The letter is addressed to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, who has the authority to initiate removal proceedings.
In addition to Moore, the letter is signed by Reps. Gregory F. Murphy, M.D. (NC-3), Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Addison P. McDowell (NC-6), David Rouzer (NC-7), Mark Harris (NC-8), Richard Hudson (NC-9), Pat Harrigan (NC-10), Chuck Edwards (NC-11), and Brad Knott (NC-13).
Moore has also co-sponsored legislation seeking to end cashless bail.
State Auditor Dave Boliek waded into the matter Tuesday announcing that the Office of the State Auditor will formally investigate the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS).
“The recent lawlessness and violence that have taken place on Charlotte’s public transportation raise serious questions about the security measures in place. We will investigate CATS and examine its public safety contracts and operations,” said Boliek.
The auditor’s office has notified Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Metropolitan Transit Commission leadership, and CATS leadership that the investigation will begin immediately.

President Donald Trump keyed in on the murder on social media Tuesday saying that the policies of Democrat-run cities have left criminals to pray on innocent people.
“We have to respond with force and strength. We have to be vicious just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand,” pledged Trump.
Figures show that homicides are down in many large cities since 2020.
Lyles, a Democrat, has called the attack on Zarutska “horrific and senseless.”
In response, the Charlotte mayor has pledged stronger policing across the transit system and increased fare enforcement.
On Tuesday night, Lyles, seeking a fifth term in office, won a crowded Democratic primary, with more than 70% of the ballots cast in the mayoral race. She did not address the media after her decisive win.

,WyoFile,2025-09-10 10:30:00+00:00,WyoFile,The Uinta County sheriff decided to raise deputy pay by holding ICE detainees. The arrangement is raising questions.,Andrew Graham and Amanda Manchester,,,,,https://wyofile.com/the-uinta-county-sheriff-decided-to-raise-deputy-pay-by-holding-ice-detainees-the-arrangement-is-raising-questions/,"

The county is holding immigrants — some without criminal records — for longer than anticipated, immigration lawyers say.
The post The Uinta County sheriff decided to raise deputy pay by holding ICE detainees. The arrangement is raising questions. appeared first on WyoFile .","Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp wanted to give his deputies a raise. 
Officers at his municipal counterpart, the Evanston Police Department, earned more per hour. But the Wyoming Legislature’s property tax cuts left the county with less revenue for salary increases.
President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, however, presented an opportunity. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs places to house detained immigrants that the administration wants removed from the country. The Uinta County jail had space.
And so in June, Kopp went before the Uinta County Commission and proposed capitalizing on the deportation drive by holding ICE detainees for a fee.
By holding around 30 ICE detainees a day, Kopp estimated the county could clear more than $500,000 a year, well above the amount he needed to cover his staff raises.  
“As long as President Trump is in [the White House], we won’t have to worry about anything for 3.5 years,” Kopp said, according to a transcript of the meeting recorded by the Uinta County Herald. 
But there are both fiscal and moral risks in increasing his department’s budget on the premise of a steady stream of detained immigrants, critics of the move said. “Making local government dependent on the federal government’s immigration system seems like a dangerous game to play,” Antonio Serrano, advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties of Wyoming, said. 
Kopp is essentially leveraging Trump’s political agenda at the federal level to mitigate the costs of wide-ranging property tax reductions imposed by the Legislature. 
Adapting to cuts
In Wyoming, lawmakers have sliced into the property tax revenues that fund county and local government. Conservative leaders in the House and Senate pushed through a 25% property tax cut during the 2025 legislative session, and local governments statewide have wrestled since with how to maintain services.
Meanwhile, Kopp told county commissioners the salaries he can offer deputies are hampering his ability to recruit and retain good officers. Those budget woes are exacerbated by the Legislature’s property tax cuts, he told WyoFile. 
“Treat them right, pay them well and train them up,” is Kopp’s goal with salary increases, which include the jail staff guarding ICE detainees, he said.

Since the June meeting, Kopp has given his deputies the raises — which will ultimately increase his annual budget for salaries and wages by about $359,000. So far, ICE holds are coming in at the rate he needs to foot the bill, he said. 
“It’s working out as we thought,” Kopp said. 
He is still waiting on the federal government to accept a rate increase to $120 a day per inmate, but said he expects the feds will approve the raise by next month. There are “no issues with that,” he told WyoFile. 
But some of his other stated beliefs at the June commission meeting — that the jail would hold ICE detainees for no more than 72 hours, and that the people the federal agency would book in would be criminals and public safety threats — aren’t holding up, interviews the Uinta County Herald and WyoFile conducted with immigration attorneys and Kopp show. 
Human rights advocates and immigration attorneys worry that as the Trump administration pressures ICE to arrest and deport large numbers of people — White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the target was 3,000 daily arrests — due process and civil rights will suffer and the lengths of detentions will increase. 
In Uinta County, Kopp also described detained immigrants arriving in distress. “There are a few who are definitely scared,” he told WyoFile, “They have somewhat of a panic attack. It’s a scary situation.” 
But as a potential revenue source, the immigrant detention business appears to be booming for now. 
From June 1 through Aug. 27, Uinta County has housed 439 inmates for ICE, for $66 a day, according to invoice data WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald obtained through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. Kopp’s billed the federal government just under $96,000 for those holds. If the federal government does raise rates to $120 per day, that dollar figure would nearly double. 
The $66 per-diem fee was set in 2018. It’s an amount that barely covered Kopp’s costs for holding the inmates at the time, he said. Other agencies with arrangements to hold inmates for ICE, like Sweetwater and Natrona counties, are being paid more. Sweetwater County earns $120, a spokesperson there said this week, and Natrona County is paid $95 a day, Kiera Hett, a spokesperson for that sheriff’s office, told WyoFile in July.

Natrona County has been holding immigrants for ICE on a longer-term basis. More than two dozen detainees in its jail were locked up for six weeks as of Sept. 5. WyoFile profiled one former Casper detainee this month, a Cuban man who grew increasingly desperate as he sat in confinement without a clear avenue to freedom, including through deportation.
Out of public view
Though Uinta County votes reliably conservative, Kopp’s fiscal strategy is generating deep unease among at least some local taxpayers. Kopp is earning money for his department on the backs of policies that separate immigrant families, longtime Evanston resident and local immigration activist Tim Beppler told the Uinta County Herald and WyoFile. 
“When you state that you’re going to engage in those types of activities, and that you’re going to do it for the money, to me that makes it worse,” Beppler said. 
So far, however, the sheriff’s use of his jail to hold immigrant detainees has not spurred widespread opposition. The detentions have been largely happening out of public view. Kopp’s department has not listed people detained for immigration holds on the jail’s publicly available inmate roster since the beginning of August —though the jail continues to hold such detainees. 
Kopp told WyoFile that previous ICE detainees posted to the roster resulted from technical errors, he said. 
Kopp understands his plan will draw criticism, he said. 
“We could definitely be viewed as an arm of their goals,” Kopp said of ICE. “I 100% get that. And I 100% know that it’s a hot topic and not everybody is happy about it. But it’s a way to increase our revenue during a budget shortfall. The opportunity arose … we’re going to take advantage of it.” 
He declined, at least for now, a pitch by ICE officials to enroll his department in a program pursued by a growing number of Wyoming law enforcement agencies that would allow deputies to play a more direct role in detaining undocumented immigrants arrested on suspicion of local crimes. Uinta County, like other southwestern Wyoming communities, has a significant, if still minority, community of Latino immigrants. 
“I want my guys on patrol to concentrate on the citizens of Uinta County,” Kopp said.
But critics like Beppler say Kopp has already allowed the proverbial camel to nose under the tent. “There’s going to be a great deal of pressure to engage more with ICE,” Beppler said. “He’s going to find it difficult to not continue down that road at this point.” 
An old but well-trod debate
During the first Trump administration, Uinta County played host to a fierce debate over immigration detention. Beginning in 2017, private prison companies’ proposals to build a large immigration jail outside Evanston drove years of debate that divided the town and the state. Two prison companies ultimately abandoned the idea of building in the town.
Evanston residents who campaigned against those previous proposals “didn’t want that community to be associated with something that heinous and gross,” Serrano said. “And I think they will probably fight back against [Kopp’s use of his jail for immigrant detention]. Because it’s still gross.”

Earlier this year, a new private prison company made inquiries about building an immigration detention center in western Wyoming, WyoFile previously reported. Though that company focused mostly on Kemmerer, it also made inquiries in Uinta County, according to officials there. 
Uinta County Commission Chairman Mark Anderson told WyoFile in March that he didn’t engage with company representatives.
“All the public hearings, all of these promises of jobs and then these companies pulling out,” Anderson said, “it’s just been so inconsistent that the appetite for it is just not there right now.”
However, Anderson and the other commissioners have backed Kopp’s effort to boost revenue by holding ICE detainees. If the income stream dries up, however, Anderson said it would fall to Kopp to manage the shortage. “Every elected official is responsible for balancing their budgets,” he said. “If revenues decline, the sheriff would have to make hard decisions at that point.”
Short stays for criminal offenders?
When the sheriff pitched the idea to the commissioners, he described a system where the jail would serve as a short stopover for immigrants that ICE was moving about the region.
“When I say ‘holds,’ these are all ICE inmates with criminal records that are picked up elsewhere, not Uinta County,” Kopp said during the June 25 special commission meeting. “They’re dropped off here and they go on from here, no more than 72 hours later.”

One commissioner applauded Kopp for raising funds by helping ICE deport criminals. “These illegal criminals, that as far as I’m concerned, should be deported, we’re helping that process,” Commissioner Eric South said at the meeting, “and that’s important also.”
The Uinta County jail is being used to hold people ICE arrests in Utah, not Wyoming, Kopp told WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald. 
But Kopp and South’s depiction of immigration detainees as criminals does not align with the emerging statistical picture of who is being swept up in ICE’s dragnet. Data indicates ICE is increasingly arresting people without criminal convictions, both nationally and from within Wyoming. 
Under federal law, unlawful presence in the country on its own is a civil offense, not a criminal one. (Entering the country improperly is a crime, but overstaying a visa, for example, is a civil offense.) 
Kopp’s ICE arrangement parameters were first detailed in the Herald’s July 9 edition. Eleven days later, a Salt Lake City immigration lawyer, Carlos Trujillo, challenged the sheriff’s description. “That is a lie,” Trujillo told Utah-based media outlet KSL, “because I can recall at least one of my clients that touched that place and had no criminal record whatsoever.”
Kopp pushed back on Trujillo’s allegation in a Sept. 2 interview with a WyoFile reporter. “I’m not a dishonest man,” he said. Instead, he said, as the summer progressed, he realized it was possible that some people ICE was sending him did not have a criminal record, but that it was difficult for his department to be certain. 
For his part, Trujillo subsequently told the Herald that two of his clients had been detained at the Uinta County jail — one for over five days — and neither had any criminal charges or convictions.  
“Not even a traffic citation. Nothing,” Trujillo said. “Clean records. Yet, they were paraded through Wyoming.”  
One of his clients was working through the naturalization process when arrested by ICE agents, Trujillo said.
Another Wasatch Front immigration attorney, Jared Lawrence, said he had a client held in the Evanston jail who had been in the court process for legal citizenship since 2022. Lawrence’s client had not committed any crimes outside of his illegal entry into the country, the attorney said. They were working to rectify the immigration offense in court. 
All of the attorneys WyoFile and the Uinta County Herald interviewed declined to name their clients, saying they did not have authorization to do so and worried about retaliation from ICE.

One of Utah attorney Nicholle Pitt White’s asylum-seeking clients is a Colombian national married to an American citizen who is expecting their first child in mid-September. ICE transferred the man to Evanston for two days after he was arrested for unpaid speeding tickets, Pitt White told the Uinta County Herald. The man was then transferred to detention in Texas. 
Kopp’s understanding of who ICE would bring to his facility shifted as the summer progressed.  
On July 21, Kopp told the Herald that “we get all information on all individuals’ criminal information before we accept them.” But on Sept. 2, he told a WyoFile reporter that at some point during the summer, he’d noticed ICE detainees arriving at his facility with the letters “NC” on their intake paperwork. Jail deputies learned that “NC” indicates “no charges,” Kopp said.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean they haven’t been charged with a crime before,” the sheriff said, “most of them that we’re seeing are indeed charged with a criminal offense.”
But, he conceded, “I still don’t have a good answer on the NC part.”
Kopp has lent his jail to a system that is increasingly treating people who have sometimes only committed the civil offense of overstaying visas in the same fashion that it deals with criminals, immigration attorneys said. 
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Uinta County jail is a jail for criminals,” Trujillo said. “That in and of itself should give pause to anyone that thinks it’s a good idea to have non-criminals there. It’s inhumane and it goes against our American principles.”
Beppler, the local activist, worried about a form of mission creep. “He will not be able to avoid holding people who do not have criminal charges because it’s part of the ICE system at this point,” he said. “My fear is you begin at a small level and it creeps and grows larger.”
Kopp’s prediction that ICE would only keep people in his jail for 72 hours has also not entirely held up. The agency has at times placed people there for stretches of five to seven days, with the longest stay according to Kopp being a detainee who spent 14 days in Evanston. Another inmate spent 10 days. But unlike the inmates held in Natrona County for weeks on end, Kopp said his jail is not serving as an overflow facility for ICE detention centers in Utah. ICE brings people through Evanston as they transport them east or west, Kopp said. 
The majority of inmates ICE is bringing in, he said, are gone within the 72-hour threshold he first described. But because the Uinta County jail’s public, online roster no longer includes ICE detainees, it’s difficult for the public to assess who is in the jail and for how long.  
Public rosters and detainees
Over the course of the summer, Herald journalists noted what appeared to be a disappearance of ICE detainees from the jail’s online, public roster. 
Throughout June and July, the jail’s public roster showed a number of immigration holds in the facility. A Herald reporter and editor noticed immigration holds were listed often, and in some cases, names were repeated on the roster for days. 
At the beginning of August, immigration holds stopped appearing in the online roster. The Herald journalists continued to monitor the roster throughout the month and never saw another immigration hold. But during that month, Kopp said the jail held as many as 150 immigrants for ICE.

When WyoFile asked about the apparent change to his roster, Kopp said there had been no policy shift regarding which inmates his department listed publicly. Instead, he said the previous listing of people in custody on immigration holds was a mistake due to technical glitches with his department’s system for publishing the jail roster.
“Most jails have policies in place where they don’t log people who might be in transport for various reasons,” Kopp said. “It’s a policy and practice that if we have inmates in transport, we historically, since I’ve been there, don’t tend to put them on the jail roster.”
Other sheriff departments in the state publicly list immigration holds, including in neighboring Sweetwater County and in Natrona County. (The Natrona County sheriff does not maintain a roster on his website, but sends news outlets a roster that some publish most days, and which includes ICE holds.) Officials with both agencies told WyoFile they publish ICE detainees in the public roster, largely regardless of how long they stay in those two jails.  
Wyoming law protects only narrow categories of offenders, like juveniles, from public disclosure — the names of the vast majority of people jailed in the state are public record. Sheriffs can set their own policies about what information to publicize online, Kopp said. When elected, he weighed whether to publish an inmate roster at all, given the stigma a jail stint can bring to residents of small communities like those in southwest Wyoming, he said.

On the other hand, withholding the names of immigrant detainees but publishing other inmates gives the public an inaccurate picture of who is passing through the jail in any given week, Chris Wages, a Buffalo attorney who does public records law work on behalf of the Wyoming Press Association, said in an interview. 
“The number and nature and identity of inmates traces directly back to fiscal responsibility,” he said. “As a private citizen, if my sheriff’s department was all of a sudden doubling their income, increasing their budget, I’d want to know why, under what circumstances, what the source of the revenue is, who’s making decisions, where the resources are being put, and how it affects my local population.”

(Getty Images)After a federal court decision rolled back a Wisconsin law that blocked disability payment recipients from collecting unemployment insurance, Democratic lawmakers have drafted legislation that repeals that law.
Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton)
“Our job is to correct mistakes or ensure that someone’s rights aren’t taken from them. And when this statute originally passed, I think that’s exactly what it did,” said Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) in a phone interview Tuesday after circulating the draft legislation earlier in the day.
“The good news is the court has come down and we now have the proper stance. Now, it’s our job to ensure that those rights aren’t infringed on again,” she said.
Dassler-Alfheim’s draft bill is co-authored by state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee). It codifies a ruling in July by U.S. District Judge William Conley that ordered the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to stop denying unemployment insurance applications from people who collect Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
Conley ruled a year ago that the 2013 Wisconsin law disqualifying Social Security Disability Insurance recipients from collecting unemployment insurance violated two federal laws: The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2021 opposing the state’s ban on jobless pay for people on SSDI.
Conley delayed imposing a remedy in his July 17, 2024, decision. While DWD never indicated plans to appeal the ruling, the department continued to enforce the 2013 law, blocking jobless pay for people on SSDI.
A year after his first decision, Conley ordered DWD to stop enforcing the law, and on Aug. 20, issued a follow-up order on behalf of two groups of people in the original lawsuit.
DWD must pay jobless benefits to applicants between Sept. 7, 2015 — when the SSDI-unemployment ban law was last revised — and July 30, 2025, who were denied because they received SSDI payments. Those applicants must demonstrate that they were eligible for unemployment insurance except for the SSDI ban, Conley wrote.
DWD must also pay back people who had originally been awarded jobless pay but were then required to return the money because they were on SSDI, the judge ordered.
Conley ruled that applicants are not eligible for state jobless pay for weeks in which they received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that was created at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A first-term lawmaker, Dassler-Alfheim said her career in the insurance and financial industry attuned her to the issue that the SSDI ban on jobless pay raised.
“Being keenly aware when people have limitations on income is just something that I’ve always paid attention to,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “Anytime you’ve got restrictions on people . . . when they’re trying to work and something goes wrong, to not be able to give them the compensation — it’s just not right.”
The federal Social Security Administration program allows disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to, and encourages them to do so under programs that ensure they do not lose their disability payments or their medical coverage under Medicaid.
When Wisconsin banned SSDI recipients from unemployment pay, however, DWD under the administration of former Gov. Scott Walker discounted the possibility that people enrolled in the federal disability program might be able to work. A DWD proposal at the time asserted that disability payment recipients who applied for unemployment insurance were probably “double-dipping” and committing “fraud.”
The law was originally enacted in 2013, then amended in 2015, also during the Walker administration. 
The law “really was discrimination,” Dassler-Alfheim said Tuesday. “There’s no reason that that should have taken place.”
DWD proposal could blunt ruling’s impact
Waiting in the wings, however, is a proposal from the current DWD staff that critics say would undo the impact of Conley’s decision.
The proposal is part of the package that the department has submitted to the state Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council — a joint labor-management body that for decades has negotiated and recommended changes to the state’s jobless pay law. DWD presented its proposals — 12 in all — to the council in August.
The department’s proposal on unemployment pay for SSDI recipients calls for offsetting an applicant’s jobless pay by the applicant’s SSDI payment, “to prevent the payment of duplicative government benefits for the replacement of lost earnings or income, regardless of an individual’s ability to work.” 
The recipient’s monthly SSDI payment would be divided into fractions allocated for each week of jobless pay, and the equivalent amount of that payment would be subtracted from the recipient’s weekly unemployment check.
Victor Forberger
For many SSDI recipients that would wipe out their jobless pay entirely, according to unemployment insurance lawyer Victor Forberger. 
For example, a person who gets $1,000 from SSDI each month and is awarded unemployment pay would have $250 deducted each week from their unemployment benefits. 
“Very few SSDI recipients have a weekly unemployment insurance benefit of more than $250,” Forberger said in an interview in July — meaning that they would probably not collect any jobless pay at all despite qualifying for it. 
In a statement Tuesday, DWD defended the proposal.
The administration of Gov. Tony Evers has three times proposed budgets that would end the ban on UI for SSDI recipients on the grounds that “denying unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to social security disability insurance (SSDI) recipients was discriminatory,” DWD’s statement said.
Those same proposals included offset provisions. DWD said that those proposals “mirrored the treatment [of] SSDI with the treatment of pensions and lump sum payments under UI law.” Those payments can similarly reduce an unemployment insurance award. 
Lawmakers on the state Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee threw all those changes out of the budget each time, however. 
Conley’s July 2024 opinion found barring jobless pay for SSDI recipients violated federal law, the DWD statement said. But, the department statement added, his ruling also “noted that offsets to the receipt of SSDI have been upheld by other courts.” 
Conley’s most recent orders blocked DWD from enforcing the SSDI unemployment insurance ban, “but did not order an offset,” said the DWD statement, calling the judge’s order “consistent with DWD’s policy position.”
“DWD has already begun processing payments for individuals who receive SSDI,” the statement said. “DWD will continue [to] meet the requirements of the court’s order and any legislation that is signed into law.”
Forberger said reducing jobless pay by the amount of a recipient’s SSDI payment would effectively nullify the court’s ruling, however. “It would perpetuate the discrimination,” he said. 
SSDI benefits are “a bare minimum and in some cases not even that,” Forberger said. People enrolled in SSDI and who also take jobs “need to do this work to support themselves.”
Dassler-Alfheim told the Wisconsin Examiner that she would oppose including the offset proposal in a UI revision bill. 
“If they lose that job that they have gone out of their way to get, even though they’re disabled, they certainly deserve to be compensated for their unemployment at the same rate, under the same scruples, as anybody else,” Dassler-Alfheim said.
“These are people that are doing exactly what society wants them to do — not sitting home on a disability check,” she added. “Why would we disincentivize by removing benefits if they were to lose their job for something they didn’t do?”

The Dubois Badlands are not a remote, difficult-to-find wilderness, but they’re just far enough from the beaten path to feel like it. Located on the north side of U.S. Highway 26 near the small town of Dubois, the badlands are an ecologically unique part of the Equality State with opportunities for recreation and contemplation.
One of the most popular ways to explore the badlands is on foot. After turning off the highway to the main entrance on Kingfisher Road, visitors may park and enter through a chain-link gate. Dusty footpaths wind for miles: first through Wyoming State Trust Land, then land owned by the Bureau of Land Management. There are no marked trails, though visitors may follow the Dubois Badlands Trail found on the AllTrails app. This route offers views of the red rock spires and buttes that make the badlands unique. Visitors should be warned that there is no shade in the easily accessible parts of the badlands, making a hat and water must-brings for an adventure here.
Wildlife lovers visiting the area will find much to appreciate. The greater short-horned lizard, better known as the horny toad — Wyoming’s state reptile — can be seen hurrying alongside hiking trails. Eagle-eyed searchers may also find members of the Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep herd. Other Wyoming megafauna like elk, black bear and pronghorn may be found in the badlands, too.

The distinction between Wyoming State Trust and BLM land in the Dubois Badlands is important. Wyoming State Trust lands are managed by the state government to maximize profitability for the state’s K-12 education. While management varies from place to place, the WST lands in the Dubois Badlands allow recreation like hiking, horseback riding and motorized vehicle use. Camping, however, is not permitted.
The State Trust land is mostly flat, with some small hills running through sagebrush and barrel cacti. Late spring and early summer see wildflowers bloom through the basin, and water may rush down the wide stream bed that descends from the crags and buttes of the BLM area.
Situated behind the State Trust land are 4,250 acres owned by the BLM. The land is designated a Wilderness Study Area, which means it is managed as if it has a congressional wilderness designation. A wilderness designation ensures the primitive character of a landscape remains intact. Visitors to the area may hike, ride, hunt or fish, but mechanical items like mountain bikes or side-by-sides may not be used there. Visitors to the area may camp in the BLM land.
Deeper into the badlands, the BLM land is geologically fascinating. Visitors may get closer to the red, white, and orange stripes that feature prominently on the area’s rock walls. Adventurous souls may attempt to visit the gray spires of Joe Back’s Throne, a soaring cirque named for a local artist and outfitter.

The BLM does not advertise the space as particularly user-friendly. “Day hiking would be possible, but the WSA’s size and lack of water limits its attraction for extended backpacking,” the BLM’s webpage states. Challenges aside, “the area’s relatively unique geology and its scenery are major attractions.”
The Friends of the Dubois Badlands is a local nonprofit dedicated to preserving and protecting the area with the Wilderness Study Area designation. The group of local artists, scientists, sportspeople and more “want people to appreciate how beautiful this is but also want them to know what to do/not do in order to protect this marvelous gift.”
The group holds regular events that promote engagement with the badlands, including lectures on ecology and guided hikes, and collaborates with government agencies. In 2024, the Friends and the Wyoming State Lands office cleaned up an illegal garbage dump, while in 2022, the group teamed with the Lander BLM office to pull over a mile of unneeded barbed wire from the Wilderness Study Area.
Though not very well-known, the Dubois Badlands offer an excellent, quiet place for Wyoming locals and tourists alike to visit. As the weather cools, visit this unique area for hiking, wildlife viewing and to experience another side of wild Wyoming.

(Getty Images)Idaho officials may look to tap a new rural hospital fund created in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed by Congress to increase medical training in the state. 
The Idaho Medical Education Working Group — made up of legislators and medical field stakeholders — is looking to craft legislative recommendations to enhance medical education in the state and address its significant physician shortage, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. At the group’s meeting Monday, members discussed potentially leveraging a new tool, created by the massive federal tax and spending law, to improve opportunities for graduate medical education in rural health centers. 
Those rural health systems and other small ones may also be facing more significant challenges due to the major spending reductions in Medicaid that was also included in the law. 
Dr. Ted Epperly, president and CEO of Full Circle Health and a work group member, said his organization will be one of many that will be affected. 
“Forty percent of our patients are Medicaid patients,” Epperly said Monday. “With the cuts that are designed to come to Medicaid, it’s going to have a significant impact on our revenue streams.” 
 The Big Beautiful Bill’s effect on Idaho’s medical education is unclear and mixed

Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, the Sun reported. The reductions will come from a combination of new policies, including work requirements for some participants, increased requirements to check and renew eligibility, and removing from the rolls participants who aren’t citizens or don’t have a green card. 
“The impacts and funding streams and health care now are absolutely up in the air,” Epperly said regarding the federal changes.

He said more uninsured patients mean that some hospitals will have to try and figure out ways to make up costs to treat those patients. 
The working group on Monday focused on increasing the number of graduate residency programs, which doctors who graduate medical school must complete to practice medicine, to help recruit and retain more doctors in Idaho. However, hosting a residency is expensive and time consuming, speakers said at the meeting, and it’s difficult for rural hospitals to do so. 
Epperly said training a graduate resident costs about $210,000 per resident per year, because “it takes a lot of people to train a resident.” When the state of Idaho developed a plan in 2017 to increase the number of residencies in Idaho, it was estimated to cost about $180,000 per resident per year — a cost that is shared among the state, the program doing the training and the sponsoring institution. 
“The challenge is going to be the funding mechanism,” said Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association. “And when most of our rural hospitals are operating at either a 1% or less margin, it’s difficult to find the funding within that current structure.” 
Whitlock and Epperly identified upcoming funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program, created in the tax and spending bill, as an opportunity to grow residencies in rural Idaho. The fund will establish $50 billion that can go to states over the next five years; half of the funding will go out to each state in equal distributions and half will be available to apply for and will be allocated based on factors such as rural population, the proportion of rural health facilities in the state, and the situation of certain hospitals in the state, according to the website for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. 
Workforce development is one of the strategic goals of the rural hospital fund, the website said. The public can submit input to shape Idaho’s application to the Rural Health Transformation Program online through a survey until Sept. 30.
Around 58% of medical residents who train in Idaho stay in the state, according to Epperly’s presentation, which places Idaho’s retention as seventh highest in the U.S. 
He told other work group members that the Rural Health Transformation Program “ought to be a mechanism by which we could put our heads together in the state of Idaho and figure out how potentially we could tap that money to help both rural hospitals and rural health systems develop GME (graduate medical education).” 
Whitlock, head of the Idaho Hospital Association, said in the prior two weeks he traveled to hospitals across the state and leaders all asked about the new rural health fund. 
“As we talk to every one of our hospitals, the No. 1 concern that they have moving forward for the next five years is how to recruit and retain physicians in this state,” Whitlock said. “The second is, how do we find the space and the ability to train and teach students?”
With Idaho’s rapid population growth, he said, infrastructure improvements and increased space to practice and teach should be considered for these funds. 
 Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo: ‘rural hospitals are in serious trouble today’ 

As chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, was a key figure in crafting much of the final version of the tax and spending bill, including the rural health fund. 
He told the Sun in an August interview that he thought the concerns about Medicaid reductions in the law were “overstated, but the concerns about rural hospitals are not overstated.”

“Rural hospitals are in serious trouble today, and nothing in the One Big Beautiful Bill on Medicaid will go into effect until 2028,” Crapo said. 
He said that lawmakers opted to distribute half the funding equally to avoid concerns over a formula that may give larger sums to more populous states. 
“And that was a political negotiation to help every state feel like no matter how this fund got distributed, they were going to get at least a fair share,” Crapo said. 
The law didn’t create criteria for how the rest of the funds should be distributed, largely giving discretion to CMS. 
He said that often the problem in rural Idaho hospitals stems from too few patients leading to low revenues. 
“But these are unique circumstances in every rural part of the country,” Crapo said, “and each one is slightly different, but there are different reasons for each and one of the reasons we give this money to the states is so that they can fine tune how it is utilized in those regions and for those hospitals that are really facing the trouble.” 
CMS is expected to provide states guidance for applying to grant money next week, Whitlock said, and it is expected applications will be due by November. Approval will be provided by Dec. 31.

Miller's mythical cowboys have a little fun translating Wyoming ranch listings.
The post Real estate porn around the ol’ campfire appeared first on WyoFile .","Days are getting shorter, and nightfall comes sooner in the old cow camp this time of year. Bone-weary drovers sit around the ol’ campfire after a tough day on the trail. The desultory conversation seems to wander, until Sweetwater Slim pipes up and says, “Saaay, didja hear that the Slash V outfit just got sold? Some bitcoin zillionaire paid 40 million bucks fer that sorry piece o’ country.”

Opinion

“Hell’s bells!” interjected Sourdough. “Them poor Slash V cows spend their lives at a trot, goin’ from one blade o’ grass t’other, tryin’ to stay alive. Forty million bucks?”
“There’s a lotta that new money floatin’ around,” offered Slim, “an’ a lotta city fellers wantin’ to be John Wayne an’ own a Yellowstone o’ their own. They’s just a’slobberin’ over any ranch that comes on the market.”
“An’ there’s a passel o’ them ol’ cow outfits hittin’ the market these days fer serious money.” This from Panhandle, who pulled a dog-eared Sotheby’s catalog from his chap pocket. He brought a coal-oil lamp to the fire and displayed the glossy brochure. “Lookee here, pards,” he said. “There’s a couple dozen o’ them ol’ ranches right here in the Big Empty fer sale.” He opened the thick Sotheby’s catalog to the fold-out scratch-n-sniff centerfold and passed it around to his amigos.
Murmurs of “oooh” and “ahhhh” were heard from the campfire smoke, as the cowboys thumbed through the old Wyoming ranches offered for sale in amounts up to nine figures. They’d worked these outfits, knew them well and were taken aback by the prices and the carefully airbrushed photos and florid prose that described these places.
“Lemme see that.” Cookie grabbed the catalog and turned a few pages. “My nephew works for one o’ them big brokers in Jackson Hole, and he writes this stuff purely to sell ranches to city dudes. He says iff’n ya cain’t sell profit potential, ya gotta sell the purty.” Stetsons nodded at this wisdom. “An’ he says ya gotta invent a new language to do it, he calls it real estate porn. It’s like a code.”
Puzzled glances met Cookie’s words.
Cookie tossed the catalog to Goshen Gus and said, “Read me somethin’ from one o’ them ads, an’ I’ll translate it for ya.”

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Gus squinted, ran his finger down a page and read, “Enjoy unparalleled solitude and privacy on your own little slice of western heaven.”
Cookie thought a moment, then said, “First off, ‘little slice’ means it ain’t no bigger’n a wrangle pasture. An’ the rest of it means yer livin’ thirty miles from town down a washed out road, and ya cain’t get off the place in the winter.”
Gus handed the glossy catalog to Deacon from Dayton, who read, “well-watered with sub-irrigated meadows.”
“That un’ easy,” exclaimed Cookie. “What they’re really sayin’ is that the mosquitoes an’ deerflies’ll suck you dry o’ blood iff’n you step outside the house in summer.”
Little Joe the Wrangler read over Deacon’s shoulder and said, “How ‘bout this, ‘An uninterrupted, 360-degree view of wild Wyoming splendor.”
Cookie interpreted, “That place is somewhere in the Red Desert, an’ their ain’t a tree tall enough to block yer view of all them rattlesnakes an’ sagebrush. That there’s a good example o’ fine real estate porn.”
Houlihan grabbed the brochure and read, “a stone’s throw from world-class, blue ribbon trout fishing.”
Cookie waved his greasy cook spoon and said, “That’s real estate porn fer ‘the river is on yer neighbor’s land, an’ he’ll shoot ya iff’n ya try to wet a line.’ See how this works?”
“Ok, Cookie. Iff’n yer so smart, what does this mean?” Powder River Pete taunted, then read, “Room for a man of the West to stretch his legs and get a good, old-fashioned feel for the countryside.”
“Think about it,” Cookie replied. “That means no indoor plumbin’ an’ the outhouse is a quarter mile away from the cabin. Next.”
The Sotheby’s catalog was back in Panhandle’s grip now, and he read, “Thousand-year-old petroglyphs stand guard along your clear mountain creek, speaking ancient native wisdom to those who listen.”
Cookie regarded Panhandle and said, “Pard, you an’ I have worked that ranch, an’ we know what those petroglyphs along Difficulty Creek are sayin’. They say ‘This water will give you the runs. Don’t drink it.”
Panhandle closed the brochure, the campfire light sputtered and Cookie said, “Speakin’ o’ runs, who’s ready fer some beans?”

They are continuing to obsess about the past and the good work that we have done.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Assembly Republicans announced a broad education agenda Tuesday along with a set of task forces. The slate of proposals they plan to advance this fall includes one to encourage school district consolidation and one to push Gov. Tony Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, though exact bill details were scant. Among the new task forces is one that pursues goals similar to those of a Republican committee established this year to improve government efficiency.
As Wisconsin lawmakers return from their summer break, they are beginning to roll out their goals for the rest of the legislative session through early 2026. Democratic lawmakers have also been rolling out  bills, including a package to cancel Walker-era labor laws and one that would reauthorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rocherster) knocked Democrats’ proposals at the press conference Tuesday. 
“I’ve been watching over the course of the past several weeks as my Democratic colleagues have been talking about what they would like to accomplish this fall and the vast majority of things they’ll be introducing are repealing some good things that we have done,” Vos said. “They are not really focusing on the future. They are continuing to obsess about the past and the good work that we have done. Unlike where our Democratic colleagues are, we’re really looking at the issues that are important to the entire state of Wisconsin.” 
Republicans’ education proposals seek to address a number of issues.
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said new GOP legislation seeks to help address financial issues school districts are facing by encouraging them to look at consolidating and sharing services. 
Currently, there are 421 public school districts across the state. Nedweski said that given declining enrollment, that number may need to be cut. 
“We have lost 53,000 students over the last decade,” Nedweski said, “Because student enrollment is the primary driver of our state’s school funding formula, districts experiencing declining enrollment receive less money in state aid.” 
As state support for education has declined, Wisconsin school districts have increasingly had to go to referendum to ask for additional funding from local property taxpayers. Public school advocates blame record-breaking  referendum drives on state funding not keeping pace with inflation. During the most recent state budget, Democrats and advocates called for additional per pupil funding for public schools, but Republicans rejected it and provided no increase to schools’ general state aid.
“Democrats might argue that the solution is something to throw more money at the problem, but it does not solve the issue that there are just less kids being born today than there were 20 years ago,” Nedweski said. “It’s a birth rate issue as enrollment continues to decline, especially in smaller rural districts. Many schools will face difficult decisions, and our goal is to provide support and give tools, remove barriers, and create incentives for voluntary consolidation.”
Nedweski argued that consolidation would help address the “cycle of referendum.” 
She pointed to her own district as an example, saying she has seven single-school K-8 school districts and two school districts that are high schools. 
“That’s a lot of administrative costs and a lot of redundant services and money being spent that couldn’t be going to teachers and into the classroom, so many of them have gone to referendum over the last couple of years, some have been successful, some have failed,” Nedweski said. “We’re seeing a failure rate increase and consolidation cases like these could lower overhead, reduce costs and allow schools to serve students more efficiently and more effectively.” 
She said the specifics of the financial incentives are still being worked out, but will include providing state funds to help consolidating districts equalize their mill rates if they vary, a grant program for school districts exploring consolidation and potentially a policy related to “grade sharing,” among two or more school districts. 
“We are still sort of polishing up some of this policy that we really have taken input from people all around the state from administrators, even educators,” Nedweski said. 
A bill from Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) will instruct Evers to opt into a new federal school choice tax credit program. 
A provision in the federal law signed by Trump in July and that goes into effect in 2027, will provide a dollar-to-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support taxpayer-financed private-school vouchers. Governors have until Jan. 1, 2027 to opt into the program.
“This program isn’t about one educational school,” Rodriguez said. “Instead, it helps public, private, charter and even homeschool families access the tools they need to help their kids succeed.”
Rodriguez noted that the scholarships can be used for tutoring, transportation costs, supplemental courses and other costs. 
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Evers has already said he will not opt Wisconsin into the program. If the bill were passed by the Senate and Assembly instructing Evers to take action, he could veto the legislation. 
Rodriguez called on Evers to reconsider.
“He claims that opting our state in would be ‘catastrophic’ to public schools, but the federal tax credit can benefit students in private and public schools alike,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “Having Wisconsin join this federal program should be a slam dunk!… This is a chance to bring more resources into our classrooms — public, private, rural and urban — to help our children succeed.”
Teachers Bill of Rights and other bills
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) is authoring a bill that would implement a “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” that he said would seek to ensure teachers have recourses when  students exhibit disruptive or violent behavior. The language of the bill isn’t yet available.
“Every teacher needs to be safe in his or her classroom, so there needs to be a policy in place,” Penterman said. “What is the recourse if I, as a teacher, send a student away for some sort of violent, disruptive behavior? Teachers and administration need to be on the exact same page. We’re still finalizing some of the details, so I look forward to sharing the final bill with you when it comes out.” 
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) said lawmakers will try to help address disparities in math performance by passing legislation similar to a new reading instruction law, but for math. He said the bill will seek to implement screeners to help catch students who are struggling early and put them on an individualized plan to help catch them up. 
“This bill is not going to be the full solution to the problem, but I think it’s a very good first step,” Kitchens said.
Kitchens said he also plans to introduce a bill to ban drones from flying over schools without written permission from school administrators following some complaints from constituents.  
“This is both a safety and a privacy issue,” Kitchens said. 
Another bill from Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville) seeks to make it easier for students to participate in college dual enrollment courses. 
Vos said the bills do not negate Wisconsin’s local control policies for school districts. 
“We always stood strongly in favor of that, but there are some statewide standards,” Vos said. “As an example, if you look at protecting teachers, I think that’s very easy for us to say. It doesn’t matter if you teach in Milwaukee or Burlington, River Falls or Rice Lake, you should have the same protections to ensure that if a disruptive student happens at your school where it’s taking its division and that they’re standing behind you.”
Vos said that the goal of his caucus is to release bill drafts over the next two weeks, then move them through the public hearing process in time to be considered during an October floor session. 
The bills would also need to advance in the Senate.
“We are the ones who work a little bit faster in the Assembly, but an awful lot of things become  law because of our partnership with the state Senate…  I am extremely confident by February, when we adjourn, we will have produced a good package of bills we can all stand behind,” Vos said. 
Speakers’ task forces 
The lawmakers also announced the creation of four bipartisan task forces by Vos, including one focused on protecting children online, one seeking to make state government more efficient using artificial intelligence, one to better elder services and one that will explore how to rework the state’s rulemaking process after a recent state Supreme Court ruling took away some of lawmakers’ power to block rules. 
The task forces will meet this fall with the goal of wrapping up their work by the end of the year.
The rulemaking task force will be chaired by Rep. Brent Jacobson (R-Mosinee). He said the task force will seek to identify agencies with broad rulemaking powers that may be “better left to the Legislature,” to strengthen standing committee review of rules and to write a constitutional amendment proposal that will reimplement the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR). 
Jacobson said the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s Evers v. Marklein II decision in July — which found that state laws giving JCRAR broad powers to block administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional — was a “180-turn” on the rulemaking process. 
The Evers administration has  taken steps after the ruling to implement rules without the approval of legislative committees. Republican lawmakers have, in turn, tried to block the implementation of the rules, including a committee last week calling on the Evers administration to drop a proposed rule language change that would replace the phrases “mother” and “woman” with “member” and “father” with “other parent.”
Jacobson made an appeal to Democrats, noting the Evers will not be in office come 2027. 
“There could be a Republican in the governor’s office after next year’s election, and this topic could be one of Democrats’ top priorities next session,” Jacobson said. “With an open governor’s race, we have an opportunity for a bipartisan revamp of the way we hold bureaucrats accountable in Wisconsin.” 
Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston) will chair a task force dedicated to looking at elder services. Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) will chair a task force on “protecting kids.”
“We face a rising youth mental health crisis in our state. We recognize that social media and unrestricted access to the internet has opened a deep chasm into our family structure and filled it with mindless or even dangerous content,” Brill said. “As so many forces try to rip families apart and divide them from each other, we have an obligation to work diligently to keep families together, connected, informed and strong.”
Rep. Jim Piwowarczyk (R – Hubertus) will chair a task force on government efficiency and modernization. It is different from, though related to, a committee formed in the last legislative session that mirrored the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Wisconsin’s version is called the Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency Committee (GOAT). 
The Speaker’s Task Force on Government Efficiency and Modernization will specifically look at ways to replace outdated processes with modern tools, reduce administrative overhead through automation, integrate systems and use data to predict demand and allocate resources more effectively. 
The GOAT Committee also has a goal of working to eliminate government inefficiency.

Idaho is planning to apply to the Rural Health Transformation Fund, a $50 billion five-year fund created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed into law this year by congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, has said the state could receive $100 million each year from the fund over its five years, calling it “arguably the single largest investment in rural health care in more than 20 years.”
He pushed for several aspects of the bill, which also deeply cuts spending for public assistance programs, including Medicaid. 
The public can submit input to shape Idaho’s application online through a survey until Sept. 30 at https://app.keysurvey.com/f/41795757/170f/.
“Input from rural health care providers, hospitals, clinics, community organizations, payers, workforce entities, universities, tribal nations, associations, local governments, and the public is critical to guiding the department’s application for funding and how this funding may be best used to serve rural Idaho communities,” Health and Welfare officials said in a news release. 
Survey responses are a public record, and officials suggest people don’t submit sensitive or confidential information.

Vice chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, Pody said he wants to make sure the proposed tunnel doesn’t cause environmental or utility problems, but he’s also interested in Boring directing it to the Hermitage/Donelson area where parking is available for the Music City Star, a train that runs into downtown Nashville. He would like to see it extend, as well, to the East Bank where the state is involved with Metro Nashville in a massive development of the Titans stadium, Tennessee Performing Arts Center, Oracle headquarters and housing.
Besides responding to Pody, the Boring Company answered some 70 questions by Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office, saying it would obtain Metro and state permits for the underground project and use backup emergency services measures for safety.

The loop, costing a few hundred million dollars in private funding, would use parallel tunnels to all locations so vehicles could travel in each direction, according to the responses. Any fees the company would pay to the state or Metro remain under negotiations.
The mayor’s office is reviewing the responses and expects to follow up with the Boring Company to get a better understanding of the potential impact on Nashville residents, according to spokesperson Julie Oaks Smith.
Despite the company’s assurances and Pody’s acceptance, Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville continues to oppose the plan, calling the process “outrageous” and saying no impact study has been completed in advance of the work.
Regardless of whether the project turns out to be good for the area, the state hasn’t considered the views of Nashville residents, she said. 
The State Building Commission Executive Subcommittee held a public hearing more than a month ago, taking comments from the public, but held little discussion before approving a no-cost lease of a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol for Boring to launch its tunnel-digging equipment.
“It’s indicative of a larger trend nationally with the government we’re seeing that disregards the democratic process, and that to me is one of the most alarming parts of it,” Campbell said.
The project also provides one more example of the state government favoring large corporations over public interests, Campbell said.
The state of Tennessee plans to sign a long-term lease with Boring for occupancy and operations on state right of way that would go through the state’s excess land process, which requires approval by the Federal Highway Administration, according to Department of Transportation spokesperson Beth Emmons.
The Boring Company has announced its plan to apply for a permit with the Department of Transportation, which has to be reviewed to determine whether the permit is applicable, Emmons said. The state tailors permits based on each project.
Nashville mayor’s office queries Boring Company about tunnel plan

“This being a first-of-its-kind project, we expect this request would result in an enhanced grading permit to address the large scope of work and that may require additional information and requirements of the permittee to ensure all state interests are maintained throughout construction,” Emmons said.
Responding to Metro
The Boring Company last week sent O’Connell’s office responses to a multitude of questions.

For emergency vehicle access during and after construction, Nashville tunnels will be designed to meet national transit standards that require exit spacing up to 2,500 feet. Emergency vehicles would access the same portals as Tesla vehicles used in the loop.
Music City Loop would comply with authorities that have jurisdiction over life safety. The company met with the State Fire Marshal’s Office and Nashville Fire Department and invited them to visit the Vegas Loop to see life safety systems at work.
Tunnels would have “redundant” communication systems for 911 calls and responders, enabling coordination between emergency services workers and dispatchers above ground, all meeting national requirements. Passengers and responders could make 911 calls four ways: at blue light stations, directly from cell phones, through vehicles or by an operations control center.
Tunnels will have space for passengers and employees to get in and out of vehicles in an emergency. Vegas Loop tunnels have nearly 3 feet between the vehicle’s side mirror and wall.
In case of a vehicle battery fire — Tesla reports 232 confirmed battery fires — a ventilation system will send smoke and hazardous gases toward outlets.
To keep people out of the tunnel, access points would have secure gates, controlled station entrances and camera coverage without blind spots. In case a person entered without permission, an operations control center or automated systems would alert security and trigger a red tunnel light prompting drivers to stop until the person is removed.
Similarly to the Vegas Loop, Music City Loop tunnels would be watertight using gaskets to seal joints and a 3-inch layer of grout sealant outside the tunnel. If water gets into the system, high-power sump pumps would force it out.
Music City Loop insurance would meet and exceed requirements specified in permits and state law, and the company would be responsible for injuries caused by its operations.
Long-term ownership of the tunnel is being reviewed and is to be released to the public when final.
Maintenance and upkeep is to be privately funded and subject to terms of the state lease agreement.
The project is undergoing utility review to avoid conflicts. Music City Loop will pay for relocating utilities and adhere to permitting processes.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) On Wednesday, The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced an additional $1.5 million investment into Virginia’s state elections this year. 
While the organization typically supports legislative candidates in states around the country, this year it is also boosting Virginia lieutenant governor candidate Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield. Lieutenant governors preside over the state Senate and become an extension of the legislature when they need to cast tie-breaking votes. 
Hashmi expressed gratitude in a statement to The Mercury for DLCC’s work to “support Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.” 
The new cash infusion is part of DLCC’s ongoing seven-figure investment in Virginia to help protect or expand Democrats’ majority. This year, all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are up for election, with Democrats running in every district.
Democrats reach historic goal: A full slate in Virginia House races

Over past two decades, Virginia has typically elected a governor from the opposite party that won the White House the year before, with those gains trickling into legislative races and even local contests. This track record gives Democrats an edge this year, but Republicans hope to break the cycle. 
A handful of seats are typically deemed most competitive each year; this time, DLCC is also spotlighting other district seats that pundits suspect could be flippable for the party. 
House District 64 Democratic nominee Stacey Carroll, is running for such a seat and is included in the latest round of candidate spotlights from DLCC.  The district, currently represented by Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, leans Republican. In last year’s presidential election, that margin was under 2 points, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 
Carroll said she’s not focused on partisanship when she’s door-knocking.
“I talk to people about government,” she said. “Not about a specific party, but specific policies and how those would impact people.”
She’s interested in low-propensity voters — people who might be motivated to cast their ballot because of certain policies, rather than an “R” or “D” behind the candidates’ name.
Carroll and Milde’s district, and others in Northern Virginia, have been home to a sizable population of federal workers. Thousands around the state having been laid off this year by President Donald Trump’s administration. It’s one issue Carroll has encountered while campaigning.
“As I’m on the doors, one of the sentiments that I hear through and through is that government is just not working for the average American and a resident of here,” Carroll said.
As she courts voters in an area that has often had a Republican lean, funding boosts from national groups can help her campaign, and others’.
While DLCC has always supported state legislature contests, the Democratic National Committee announced efforts this spring to further bolster state parties’ organizing. The focus on state-level gains is important for the party’s national apparatus and candidate pipelines, DNC chair Ken Martin emphasized on a press call in April. 
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” he said. 
Retaining or growing Democratic majorities is also paramount to advancing three constitutional amendments that have mostly fallen on party lines. 
One measure would automatically restore voting rights for ex-felons who have completed their sentences, and another would enshrine same-sex marriage protections should fedreal protections end. Both measures received bipartisan support, albeit primarily from Democrats. 
The third amendment would enshrine reproductive rights into the state constitution, which every Republican has voted against. 
All three measures must pass again in 2026 before they could end up on ballots for voters statewide to approve or reject. 
“These elections couldn’t be more important, which is why the DLCC is all hands on deck to fuel these winning campaigns through Election Day,” DLCC president Heather Williams said in a statement. 
Williams will be in Richmond this coming Saturday for an in-person meet-and-greet with candidates in competitive districts in Central Virginia. 
Countering DLCC, the Republican State Leadership Committee announced a $2 million investment in canvassing efforts for Virginia and New Jersey elections this summer and funded targeted advertisements earlier this year.

(Photo: Getty Images)Rarely do we think about who owns the local television stations licensed to serve our communities, but a recent proposed merger of two big TV owners would have huge implications for Tennessee and the rest of the nation. The plan also demonstrates the folly of excessive deregulation allowing for the growth of media behemoths.
When you watch CBS programming on WREG in Memphis, you are not watching a CBS-owned station. That station is owned by Nexstar, a huge media player that currently owns or operates more than 200 television stations, reaching more than 212 million people across 116 markets. Nexstar simply has a business deal to carry CBS programs into the Memphis market — by its transmitter tower using the public airwaves, or indirectly by others bringing it into your home by satellite, fiber optic cable or wireless distribution.
The ABC affiliate in Memphis (WATN) and the NBC affiliate in Knoxville (WBIR) both are owned and operated by Tegna, a chain of 64 stations in 51 U. S. markets, spun off from Gannett in 2015. Nexstar now has declared it wants to buy out Tegna. That would put the two previously mentioned Memphis stations under the same ownership; it would do the same in Knoxville with WBIR and ABC affiliate WATE.
This level of concentration almost by definition will harm the competitiveness of the local TV advertising market and public service. When newsrooms merge or disappear, we as audience members lose because there are fewer reporters and producers suggesting, researching, and presenting news accounts of local events in Memphis, Knoxville, and in many other spots around the nation.
Scott Barker of Knoxville’s online news site Compass also pointed out the harm to local broadcast employees. He wrote, “[T]he prospect of becoming Nexstar employees may not fill WBIR staff with glee. The company is notorious in the industry for low wages.”
A recent report from the National Association of Broadcast Employees & Technicians found that the “majority (62%) of Nexstar workers earn less than a living wage for their metro area for a single person without children and 89% earn less than a living wage for their metro area for a single person with one child.”
The same report declared that “Nexstar pays 22% less than the median wage, on average, for the most common occupations surveyed. Workers report that they have to skip breaks and often work in understaffed departments. Meanwhile, Nexstar is very profitable and seeks to grow through more acquisitions of local broadcast stations.”
To make its acquisitions possible, Nexstar wants to waive or eliminate the few remaining Federal Communications Commission rules limiting concentration of ownership. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals this past summer threw out one FCC rule blocking one owner from acquiring two of the top four stations in any market. The FCC still has a rule that caps a single broadcast owner from controlling stations whose combined signals reach more than 39% of the U.S. population. The FCC, however, is in the middle of administrative procedures to wipe out that limit, effectively doing the bidding of Nexstar whose $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna would leave the combined company reaching 80% of U.S. households.
Another cautionary Tennessee story about concentrated ownership also can be demonstrated through Sinclair Broadcast Group. It owns Fox affiliate WZTV in Nashville, plus both WRCB (NBC) and WTVC (ABC/Fox) in Chattanooga. It also owns WCYB (NBC) in the Tri-Cities market (Johnson City, Kingsport, Bristol) and operates the Fox affiliate there for another company.
Sinclair is a very large owner/operator of TV licenses in the U.S. The latest tally is 185 stations in 85 markets. Most local TV news is remarkably apolitical. Station ownership is more interested in the green of profitability than red v. blue political disputes. Sinclair, however, is a big player in extreme right-wing politics.
During the 2016 campaign, Sinclair, in a deal trumpeted by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, ordered its stations to run more favorable stories about then-candidate Donald Trump. Sinclair went through a period of “must-run” commentaries from Trump operative Boris Epshteyn. Sinclair also insists its newsrooms air material on conspiracies like the “deep state”’ and voice warnings about “fake news.” More recently, Nexstar has mandated its stations run stories pushing broadcast deregulation.
Sinclair’s duplicity was exposed dramatically in 2018 when Deadspin put together a video of dozens of Sinclair anchors reading word-for-word a required commentary slamming other news outlets for pushing personal bias.
Broadcast station owners for years have crusaded against nearly all regulation. They note that no such regulation exists for newspapers, magazines, online forums or sites. Anyone can start a news web site and many of us would be repulsed at the First Amendment complications of restricting who could. TV stations, however, have made billions over decades using a limited scarce public resource, public airwaves. It isn’t too much to insist that they owe some minimal obligations to those of us without access to such airwaves. That can include technical standards for signal strength, but also some ownership limits so this valuable public resource is not swallowed up by a handful of operators. The cheapness of Nexstar and the partisanship of Sinclair only serve to highlight the obvious dangers.
Tennesseans with concerns can call or write the FCC to comment about the FCC keeping its limits on the percentage of U.S. audience any one station owner may reach.  It’s a matter that stretches from Memphis to Knoxville in terms of constricting the number of voices operating television stations.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The amount of money Louisiana state government spent on information technology products and services increased dramatically over three budget cycles, from July 2021 to June 2024. 

Louisiana state agencies went from spending $554.4 million with the Office of Technology Services in fiscal year 2022 to spending $652.5 million in fiscal year 2024, according to a report the Louisiana Legislative Auditor released this week. That’s an increase of $98 million (18%) over three years. 

Five state agencies that saw the largest surge in spending on IT services:

Louisiana Department of Health, $34.2 million (24.5%) 
Department of Children and FamilServices, $14.5 million (15.9%)
Secretary of State, $1.5 million (55%)
Department of Corrections, $7.7 increase (47%) 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, $3 million (41%)

Some of the agencies with large increases went through well publicized technology upgrades. 
The Department of Children and Family Services, which went from spending $91.4 million in fiscal year 2022 to $105.9 million in fiscal year 2024, has started to upgrade its system so its records can be digitized and its operations can be improved. The Department of Corrections and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries have made similar change. 

The Secretary of State attributes its increase in IT expenses – which went from $2.7 million in fiscal year 2022 to $4.2 million in fiscal year 2024 – to printing and mailing letters to voters about the new congressional and Louisiana Supreme Court districts in 2024. The effort was handled, in part, by the state Office of Technology Services. 

The Department of Health attributed the hike in its technology budget – which went from $139.6 million in fiscal year 2022 to $173.8 million in fiscal year 2024 – to the culling of the Medicaid rolls following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
State officials said existing technology had to be updated in order to drop people from Medicaid enrollment who were no longer entitled to the coverage following the end of the COVID-19 emergency. The federal government required people who were at risk of being removed from the program to be contacted in several different manners, which was also handled by the Office of Technology Services.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-10 06:56:37.050808

(Photo courtesy of NDSU)Representatives of North Dakota’s two largest universities say Trump administration efforts to curb federal spending have already cost the state millions in research funding — and their institutions expect to lose millions more in the coming years.
The executive branch is attempting to slash research spending by terminating existing  grants and appropriating less money for research in the upcoming budget.
Scott Snyder, the University of North Dakota’s vice president for research, told a legislative committee on Aug. 21 that the Trump budget proposal cuts research funding from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation by 50%.
“Big time cuts,” Snyder said. 
Snyder and Heidi Grunwald, interim vice president for research at North Dakota State University, pointed to an Aug. 7 executive order from President Donald Trump titled “Improving oversight of federal grantmaking” with several stipulations on which grants can be approved. 
Grunwald said the order will likely mean fewer grant opportunities and could slow the release of money. 
“It could have devastating effects on total awards for 2026,” Grunwald said during the Legislature’s Higher Education Institutions Committee meeting in Dickinson, North Dakota. 
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

Trump’s executive order is critical of National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation research. It said one 2024 study claimed that more than one-quarter of new National Science Foundation grants “went to diversity, equity, and inclusion and other far-left initiatives.” It did not name the study. 
It also noted that a “substantial portion” of some grants goes to university facilities and administrative costs.
“Awards must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities,” the order stated, and can’t promote “anti-American values.” 
Grant cancellations
UND has already had eight awards canceled, resulting in the loss of more than $3 million, mostly from the Department of Health and Human Services, Snyder said. This includes three National Institutes of Health grants. 
One funded a program called U-RISE, which trained eight undergraduate students to become biomedical researchers. 
The program provided students with a stipend for their work, though that money dried up in February when NIH canceled the grant, Snyder told the North Dakota Monitor. UND lost roughly $900,000 that it expected to receive over the next three years for the program.
“My office went ahead and covered their pay for the rest of the semester,” Snyder said in an interview. “We wanted to make sure that these students had a way to eat, they had a way to drive their cars.”
UND also lost a little less than $150,000 in grant money from the NIH for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health Equity Ambassador program, which “supports CDC employees in sharing information about public health careers and promoting healthy behaviors,” according to the university.
The NIH also terminated a grant that supported mentorship and training opportunities for predoctoral students. The award — which funded a graduate student’s research on breast cancer — was in its last year, so UND did not lose any money from the cancellation, according to the school.
Keeping the lights on
Snyder and Grunwald told lawmakers about the impact of potential changes on facilities and administrative costs that federal funding will cover. 
Universities negotiate how much money can be applied to keep the lights on, keep buildings maintained and pay for some salaries for people not directly involved in research, such as custodians and finance staff. 
Grunwald said the Trump administration is trying to cap the rate at 15%. 
UND calculated the potential loss at $15 million per year; NDSU’s estimate was $9 million per year. 
Snyder said there is more than $1 million at risk in funding for the Energy and Environmental Research Center and the College of Engineering and Mines at UND.  
“The Department of Energy is where we’re having our biggest challenges in getting the money to flow,” Snyder told committee members. 
Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

EERC Director Charles Gorecki said in an interview that the Department of Energy is slow to announce new projects. 
Snyder told the legislative committee that UND is 30% to 40% behind the pace of federally funded projects compared with last year. 
Grunwald said NDSU, in fiscal year 2024, had 799 awards worth $142 million, and that dropped to 693 awards worth $92 million in fiscal year 2025.
“This is in part due to inaction by agencies from January 2025 to the present,” she said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture research funding is shrinking, Grunwald said, but the tax break and spending cut measure that Republicans call the “big, beautiful bill” does have money for agricultural research facilities like NDSU through the USDA. 
Snyder said there is some reason for optimism. Members of some Senate subcommittees are pushing back on research cuts and trying to keep funding rate for facilities and administrative costs flat. 
 “The 15% would be very damaging to our institutions,” Snyder said.

Mensah killed Cole on Feb. 2 2020 following a foot pursuit at Mayfair Mall, during which Mensah said Cole pointed a gun […]","The federal courthouse in Milwaukee.A federal civil trial over the killing of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by then-Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah entered its second day Tuesday, with testimony from the medical examiner, police investigators and Mensah himself. Mensah killed Cole on Feb. 2 2020 following a foot pursuit at Mayfair Mall, during which Mensah said Cole pointed a gun at him. 
Dr. Weislaw Tlomak, chief medical examiner in Milwaukee County, performed the autopsy of Cole’s body the morning after he was killed. Using diagrams and a manikin , she described in detail the gunshot wounds Cole sustained after running from police in the Mayfair Mall parking lot. 
One of the most discussed wounds on Cole’s body was a gunshot wound to his forearm. Tlomak explained that it came from a shot at close range. 
Attorneys representing the Cole family argued that Cole shot himself in the arm as he ran, causing him to fall to the ground. Cole’s other wounds were also discussed in detail, with autopsy photos shown to the jury for the first time. When the case first went to trial in March, ending in a hung jury, autopsy photos were not shown. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As Tlomak testified, U.S. Marshals streamed in and out of the courtroom, their presence more noticeable than on Monday. At one point during testimony, four fully uniformed Wauwatosa officers sat on the far side of the courtroom in full view of the jury. One of them sat next to Mensah’s wife, herself a former Milwaukee police officer. At least one of the officers, Ralph Salyers, had been on the scene of Mensah’s second shooting in 2016 of Jay Anderson Jr., and was offered immunity by special prosecutors in 2021 when that shooting was re-examined under the state’s John Doe laws. The officers sat for hours listening to testimony. Cole was the third person killed by Mensah during his five years at Wauwatosa PD. 
Milwaukee police detective Lori Rom, who served as part of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team in 2020, testified, “Everybody sees and hears stuff different.” Rom and her partner William Schroeder, with whom she helped investigate the Cole shooting, said they were unable to talk to Mensah or officer Evan Olson, who’d left the scene and had to be interviewed with their lawyers. 
Both detectives testified that officers involved in fatal incidents need to be separated in order to avoid contaminating or influencing statements. Rom and Schroeder testified that officers should know better than to talk to each other. Both detectives admitted that they were surprised to learn from plaintiff attorneys on Tuesday that Mensah and Olson had gone off in a squad car together, and that Olson may have even driven Mensah back to the police department. “I would be surprised,” said Rom. “That’s typically not what you’re supposed to do. They should know not to do that.” No officer or supervisor told the investigators that officers hadn’t been separated, an important detail both Rom and Schroeder said they expected their colleagues to share with them.
Rom and Schroeder both said that no officers reached out to them to say that their reports were inaccurate after reviewing them. Their interviews with officers were not recorded, a common practice of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team. Schroeder testified that an attorney from the Cermele Law Office, who regularly represented police officers, refused to allow his clients to be recorded.
Attorneys attempted to read other officer interviews from the Cole shooting investigation, but were struck down by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelmen, who agreed with defense attorneys that the reports were hearsay. One of those reports described a Wauwatosa officer, Maria Albiter, who was approached by Olson as she sat with Mensah, and told that he would sit with the officer instead.  
Plaintiff attorneys played sections of squad car video which captured Mensah and Olson going to a squad car together before deactivating the video and both of their lapel microphones. In another clip, Shamsi can be heard talking to Wauwatosa officer Dexter Schleis about the shooting, with plaintiff attorney’s posing that Schleis can be heard promising not to tell anyone that they talked at the end. When Schleis, who is still a Wauwatosa officer, later took the stand and heard the clip, he denied having said that.

A major issue in the case is the contradicting statements between Shamsi, Olson, and Mensah. Whereas Shamsi was closest to Cole when he was shot and said the teen’s gun hadn’t moved at all, Olson and Mensah said that Cole raised the gun at each of them. Olson and Mensah were on opposite ends of the parking lot. Plaintiff attorneys argue that the gun couldn’t have been pointed at them both, while Mensah’s defense attorneys suggested in opening statements Monday that Cole pointed the gun at both officers. 
Mensah himself took the stand Tuesday afternoon. As in the last trial, he answered many questions asked by plaintiff attorneys with “I don’t remember” or “I don’t recall”. Mensah testified that after hearing the first gunshot as he chased Cole, he pulled out his own weapon. When Mensah saw a gun in Cole’s hand, he tensed his body and prepared to be shot, he said, describing it as a sort of “burning” sensation and fear. 
“It’s dark, it’s a stressful situation,” said Mensah. “Just because I remember one thing doesn’t mean I’ll remember another.” Yet the muzzle of Cole’s gun was something that Mensah testified that he won’t forget. “It’s not just me I’m protecting,” said Mensah. “It’s everyone else there as well.”
Mensah said that he fired until he felt the threat had been stopped, and that after the shooting he was very distraught and crying. Olson came to comfort him, and although Mensah said he couldn’t remember aspects of their time together, he told the jury that the two did not talk about the shooting at all. Mensah also couldn’t recall why his video and audio stopped once the two got into the car together. Mensah said he didn’t understand why Cole didn’t stop and drop the gun. “I didn’t want to get shot,” said Mensah. “I didn’t want to die.”
The day ended with testimony from Ricky Burems, a former Milwaukee police detective with 32 years experience, and Schleis. Burems spoke about his experience with Defense and Arrest Tactics (DAAT), a standardized use of force training police officers in most states including Wisconsin receive.

DAAT should be interpreted as what a hypothetical reasonable officer with the same training would do, Burems testified, adding  that even when deadly force is used, the purpose is not to kill someone but to stop an imminent threat. Dialogue, not deadly force, is emphasized in DAAT training, Burems testified. If an officer fires, then after each shot is taken an officer needs to re-evaluate whether the threat still exists, he said. When firing, an officer must also consider what is beyond his target, such as civilians or other officers who may be struck. When questioned by defense attorneys, he said that although he’s trained many officers over his career, that he is not a certified DAAT instructor, and that there are circumstances where officers may rely on deadly force immediately. 
The day ended with Schleis, one of the officers who responded to Mayfair Mall in 2020, recounting how he arrived at the mall, responding to a call about a disorderly suspect who may have had a gun. Officers encountered a group of teens outside the mall, one of whom matched the description of the subject they were looking for. The group ran. Schelis was arresting one of the teens when he heard the first shot go off, followed by several more. Schleis, like other officers, testified that foot chases are remarkably unpredictable and dangerous. Asked about talking to other officers on scene, he denied telling Shamsi that he wouldn’t tell anyone that they’d talked, something plaintiff attorneys argued was captured on camera. 
By the end of the day, the four Wauwatosa officers who’d watched portions of the trial left and Wauwatosa PD Captain Luke Vetter arrived to watch testimony from the gallery, wearing a civilian suit with a badge on the breast pocket. Plaintiff attorneys rested their case Tuesday, with more witnesses expected to be called by the defense Wednesday before the case is handed over to the jury.

An anxious mom or dad taking an equally anxious young child to the bus stop or all the way to school for the very first time. Tears are shed, hugs are held a little longer, and soon, their little one is off to face the unknown.
This year, about 100 Idaho families will take their young child to a doctor’s office or the hospital to also face a different unknown. Data suggests that about 100 Idaho children will be diagnosed with cancer this year – most likely leukemia or lymphoma. In 2023, 10 Idaho children did not survive their battle with cancer.
These Idaho ‘angels’ provide a cancer support service where it counts

In 1990, President George H.W. Bush established September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This month is dedicated to raising awareness about childhood cancer, supporting families affected by the disease, and advocating for research and treatment advancements.
Since 1969, Idaho hospitals have collaborated with the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho to collect and curate information about cancer diagnosed among Idaho residents – including children. This is possible thanks to funding from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Idaho Legislature, and the Idaho Hospital Association.
Remarkable progress has been made in treating pediatric cancer over the last 50 years. Today, 9 in 10 Idaho children diagnosed with cancer are still alive five years after their diagnosis, and more than half of Idaho children with cancer are enrolled in a clinical trial through an Idaho hospital.  
Still, rates of malignant melanoma in Idaho kids are among the highest in the country. Forty percent of Idaho children diagnosed with malignant melanoma are younger than 15 years old. Melanoma is one cancer that is largely preventable simply by using sun protection. The Society for Pediatric Dermatology recommends sun-protective clothing and broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher be used to protect kids from harmful UV rays. 
The effects of pediatric cancer can last a lifetime. The Cancer Data Registry of Idaho’s most recent report states, “Studies show that adult survivors of childhood cancer are more likely to have adverse health outcomes later in life. They are at risk for higher health care expenditures and lost productivity, compared to adults without a history of childhood cancer. Education, intervention programs, and ongoing follow-up care are important for improving health and economic outcomes associated with cancer survivorship in this population.” 
Idaho’s hospitals are committed to helping raise awareness about childhood cancer. Our goal, and the goal of the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho, is to support the research that benefits families in their individual battles with cancer and to hopefully, one day, help win the war against this disease.

The passage of a major bill in Texas threatens the national safety net that has allowed tens of thousands of Americans to get around abortion bans.
House Bill 7 targets health care providers in states such as California, New York and Massachusetts that have, since the fall of Roe v. Wade, used telehealth to prescribe abortion pills. Interacting with patients virtually, those providers never leave their home states, which have laws explicitly protecting them from out-of-state prosecution. Those protections hold even if the patient is located in a state with a ban, like Texas. Only eight states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — have those protections in place for health providers.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

House Bill 7 gives anti-abortion activists a new tool that heightens the risk for medical professionals. It says any private citizen can bring a civil lawsuit, with a minimum payout of $100,000, against anyone who makes medication abortion available to a Texan. That includes prescribing, mailing and distributing pills. The bill’s authors have also said it would allow suits against drug manufacturers.
The Texas bill is yet to be signed by the state’s Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and would not take effect until the first week of December. But if it successfully lowers the number of abortions done in Texas, it’s likely to inspire similar legislation in other states with bans.
“We need to be thinking about this as a blueprint,” said Jessica Waters, a legal scholar at American University who specializes in reproductive rights. “Texas is taking this unprecedented action. It’s the first of its type to really target out-of-state abortion providers, and I think we will see more states do this.”
Some experts and shield law providers told The 19th that the bill could stop some abortion pills from being mailed to Texas. The legal risks to shield law providers mean that relatively few health professionals offer telehealth abortions to people in states like Texas — amplifying the possible consequences if any decide to stop.
“There probably will be some shield providers who stop sending pills into Texas because of the law because they’re taking great personal risk to do so,” said Elisa Wells, who runs the website Plan C, a clearinghouse of telehealth abortion options.

Already, the election of President Donald Trump has deterred some health providers from offering telehealth abortions to people living under bans, said Rebecca Nall, who runs the website INeedanA, a comprehensive database of abortion providers.
Some policy analysts argued that if HB 7 drives out just a few more health providers, it could seriously limit who in Texas can get abortions.
“Even if it’s just a small impact on the availability of care or availability of medication abortion in the state, it can have a really big impact,” said Kimya Forouzan, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
A week before the bill’s passage, one California-based telehealth provider told The 19th that the recent onslaught of lawsuits against providers has left her increasingly unsure of how long she will be able to continue offering abortions to people in other states. She declined to speak further after HB 7 passed.
“Every day it feels like it’s very tenuous,” said the doctor, who asked that her name be withheld because of the risk of incurring a lawsuit. “It feels like things are ramping up.”
Debra Lynch, a nurse who runs the shield law practice called Her Safe Harbor, said she is now in regular communication with other health professionals who worry HB 7 will make it too dangerous to continue offering telehealth abortions to Texans, despite the protections of their state laws.
“We’re hearing from other providers that have large on-the-ground practices: Is it worth it for them to continue to take this risk by providing a telehealth service, if it’s going to pose a risk to their on-ground practice?” she said. “They’re concerned. If they continue to do the telehealth abortion, is that going to, through civil action, pose a big threat to their ability to maintain their in-person clinics?”
Confusion over maternal care medication plagues politics in Louisiana and beyond

Still, several shield law providers said that they intend to continue offering telehealth abortions to Texans, even after the new legislation takes effect.
“We’re talking with lawyers and other stakeholders, but right now we don’t anticipate changing anything about our practice,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who runs the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project. “We believe our shield law protects us from these civil lawsuits.”
Health providers are only one component of the telehealth abortion ecosystem, and it’s not yet clear how others, such as drug distributors or pharmaceutical manufacturers, will react to the threat of new financial penalties. Both Danco and GenBioPro, the two main U.S. manufacturers of one of the key drugs used in medication abortions, declined to comment on how they intend to respond to HB 7.
That said, “the legislation is aimed at disincentivizing online pharmacies and manufacturers from sending medications into the state altogether,” said Nimra Chowdhry, senior state legislative counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.
John Seago, the head of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, said in a statement that he believes HB 7 can offer a blueprint for other states seeking to block telehealth abortions. The largest state to ban abortion, Texas has for more than a decade served as a testing ground for restrictive policies that, when effective, have been copied around the country. Texas was also the first state to outlaw most abortions, enacting a six-week ban in 2021 — months before the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe.
Despite sustained pressure from national abortion opponents, the White House has not taken action to block telehealth abortions. If this law is effective at doing so — a key goal for abortion opponents, who remain frustrated over the large swath of patients still able to access care — similar legislation is likely to emerge in conservative-led statehouses across the country.
“It certainly is a shot across the bow, to be very public and loud about taking on shield laws and ending mailed medication abortion in the state of Texas,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor of law at the University of Texas Austin. “I’m not sure it changes what’s happening yet — and that’s what I think we’re all waiting to see.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Abortion opponents across the country have been focused on finding a way to stop telehealth abortions. Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician, is a defendant in criminal and separate civil lawsuits put forth by the Louisiana and Texas attorneys general. Two Texas individuals — both represented by the anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, who helped craft HB 7 — have also filed wrongful death suits against out-of-state health care providers. One suit targets California-based Dr. Remy Coeytaux, and the other is against the telehealth organization Aid Access.
Lawmakers from states with shield laws have suggested that they will defend organizations and individuals making telehealth abortions available to Texans.
A spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta said that state’s chief law enforcement officer “stands ready to enforce California’s robust laws that protect patients, providers, and those assisting in abortion access.” This week, New York Attorney General Letitia James intervened in a Texas-based lawsuit that argues the Empire State’s shield law is unconstitutional.
Texas lawmakers are divided on whether their new bill passes constitutional muster, with several state Democrats arguing that its provisions could violate the U.S. and state constitutions. And abortion opponents disagree on how successful it will be in stopping telehealth abortions.
Seago said in a statement that the bill is “the most effective Pro-Life defense against out-of-state companies and activists that send abortion pills to Texas.” But another anti-abortion activist, Texans for Life head Kyleen Wright, called it “vastly oversold” in its ability to halt telehealth. She pointed out that Texas law already offers a mechanism to sue people who help residents get abortions — the six-week abortion ban that took effect in 2021 — but that nobody has used that law’s civil suit offering to try to block telehealth.
In Texas, women like Raquel are grappling with what the end of telehealth would mean. The mother of two living near Houston discovered last fall that she was pregnant, despite using contraception. She feared for her life — the last time she had given birth, her postpartum depression had been so powerful that she had required hospitalization.
“I never want to be back in that situation where I wanted to end my life because of how I felt — I couldn’t do that to my children, I couldn’t do it to my husband, I couldn’t do it to my family in general,” she said. “It was life or death.”
Raquel, who asked to be referred to by her middle name because few people know about her abortion, ordered medication from Aid Access. Beyond talking with someone at the organization, Raquel discussed her decision with her doctor and her therapist. Her husband, whose job often requires months of travel at once, took time off from work to stay home with her during the abortion.
But even without a telehealth option, she said, she would have found a way to end her pregnancy: driving 15 hours to Colorado, or finding a way to Mexico for care. She expressed anger about the state’s effort to eliminate that path — and fear about what it could mean for other people in situations like hers.
“It pisses me off because it’s really nobody’s business but your own,” she said. “And it’s sad because now these women — and potentially me — we have to go through twice as much to receive care if that’s what we so choose to do. And that’s just not right. It’s not fair, and we’re going backwards in time.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia is making progress in addressing staffing shortages in its crowded jails and prisons, but hundreds of positions remain unfilled. David Kelly, commissioner for the state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told lawmakers that it continues to be one of the major problems in the division.
“As of July, we have over 410 vacancies,” he said Tuesday to members of the Legislative Oversight Committee on Corrections and Public Safety. “I want to find a way to bring those vacancies down and we are working diligently.”
He added, “We’ve trained over 1,000 [new employees] since January 2024. That’s an amazing statistic.”
Kelly stepped into the role of commissioner in June after serving as a Republican lawmaker in the House of Delegates. While in the state Legislature, he chaired a committee on jails and prisons and championed raises for correctional officers during a staffing crisis that prompted a state of emergency from 2022 through last year.
But the 2023 raises and hiring bonuses under former Gov. Jim. Justice — which cost $21 million — only included uniformed officers, leaving out non-uniformed staff in jails like cooks, counselors and more.
“They did not get a raise like the uniformed staff did. They are a vital and intricate part of the daily operations of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation,” Kelly said. 
The state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation has a more than $354 million budget for 16 correctional facilities, correctional officer salaries and more. The state’s juvenile correctional services under DCR has a separate budget of roughly $57 million. 
Kelly said that multiple counties are unable to pay their jail bills, pushing the cost onto the state. West Virginia counties pay the state per inmate per day to house inmates at regional jails.
“There are counties that simply cannot pay … and that’s because of the counties’ financial situations,” he said. “When they cannot pay, it costs the state more.”
There are good things happening in the corrections system, Kelly said, noting a program that pairs incarcerated persons with shelter animals for training and care. Through a Paws from Prison Program, the dogs are later given to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or children with disabilities for therapy purposes. 
“The program has proven to be transformative. It boosts morale of our inmate population who is doing this,” Kelly said. “It teaches responsibility and builds empathy. That prepares inmates with successful reintegration into society.”
Kelly is focused on rehabilitation when possible and keeping the state’s recidivism rate low. But, he explained that there are challenges reintegrating people back into the community, especially when it comes to finding employment and housing. 
Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha
He noted that it costs the state $90.16 per day for each incarcerated person. Medical expenses are contributing to that cost. 
“We currently have 11 inmates who have been granted parole and have exhausted all means for housing,” Kelly said. “Most of those are sex offenders or others who have medical issues … We’re still trying to find an adequate house for people who need to be able to move on.” 
Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, also said that housing was a challenge for inmates who had completed their time with DCR. “I know when I was on the parole board, housing was a huge issue for those inmates who were ready and parole qualified,” he said.
Decision to serve inmates less meals on weekends reversed
Kelly also told lawmakers that DCR has reversed its recent decision to serve incarcerated persons two meals per day on weekends instead of three.  
Lewis questioned the thought behind the change, prompting Kelly to explain that the division was testing serving two meals with the same caloric count and nutritional count that would be found in three meals to see if it was feasible. A lot of food was thrown out on the weekends, he said. 
Kelly said it was a test “that did not work.” 
“When we roll out a program and it doesn’t meet our standard of excellence, we’re not going to keep it,” he said. “We rolled it back immediately, and we got things back to three meals a day.”
Ahead of the meeting, family members of incarcerated West Virginians and clergy members delivered letters to Kelly asking him to fix problems with the food served in state jails and prisons. 
“Although this decision was walked back, there’s no guarantee DCR won’t try to serve fewer meals again. West Virginia jails and prisons are also notorious for serving small portions of food that are overprocessed, lacking in fresh nutrients and sometimes rotten or spoiled,” a press release said. “As the families of incarcerated West Virginians, we believe our loved ones deserve to be treated with respect.”

During the war, Denorris Howell was strangled to death. No one was charged with his killing.
Howell was one of 42 people who died by homicide in Mississippi prisons over the past decade, a toll uncovered by a reporting team that includes Mississippi Today, The Marshall Project – Jackson, the Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. Total convictions in those cases? Six.
“Oh, my God, there’s something wrong with that picture,” said Howell’s great aunt, Annie Moffitt, who runs Annie’s Home Cooking in Holly Springs, where he once worked.
Parchman’s gang war came after years of neglect by state officials, who slashed millions in funding and allowed conditions at the prison to deteriorate after federal courts ended oversight of the facility in 2011, according to an investigation by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting, now a part of Mississippi Today, and ProPublica.

The U.S. Department of Justice later blamed the war and the violence leading up to it on inadequate staffing, cursory investigations, insufficient security measures, unfettered access to contraband and uncontrolled gang activity. 
“These systemic failures result in an environment rife with weapons, drugs, gang activity, extortion, and violence,” the report said.
Mississippi Department of Corrections officials said they referred only one of the three homicides in three days to prosecutors. Overall, the agency referred 15 of the 42 homicides to prosecutors over the past decade, and said in a recent statement that it “remains committed to ensuring the safety of inmates in its custody.”
David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project, called these numbers inconceivably low. “I can’t imagine any other law enforcement agency failing to refer three-fourths of the homicides under its jurisdiction to prosecutors,” he said. “These victims’ lives are not seen as sufficiently valuable to warrant the effort.”
After the gang war, Gov. Tate Reeves hired the former head of Angola, Louisiana’s most notorious prison, to clean up Parchman and the other prisons. The Mississippi Legislature passed raises for correctional officers.
But the violence that initially declined under Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain’s leadership is now back on the rise. With five killings already, 2025 marks Mississippi’s worst year for prison homicides since 2021.
Fatal response to a dispute over money
Denorris “Nod” Howell grew up in the Waterford community between Oxford and Holly Springs, the eldest of three children.
“He was a good young man who treated all of us with the ultimate respect,” recalled Moffitt, his great aunt. “He loved his grandmother, who was my sister.”
After the teen shot up to 6-foot-1, he played power forward for Holly Springs High School and graduated in 2001.
“Denorris was a good kid,” said his mother, Janice Wilkins. “He was an obedient child. I didn’t have much problems out of him growing up, other than him being a typical teenager.”

Unlike others, he and his brother didn’t hang out in clubs, she said. “When kids grow up, they venture out and do their own thing, but as long as you are in my house, you have rules.”
After graduating, Howell moved out and got married. He and his wife had four children. He worked a series of odd jobs, first at a warehouse in Oxford and then at his great aunt’s restaurant.
In 2010, Howell and a friend were at his home when LaKeith Jones arrived. According to testimony, Howell had recently sold a car to Jones, who still owed him money. Once Jones paid the remaining balance, Howell would give him the keys.
The conversation between them grew heated. Howell shot Jones five times.
Howell called 911 and told the dispatcher that he had shot Jones in self-defense because he thought Jones was about to pull out a pistol. He later told a deputy that he had not wanted to shoot Jones, but that Jones was robbing him and had robbed him four times in the past.
Sheriff’s investigators did not find a pistol on Jones’ body, and none of the witnesses who testified at Howell’s trial said that Jones had a weapon.
In 2012, a jury convicted Howell of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 17 years and began serving that time at Parchman, one of the nation’s most infamous prisons.
The maximum security prison holds up to 2,542 men in seven buildings, surrounded by an 18,000-acre working farm. The prison’s long history of violence and abuse has been documented by journalists, researchers, filmmakers and blues singers.
‘I was praying that he was safe’

After her son began serving his time in Parchman, two hours away, Wilkins began working locally at the Marshall County Correctional Facility, where she taught incarcerated men how to give haircuts.
The whole time there, she thought of her son, she said. “I was praying that he was safe.”
Through her classes, men learned all styles of cuts, and she said prison officials grew to appreciate her. “They call me ‘Boss Lady,’ the one that everybody loves,” she said.
After a year of instruction, the men “know what they’re doing,” she said. “They get a license just like mine,” she said, flashing her own license from the state Board of Cosmetology and Barbering.
Many of those she taught have left prison far behind. “They’re in barber shops, and some of them have ventured out and gotten their own shop,” she said. “They’re just doing really good.”
While she worked, she waited for her son’s release. He had told her that he might come home as early as 2020, because he could be paroled after serving half his sentence. 
She began to plan for a huge family gathering to welcome him home, complete with chicken, fish, frog legs, shrimp, crab legs and vegetables — all the food he loved.
‘Ain’t nothing under control’
In the waning days of 2019, a war between the Vice Lords and the Gangster Disciples spread across Mississippi prisons.
In hopes of preventing the violence from spreading, Parchman officials locked down the men in their cells to prevent their movement.
Despite this, Walter Gates, 25, who was serving a 10-year sentence for burglary from Coahoma County, was stabbed to death on New Year’s Day at Parchman. Roosevelt Holliman, 32, who was serving 12 years for armed robbery and burglary out of Forrest County, met the same fate a day later. Two suspects in the Holliman killing are pending trial.
Reeves declared in a Jan. 3, 2020, tweet, “Grateful to those working to restore order and safety. That is the first priority. Then we need answers and justice on the people who perpetrated this violence.”
The Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting received a series of text messages and videos during that war from people in the prisons and their loved ones.
A message sent on Jan. 2 identified a female correctional officer in Unit 29 “giving inmates keys right now, and my brothers have no one to alert.”
A similar message followed on a private Facebook page, accusing the same officer of cutting off lights.
A screengrab from a video filmed by a prisoner on a contraband phone in January 2020 shows a cell in darkness, while the rest of the unit is lit. 
Photos and videos showed men in red-and-white-striped uniforms, reserved for people convicted of the most violent crimes, walking freely through Unit 29, with no correctional officers in sight.
The message from inside Parchman continued: “If MDOC thinks they have control, they are very mistaken.”
In a video recorded during the unrest on a contraband mobile phone, a cell sits in darkness while other parts of the prison are lit.
Loud shouting can be heard as an incarcerated person inside the cell appears to be punching someone. A prisoner recording the video narrates, “They’re straight up hitting the motherf—ers with knives and sh–, beating them motherf—ers up.”
A man can be heard saying, “I’ve got him in a chokehold.”
Another voice cheers him on: “Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Dead. Oh, yeah. Dead. Deaaaaad.”
Despite the loud shouting throughout the incident captured on video, no officer can be seen responding.
At 3 a.m. on Jan. 3, an officer called additional staff to the Unit 29 building, where they found Howell’s body in his cell. His cellmate, who had been stabbed repeatedly and whose name was blacked out on the incident report, was taken by ambulance to the hospital. At 4:22 a.m., the coroner pronounced Howell dead.
The coroner ruled that Howell’s cellmate had strangled him to death in self-defense.
By the time the governor decided to shut down Unit 29 on Jan. 28, five prisoners at Parchman had been killed, and dozens had been injured. Three others were found hanging in their cells. MDOC ruled their deaths suicides.
Detrick Munford, who was a captain over Unit 29 then and later served as Parchman’s deputy warden, said he heard on the evening of Jan. 2 about a female officer allegedly sharing her keys with prisoners. He said he confronted her and took her keys.
After that, he opened an investigation into the officer’s actions to determine if she had a relationship with a gang, he said. “When she found out, she quit.”
He sent his findings to the prison’s investigators, he said. “They take it from there.”
No charges were ever brought against the officer, who was never identified in any department report. She said in text messages recently that prisoners lied about her, that she was never investigated by MDOC and that she wasn’t even at work that night. MDOC has not responded to requests for her timesheets.
No one ever got her keys, she wrote. “I was the one lied on.”
She said after Howell’s death, Munford checked that she had her keys.
Munford said he knows of some cases where correctional officers did favors for gangs. He said he also knows of several cases where correctional officers enabled violence against those behind bars, but he doesn’t know of any cases where officers were prosecuted.
Munford said officers can cut off the lights to an individual cell.
Parchman is located in a rural area where there are few jobs, he said. “People tend to think they can’t do no better, so you have to go along with the system.”
If people refuse to “go along with the system, they’ll find a way to get you out of the way,” he said. “There’s so much corruption.”
Within weeks after Howell’s death, two more men were killed at Parchman. Prison officials tried to reassure the public that these were isolated incidents. 
“We have been working around the clock with MDOC and DPS [the Department of Public Safety] to respond immediately and prevent this going forward,” Reeves tweeted on Jan. 21, 2020.
In the wake of the killings, Reeves appointed Cain as corrections commissioner to clean up the prisons and restore safety.
By the end of that year, six people had been killed at Parchman and three more in other parts of the state’s prison system. No one has been convicted in connection with any of the deaths.
‘He told me that he feared for his life’
On Jan. 3, 2020, Wilkins got a call from the chaplain that her son was dead. Since then, she said, she has received no other details about his death and no autopsy report.

“I just felt empty,” she said. 
She paused. “Sometimes it feels like it just happened yesterday.”
She had just talked to her son the night before, and he sounded nervous, she said. “He told me that he feared for his life.”
She said her son told her that the lights had been turned out and that a guard was letting men out of their cells.
Years later, she heard a rumor from the men she worked with at the Marshall County Correctional Facility that her son’s cellmate had been killed in prison, but it offered her little solace. “I don’t wish that on nobody,” she said. She later found out that the rumor was false. 
Today, five years after his death, Wilkins continues to have questions. No one from the prison has ever explained what happened to her son, she said. 
“Justice needs to be served,” she said. “My son had four children who loved him very dearly.”

Two neighboring townships in a heavily fracked part of Pennsylvania are seeking federal and state funding for a public water system to replace private wells that have been contaminated for more than three years.
Freeport and Springhill townships in Greene County the southwest corner of the state have each recently used the contamination to declare a “disaster emergency” because of their long-running water problems. The declarations allow a municipality to apply for public funds to fix a problem.
The Greene County communities are believed to be the first in the state to use the emergency declaration in relation to drinking-water contamination, said Guy Hostutler, chairman of the Freeport Board of Supervisors, which published its statement in June. Neighboring Springhill issued its own disaster declaration in August.
Since fracking for natural gas began in Pennsylvania in the mid-2000s, some residents have complained that their water, if drawn from aquifers, has been contaminated with hazardous chemicals used in fracking. In those cases, residents are forced to rely on bottled or filtered water, or on “buffaloes”—large plastic tanks installed outside homes and periodically filled with clean water.
Critics of the gas industry blame the contamination on “frac-outs,” in which fracking fluid pumped underground at high pressure leaks from its borehole into aquifers or escapes from the surface. Such incidents have polluted some drinking water sources and delayed the construction of gas wells or pipelines.
In Freeport’s case, around 200 of its approximately 300 residents have experienced discolored and chemically contaminated water since June 2022, Hostutler said. That month, the gas company EQT experienced a “frac-out” as it was horizontally drilling a nearby well.
Since then, affected homeowners have been unable to use their wells and have relied instead on water from buffaloes or filtration. EQT has provided both while not acknowledging that it had anything to do with water conditions there, Public Source reported last year.
The well water has been tested by Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection, which determined in February that the water is not fit for human consumption. Freeport then approved the disaster declaration that allows it to seek public funding for a public water system.
“We filed it because we felt it was our best option to try to get funding to try to get a water line laid to the residents of the Freeport-Springhill area,” Hostutler said in an interview. “We’re a very small township and the rough estimate for the water line is between $21 and $25 million. We don’t have anything close to that, so we are going to need state funding as well as federal funding to get the water line laid.”
Hostutler backed away from the declaration’s claim that EQT was responsible for the contamination. The document said that “on or about June 19, 2022, a contamination event caused by actions of EQT has caused or threatens to cause injury, damage, and suffering to persons and property of Freeport Township.”
But in the interview, Hostutler said the contamination could have been caused by other parties, such as pipeline builders or operators of conventional gas wells. Township solicitor Grant Allison said the municipality is acknowledging the possibility but is not excluding EQT.
“There are other companies performing work in the area, and it would not be prudent for the Township to disqualify all other actors while there are still active investigations ongoing,” Allison wrote in an email. “The Township is not absolving EQT by any means.”
Allison said the disaster declaration is not connected to a pending class-action lawsuit by affected Freeport residents, accusing EQT of contaminating water and exposing residents to potentially harmful chemicals. The suit, filed in June 2024, states that Pennsylvania officials have reported some 400 cases of gas-industry impacts on underground water supplies since 2007.
Asked why it took three years for the town to issue its disaster declaration, Hostutler said it had to wait for the DEP to conclude that some private wells contained water unfit for human consumption. He declined to identify the contaminants found in the private well water, saying that information is part of the residents’ lawsuit.
Even if money is found for a public water system, it could be three or four years before it’s in place, Hostutler said.
EQT did not respond to two emails seeking comment. The Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade group for the gas industry, also did not respond.
The DEP investigated 24 cases in which Freeport residents claimed the industry contaminated their wells, but it found no evidence of such a link, said Neil Shader, a spokesman for the agency. Still, the DEP is now looking into more recent complaints, including one that the township’s water source for washing vehicles and other non-drinking purposes has been contaminated by unconventional gas drilling.
The Center for Coalfield Justice, an advocacy group for workers in the coal and gas industries and nearby residents in southwest Pennsylvania, has provided drinking water for some affected residents. It has also pressed EQT to pay for restoring water supplies that CCJ contends the company contaminated. But after the disaster declarations, the group fears EQT is hoping to avoid the cost.
“EQT is interested in letting taxpayers pay the cost of cleaning up their mess,” said CCJ’s executive director, Sarah Martik. “Since federal and state representatives have got involved, the conversation has gone from holding EQT accountable to providing public water. Now it’s, ‘Let’s get taxpayer dollars to pay for that.’”
Residents fear additional contamination, Martik added.
“Clearly there is a pathway for the fracking fluids to be engaging in the aquifer,” she said. “People were saying, ‘As soon as I bathed in this water, I got rashes’; ‘my tomato plants died after I watered with this’; ‘my dogs won’t go anywhere near this water.’ People just don’t necessarily have clean water.”
Now that the townships have issued their disaster declarations, some state lawmakers are pledging to help find public funding to fix the water problems. They include Rep. Bud Cook, a Republican who urged Freeport officials to approach PennVest, a financing authority that offers low-cost loans for municipal infrastructure projects that address water and other public needs.
“I am saddened to hear about the ongoing water-quality issues in Freeport Township, and the recent declaration of a Disaster Emergency,” Cook wrote to the town’s supervisors in July. “Please know that my office is here as a resource throughout the process.”
The office of U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican who represents the area, did not respond to questions about whether he supports finding federal dollars to help pay for public water in the townships.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/natural-gas-well-site-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

The event celebrates ""everyone’s favorite trash cat through art, crafts, games, food and fun."" (PossumFest Facebook page)Kenny Cody, a conservative writer and Republican activist from northeastern Tennessee, recently wrote an opinion column in Human Events which took aim at Kentucky’s own Tyler Childers, labeling him “nothing but a hick lib.” 
His argument boiled down to the idea that “Childers fell victim to Nashville, progressivism, the mainstream media, and the ‘hick lib’ mindset.” In other words, Childers had traded his authenticity for progressive politics and that his music and message no longer belong to Appalachia because they don’t match Cody’s idea of what Appalachia should be.  
As advertised by Kentucky for Kentucky.
I decided to take Cody’s framing for a test drive. 
My wife and I attended PossumFest last weekend in Cumberland, which is in Harlan County tucked right in between Harlan and Whitesburg, and I wore my “Hick Lib” t-shirt recently purchased from Kentucky for Kentucky. It felt like the perfect place to see how the phrase, weaponized in Cody’s column, would land among the very people he believes “hick liberalism” alienates.
Outfitted with my “Totally Opossum” cap and mirrored driver’s glasses, I walked through the festival crowd with my social scientist’s curiosity. Would folks scowl? Would I be politely ignored? Would somebody say something snide or argumentative? Or would the phrase just fly right over people’s heads?
My wife and I weren’t exactly blending in either. As I pushed her around town and the festival in her bright pink wheelchair, we were hard to miss. There wasn’t actually a parade at PossumFest, but if there had been, we probably could’ve rolled right in and passed for a float. Between the shirt, the cap and the hot pink wheels, we were about as subtle as a brass band.
And people noticed … but in the best way. The woman running Poor Folks Arts & Crafts flashed me a big thumbs-up. A merchant sitting outside her shop hollered across the street, “Love your shirt!!” Dozens of others smiled and said the same. More than a few asked, “Where can I get one like that?” No one seemed confused. No one seemed offended. Not a soul tried to run us out of town.
Culture over politics: What PossumFest made me remember
Part of why this struck me so strongly is that I’m not originally from Kentucky, although I’ve lived in Kentucky for the past 33 years. I grew up in rural Missouri, in a place once known for its “prairie progressives” — farmers and small-town folks who backed unions representing many of our fathers in the Kansas City automobile plants, supported our public schools by attending every home game, believed in the old FFA motto that began with the words, “I believe in the future of farming” and almost always voted Democrat.

That ground has since shifted, and today it votes solidly Republican. In that way, it mirrors Eastern Kentucky, which has taken its own long road from labor-Democrat loyalties to being ruby red on the political map.
But what I was once again reminded at PossumFest is that cultural identity in rural America is always more complex than what political pundits would have us believe. Communities don’t shed their history of resilience, compassion or creativity just because voting patterns change. Tyler Childers knows that, and his music reflects it. Appalachia, with its struggles and beauty, its stubborn independence and deep compassion, tells a story of a people who endure, adapt and care.
So if Cody wants to use “hick lib” as a slur, that’s his business. But from what I saw at PossumFest, Kentucky is more than ready to reclaim the label with a grin and a wink. Maybe, that’s the real story Cody missed: Appalachia isn’t afraid of change, or of artists like Kentucky’s very own Tyler Childers who dare to sing it into the open.
Don’t write off rural Kentucky
And for Democrats who have written off places like Harlan County, here’s a bit of advice: Don’t. Folks out there still care about the same things they always have like steady jobs, good schools, clean water, safe roads and fair wages. They haven’t lost their sense of community, or their pride. What they’ve lost, more often than not, is the feeling that anyone from outside the region still sees them.
If you want rural Kentuckians back, which you so often now claim you do, don’t do it with a consultant’s memo or a TV ad. Do it by showing up. Sit a spell and listen. Hey, why not even wander through a fall festival and strike up a conversation or two? You might be surprised how quickly doors open when people know you’re not just passing through or only looking for a vote.
Because out there, a “hick lib” is simply someone who belongs, someone who carries forward the mountain spirit, the stubborn pride, and the heart of Kentucky.  In other words, they’re Kentuckians just like the rest of us.

Last school year, more than 430 students from 13 school districts and charter networks earned something new and powerful alongside their diplomas: the Seal of Climate Literacy. This credential — created in Colorado through Senate Bill 24-14 and signed into law last year by Gov. Jared Polis — marks more than academic accomplishment. It signifies that these young people have taken bold, hands-on steps to understand and address the climate challenges facing their home communities.
In Hayden, one student studied drought-resistant crops to preserve his family’s ranching legacy. In Denver, another created a podcast exploring the mental health impacts of climate change. In Boulder, a graduate who lost her home in the Marshall Fire focused her senior project on building climate resilience in the wake of disaster.

In the coming school year, more Colorado districts and charter networks should adopt the Seal of Climate Literacy. This would expand opportunities for students to lead on climate in ways that are practical, empowering, and responsive to their communities. 
As CEO of a Colorado-based nonprofit focused on climate literacy and education pathways, I’ve watched countless programs come and go. But what’s emerging here is more than a promising initiative. It’s a movement that reflects what education can and should be: relevant, student-driven and connected to the real world.
The Seal of Climate Literacy gives students the opportunity to explore local climate issues — from water conservation and wildfire risk to air quality and biodiversity — and take informed, community-based action. They’re planting trees, testing soil, restoring ecosystems, educating peers and partnering with community leaders. They’re not just learning about climate change. They’re responding to it.
That kind of agency matters — especially now. A recent report from the American Psychological Association found that 85% of young people aged 16 to 25 are moderately or extremely worried about climate change. That worry can weigh heavily. But when students have the tools to turn concern into contribution, they gain more than knowledge. They gain direction, confidence and hope.
It’s no surprise, then, that the Seal is spreading quickly. In the 2023-24 school year, 16 students earned it. This spring, over 430 did — and across a broad swath of the state. Notably, that growth isn’t confined to one region or political leaning. From rural mountain towns to urban corridors, students are protecting their communities, honoring their heritage, and preparing for the future.
This common ground is what gives the Seal its quiet power. While climate change often surfaces as a polarizing topic in national discourse, young people in Colorado are proving that it doesn’t have to be. Their work reflects personal stakes, not political ones. They are forging a path forward that is practical, hopeful, and grounded in mutual responsibility.
The Seal is also preparing students for Colorado’s green economy. As sectors like renewable energy, water management, sustainable construction, and regenerative agriculture expand, so too does the need for a workforce that understands the complex relationship between climate and community. Students completing Seal projects are gaining experience, building networks, and exploring careers in real time.
Even better, the program is accessible. Schools don’t need to invest in costly new curricula or infrastructure. The Seal is designed to be low-cost, adaptable, and easy to integrate into existing coursework and partnerships. What’s required is simply the willingness to trust students, support their curiosity, and celebrate their contributions. 
These contributions are already shaping communities. One student helped reconnect her Navajo community with traditional ecological practices. Another worked with local government to increase wildfire preparedness in her neighborhood. These aren’t abstract ideas. They’re lived responses to lived realities.
As a new school year dawns, the momentum behind the Seal of Climate Literacy is undeniable — and too important to leave behind. More Colorado districts and charter networks should adopt the Seal and give students the opportunity to lead on climate in ways that are meaningful, practical, and tied to their communities.
At a time with many cuts to public education, this initiative is a way to offer students and educators something important to them. This doesn’t require major new spending or policy shifts, only a commitment to trust students, elevate local knowledge, and support the future they’re already working to build.
To educators, school leaders, and policymakers: Learn more. Reach out. Join the growing number of communities making the Seal part of their vision for student success.
That Boulder graduate who turned loss into leadership? She’s not the exception — she’s the example. Colorado has shown what’s possible. Let’s keep building on it.

The mixed-income development downtown is a partnership between the Durham Housing Authority and developer Laurel Street Residential. It will replace 214 public housing units with 538 mixed-income homes, including 348 affordable units and 190 market-rate units. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the housing authority and City of Durham a $40 million Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grant to support the redevelopment.

“The important thing is that we are keeping a promise made to the community,” Anthony Snell, Interim CEO of the Durham Housing Authority said in an interview with NC Newsline. “The community made a major investment in us [housing authority] to be the leader in the delivery of housing.”
Snell acknowledged that some residents didn’t believe the housing authority would follow through on plans for the redevelopment. Some residents forced to move complained that there wasn’t enough affordable, safe housing available to replace the public housing that was demolished.
“I hope it is establishing a level of credibility, showing that we are indeed committed to what we say, and I hope it removes some level of uncertainty and anxiety about what it is we do,” Snell said. “But let’s face it, housing is such an essential element of one’s life, anytime you broach that subject, there’s always going to be a level of anxiety around.”
Snell noted that it has taken about seven years to get to the ribbon cutting for Vanguard Apartments and the groundbreaking for Dillard Street Apartments.
The groundbreaking and ribbon cutting took place on a sunny but breezy morning with 150 or more people in attendance, including such Durham dignitaries such as former mayors Bill Bell and Steve Schewel and former state senator Floyd McKissick. DJ Brian Dawson kept the crowd moving and on cue, played “Boots on the Ground,” which spawned the popular line dance by the same name, which Snell frequently referenced.
Vanguard is the first phase of the four-phase redevelopment of two public housing communities, 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments. Housing authority officials said 21 units are set aside for former residents of the former public housing communities.

Meanwhile, construction has begun on Phase 2, which is Commerce Street Apartments. Construction of the 172-unit project, with 88-units set aside for seniors and 84-units for families is expected to be completed in September 2026. Dillard Street Apartments is a 146-unit project with a June 2026 completion date. Sixty-four of units at Dillard Street Apartments are set aside for former Liberty Street Apartments residents. The fourth phase is Main Street, a 148-unit apartment complex for individuals and families. Construction on that projects is expected to begin next year.
Bianca Rivera, a Vanguard Apartments resident who lived in public housing with her son, said the new apartment was worth the wait.
“I’m happy and I feel safe,” Rivera said, explaining that she and her son were the victims of an attempted home invasion at their previous address.










“What started as a desire to redevelop two former public housing communities is now a choice neighborhood.


– Dionne Nelson


The redevelopment of 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments into a mixed income community comes as North Carolina and other parts of the nation face a severe housing shortage. A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that North Carolina has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
State Sen. Natalie Murdock, D-Durham, said Durham’s redevelopment reminds us why the federal government must continue to fund public housing.
“I’m really concerned about the federal government not wanting to provide money to housing authorities across the state and the nation,” Murdock said. “Everyone deserves a clean, safe place to live, so I’m thrilled that we are breaking ground today to deliver on that promise to residents that we would improve our housing conditions.”
Murdock said she believes there’s more state government can do to facilitate affordable housing across the state.

“We need more tax incentives to build affordable housing  but it has to be that plus more federal investments and it all has to all come together,” Murdock said.
Dionne Nelson, president and CEO of Laurel Street Residential, said Tuesday marked the company’s third ground breaking on the site.
“What started as a desire to redevelop two former public housing communities is now a choice neighborhood and City of Durham partnership that allowed us to accelerate the revitalization of this entire community,” Nelson said.
Durham Mayor Leo Williams said there are currently about 3,000 housing units in the pipeline for Durham.
“This is important work and we’re not just providing much needed affordable housing, we’re building communities and opportunities that all Durham residents can call home,” Williams said.
Williams noted that in 2019, Durham voters passed a $95 million affordable housing bond, which was at the time the largest in the state’s history. A portion of that bond was used for the first phase of the 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments redevelopment, he said.
Adam Abram, board chairman of the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, said the redevelopment project is an economic engine that will help Durham prosper.

“It creates wealth,” Abram said. “Think of all of the construction that’s going on around here. Think of the jobs. Think of the security of the people who are going to live here in these homes and their children.”
Anthony Scott, the former CEO of the Durham Housing Authority who resigned in December, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony. Scott had just arrived in Durham when plans for the redevelopment were unveiled.
“We talked about how we could do better at incorporating public housing residents into the larger fabric of Durham, and how we could create a better overall community, better social-economic environment,” Scott said. “To see yet another step for that coming through, is really exciting.”
He said public housing residents doubted whether the housing authority could live up to the promises it made regarding the redevelopment.
“This was the most challenging because so many people had to be relocated,” Scott said of The Vanguard Apartments. “There were so many concerns about what we would or would not be able to accomplish.”
Scott is soon heading to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he will work to bring affordable housing to that community.
“When you look at the affordable housing crisis the country is facing, the only way it’s going to change is people are going to have to decide that this important enough that we pressure Congress to allocate funding for it, we get HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] to do some things to make it easier for housing authorities.”
Combat high housing costs, which spiked during COVID pandemic, will require partnerships such as the ones that enabled the 519 East Main and Liberty Street Apartments redevelopment, he said.
“We must have our city, state and federal partners come in  and help us make these kinds of communities a reality,” Scott said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ended broad emergency authorizations for COVID vaccines in recent weeks, which had allowed people to be able to walk into pharmacies without prescriptions to get their shots. Now, people need a prescription from their doctors or must be 65 and older. It is posing challenges for a range of Virginians, insured and uninsured. 
The prescription barrier has already proven to be a delay for a Northern Virginia woman who travels for work and is a cancer survivor. 
Laura Packard, a small business owner and health care activist based in Alexandria, called the shifts “such a mess.” 
When getting her annual flu shot last week she asked about a COVID booster shot, but was told she needed a prescription to get it. As she is traveling for work currently, she’s already contacted her doctor and her insurance company to determine when she can get the vaccine. 
“It shouldn’t be this hard,” she said in an email. “I’m a cancer survivor and medically vulnerable.”
Meanwhile, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet later this month to discuss guidance for doctors, insurance companies and states on how shots can be accessed. While ACIP plans to deliberate the future landscape of vaccines, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed critics of coronavirus vaccines to the committee, which could signal that the shots may be less accessible, more broadly. 
University of Virginia nursing professor Ashley Apple is noting the variety of barriers people can experience, or are already experiencing. 
One limitation for people may be costs. Insurance companies typically cover vaccines that are recommended by the CDC — a notion that is uncertain, pending the upcoming ACIP meeting. For those with insurance, their shots might be covered or partially-covered. Out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus vaccines can range in hundreds of dollars. CVS, for instance, charges $224.99. 
“While one barrier might not seem like a big deal for one population, it is for others,” Apple said.
Another is the ability to access a primary care provider and obtain a prescription in the first place. 
Around Virginia, about 3.8 million people lack a primary care provider nearby, according to a recent Virginia Commonwealth University study. 
Last week, two primary care facilities and an urgent care facility operating under Augusta Health announced their closures in Shenandoah Valley. While some of those patients need to travel only about 10 minutes away to other clinics, others will have to go farther, and face an additional barrier to their health care.
Overall, Apple said she anticipates “bottlenecks” in primary care because people will call in asking for prescriptions while others who didn’t have a provider previously will be making appointments as well, in order to establish their provider and get a prescription. 
For a quick fix, she posited that Virginia’s Department of Health could issue a standing order that could resolve the prescription requirement for Virginians in the interim. 
When The Mercury reached out to VDH on Tuesday inquiring about the idea, VDH epidemiology spokesman Logan Anderson said that he couldn’t answer the question yet. 
Governors in Minnesota and New York have recently issued orders directing standing orders for the COVID-19 vaccine. This offers flexibility for health care providers and pharmacists to provide the vaccine. 
The Mercury also asked if Gov. Glenn Youngkin was considering issuing an order but did not hear back from his spokesperson by the time of this publication. 
VDH’s local health districts in the state played a role when it came to vaccine rollout four years ago, a year into the pandemic, as the nation began to crack down on the global health emergency. 
Though the World Health Organization formally ended the pandemic classification in 2023, it has remained a key focus of prevention efforts through vaccinations. Last week, nearly 4,000 Virginians tested positive for COVID-19. As colder months approach and people are more likely to gather inside, airborne spread illnesses typically experience upticks.

She made the announcement in a video release.

With the exit of Josh Weil from the race earlier this summer, the 38-year-old Jenkins is now the biggest name in Florida Democratic politics to enter the race. She acknowledges that with Florida’s lean to the political right in recent years, she would be an underdog against Moody, but says her upset victory in a race for school board in 2020 in Brevard is proof that she has the stuff to win statewide.
“I live in a deep red county and I ran as an outed Democrat against a really well-known Republican incumbent,” Jenkins said in a phone interview last week, referring to Tina Descovich, who went on to co-found Moms for Liberty, the conservative parental rights organization.
“It was a nonpartisan race, but that’s not how the race was won by any means,” Jenkins added.
“One of the only strategies that my opponent had was to make sure that everyone knew that I was a registered Democrat and I still managed in a year that Donald Trump won [in the county] by 17 points to defeat her by nearly 10 points. And I did that just by being true to who I am. By being an honest educator, being passionate about what I was advocating for. Being a mom. And I just reject the idea that isn’t possible across the state. Because if I can do it in deep red Brevard County, it can be done in other areas.”
Democratic disadvantage
Florida Democratic Senate candidates have not been competitive against GOP incumbent in recent years. Marco Rubio defeated Val Demings by more than 16 points in 2022, and Rick Scott defeated Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 13 points in 2024.
Jenkins is aware that Democrats now have a 10-point registration gap with Republicans in the state but believes the fact that she hails from a conservative part of the state can boost her candidacy.
“I think it’s time that we had a Democratic statewide candidate who may not come from the traditional blue areas that we typically see, who understands what’s it like to talk directly to community members who may not be the same party registration and listen to their concerns and speak to those concerns and start to rebuild that trust and honest communication with them,” she said.
“Understand that there’s going to be somebody who’s really fighting for them and for their community and for their kids. And so we need to expand that coalition. We can’t just focus on our base, but we need to energize our base. We need to win back those independents, and we have to reach Republicans who are sick and tired of chaos and distractions.”
Susan MacManus via Twitter
Dr. Susan MacManus, professor emerita at the University of South Florida, agrees Jenkins definitely will be an underdog against Moody. “She’s got a steep hill to climb,” she said. “Her advantages are that she’s a new face and people are looking for new people in politics.”
MacManus added that Jenkins’ experience on the school board and her priorities on education “is definitely an attention-grabbing credential, without question.”
In addition to her single term on the school board from 2020-2024, Jenkins has led a political committee supporting school board members in battleground states called Educated We Stand.
Jenkins has considered running for U.S. Senate for a few years now. She flirted in 2023 with entering the 2024 race against Republican Rick Scott, but opted not to.
School board battles
A native of Staten Island, New York, Jenkins moved with her family to Brevard after her father retired from a career in law enforcement. She graduated from the University of Central Florida and worked for years as a speech pathologist in the Brevard County School District until she opted to run for the school board in 2020.
Jenkins’ tenure on the board took place as school boards across the country were riven with intense battles over face mask mandates, book bans, and treatment of LGBTQ students, especially transgender children.
“Protests in front of my home. The vandalism on my property. Three foot ‘F-U’ letters burned into my lawn. Be followed by private investigators. Slanderous websites,” she recounted in a speech in Tampa in 2023.
She opted against seeking a second term.
“I don’t know what you can throw at me that would shock me or make me waver, quite frankly,” she now says about that time. “I pushed through the loud noise and the hate and the intimidation because it was the right thing to do. And sometimes that’s hard. And it came at a great personal cost to me and my family, but I had to do it anyway. I knew it was the right thing to do.”
Whoever wins the Democratic primary will face Moody, 50, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to replace Marco Rubio in January. Rubio left the seat he had held since 2010 after Donald Trump picked him for U.S. Secretary of State. While she was elected twice statewide to serve as the state’s attorney general, Jenkins believes Moody remains an unknown quantity to many Floridians.
A ‘dangerous Ashley Moody’
U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody via Senate website
“Honestly, I don’t think most people really know who she is,” Jenkins said. “And that’s dangerous. I think part of this campaign is trying to raise awareness of how dangerous Ashley Moody can be, because she’s just a rubber stamp for Ron DeSantis and for Donald Trump. She’s a career politician just like Rick Scott. They take their marching orders from insurance industries and special interests and the extremist party leaders, and I think it’s really important for voters to be aware of that.”
In a press release announcing her candidacy, Jenkins said Moody had voted to rip health care away from more than 1 million Floridians when she supported the Trump domestic spending bill, which includes cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. She also criticized her for her recent comments supporting DeSantis’ proposal to end vaccine mandates.
MacManus noted that Jenkins is less well known than Moody, however, and that’s where she’ll need financial support from Democratic groups outside Florida that have dramatically reduced sending such resources in the past two election cycles.
The Moody campaign did not respond to request for comment.
Other Democrats who have filed to run for the office include Tamika Lyles, Alex Gould, and Paul Ron Cruz. The primary election takes place on Aug. 18, 2026.

The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence is helping to cobble together a set of bills named after Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha, Amanda Grady Sexton, director of public affairs at the coalition, told a roundtable of state officials last week. Fuentes-Huaracha was killed in July by her ex-husband, Michael Gleason, outside the restaurant where she worked, police say.
The goals of the bills: “strengthening statutory protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence, enhancing judicial education, and deepening communication within the courts and between branches of state government,” Sexton said in a statement Tuesday.
Sexton did not provide further details about the content of the bills, which she says the coalition is helping craft with prosecutors, law enforcement, and legislators in both parties. 
“To accomplish this, the Coalition is partnering with Marisol’s loved ones, survivors of abuse, and key stakeholders who serve victims of crime — all with the shared goal of reducing violence in the Granite State,” she said. 
But the promised legislation is one of several proposals for reform in the wake of the Fuentes-Huaracha case that could affect lawmakers’ work. Public officials and lawmakers, many of them Republicans, say the tragedy should be an impetus to improve transparency and accountability in the courts. And some say the bail laws themselves — which were strengthened this year at the urging of Gov. Kelly Ayotte — should be tightened more.
Democrats are more wary. Many had already opposed the stricter bail law, which takes effect Sept. 21, arguing it will deprive defendants of rights.
The new law will repeal the fledgling magistrate system and require that people charged with a serious offense be held behind bars before their arraignment in court. Most significantly, it will lower the standard of proof by which a judge must determine the dangerousness of a defendant in order to deny the defendant bail. Currently, that standard is “clear and convincing evidence”; on Sept. 21, it will be reduced to “probable cause.”
A  2018 effort to advance “statutory protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence” failed to advance in the New Hampshire Legislature after civil rights groups, including the Americans Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, argued it would detract from the rights of defendants.
But those urging further legislative changes are pointing to a litany of failed opportunities listed in a review of the Fuentes-Huaracha case by the judicial branch in a report released late last month. 
“What I’m seeing, and continue to hear, is the issue of discretion being abused in terms of bail decision-making at the court level,” said Executive Councilor John Stephen, a Manchester Republican, in an interview Tuesday.
Asked about any future changes to the bail laws, Ayotte said this year’s legislative fix should be sufficient to change courts’ behavior.
“I was proud to sign a bipartisan law this year to end the failed bail reform social experiment and shut the revolving door for violent criminals in our state,” Ayotte said in a statement Tuesday. “When that law takes effect this month, we will be able to keep violent offenders off our streets and stop preventable tragedies like the murder of Marisol Fuentes in Berlin. I will continue to work every day to protect victims and hold criminals accountable so we can keep New Hampshire the safest state in the nation.”
Calls for accountability
From the coalition’s perspective, the Fuentes-Huaracha case exposed a number of flaws in the judicial system that should be addressed through legislation.
The number of trainings conducted by the judicial branch to inform judges about the signs of abuse and coercion against victims of domestic violence should increase, they say, especially ones to help judges know the signs of abuse when determining whether to issue a protective order or grant bail to a defendant. 
The information on an arrested person, including past arrests and any stalking or domestic violence protective orders they may be subjected to, should be more easily available to law enforcement issues, the coalition says.
And the coalition has said that the statutory definition of abuse in New Hampshire, which hinges on a victim’s “fear for his or her safety or well-being,” should apply to situations of emotional coercion, not just physical danger. 
Stephen has his own wishlist of changes. Since the murder, Stephen and fellow Executive Councilor Joe Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, have conducted a series of forums and listening sessions across the state designed to bring law enforcement and judicial officers together to discuss lessons and solutions.
Stephen, a former homicide prosecutor and assistant attorney general, has arrived at a clear takeaway: The public needs more information about how judges make bail decisions. Speaking Tuesday, he said there is not enough information for people to know how often individual judges are granting bail — and whether there are patterns of leniency.
Stephen also agreed with the coalition about the need for better systems to share information among actors within the system.
But he has stopped short of calling for the bail statute itself to be changed. The changes put in place by this year’s bail reform rollback bill, House Bill 592, should be enough to ensure more people are held that should be held, Stephen argued — particularly with the lowered standard for dangerousness. The key next step, he said, is accountability. 
“I agree wholeheartedly with the governor that we have addressed the significant issue here,” Stephen said. 
“… I do believe, with the probable cause standard in meeting those offenses, that those dangerous criminals will be taken off the road,” he said. “But again, I want to be assured of that.”
An unfinished debate
While Stephen is content to let this year’s bail changes play out, other Republican lawmakers support tightening them further.
Rep. Douglas Trottier, a Belmont Republican, said he would support a bill that would further tie judges’ hands when it comes to setting bail for people repeatedly charged with the same crime.
“One time can be a mistake or a poor judgment for whatever reason, but people that make mistakes, in my opinion, learn from their mistakes,” he said. “If you keep doing it, it’s not a mistake. So we need to hold these people without bail on preventative detention.”
Trottier said he would wait to see how the latest bail reform clawback succeeds, but that he thinks it will likely not be enough. 
Rep. Mike Bordes, a Laconia Republican, also said more legislation to prevent a “revolving door” is necessary. “I think where we started was excellent,” he said Tuesday. “I think it was a step in the right direction. But I do think we do need some more reforms put in place.”
But neither Trottier nor Bordes said they are aware of any specific plans for legislation next year to do so. 
House lawmakers may begin filing bill requests Monday. The final text of any bills is generally not available until early January. 
Democrats, meanwhile, are opposing further changes. Many point to falling crime rates in the state, and raise the risk that stricter bail will mean people will be stuck behind bars for no reason before their trials. 
Rep. David Meuse, a Portsmouth Democrat and a longstanding member of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, declined to comment directly on the potential victims rights legislation until he had seen a copy. 
But in an interview Tuesday, he said he would be skeptical of any further changes to the bail statute. 
“One of the things that does concern me is we have seen a trend, especially over the last couple of years, to take more and more discretion out of the hands of judges,” he said. “We put judges in that position for a reason.”
The new standard by which judges must establish a defendant’s dangerousness for the purpose of determining bail — “probable cause” — is already very low, Meuse said.
Meuse said he supports increasing information-sharing between police departments and courts so that law enforcement and prosecutors have up-to-date information about a defendant’s arrest and bail history. 
He is more cautious about any efforts to increase accountability of judges, though.
“I don’t want us to get into a situation where every time a judge doesn’t happen to make the right call and can’t predict the future like in (the 2002 film) ‘Minority Report,’ that somehow they’re being censured or disciplined or being threatened with impeachment by the Legislature,” he said. “I think accountability is fine, but let’s see what that looks like.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gavelbiglaw-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

The proposal is Democrats attempt to change the maps to a more even Republican-Democratic split in the state. (Photo by Susan Tebben/OCJ)Ohio Democratic lawmakers have introduced their preferred congressional redistricting plan, which they say creates more competitive districts across the state.
In a press conference on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, flanked by several other state Democrats, presented their plan, which reduces the current Republican majority, but still leaves Democrats in the minority.
“What we have proposed follows the law and gives voters the voice they deserve in their congressional representation,” Isaacsohn said.
The congressional map proposed by Ohio legislative Democrats at a Tuesday press conference.
The congressional redraw is required of Ohio this year, because of a lack of bipartisan agreement on the last map, adopted in March 2022.
Both congressional maps previously adopted by the legislature were also struck down as unconstitutionally partisan by the Ohio Supreme Court, though the most recent map stayed in place despite the court ruling.
Right now, Republicans control 10 out of 15 of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional seats, or 66% of the seats. In 2024, Ohioans supported Donald Trump with 55% of the vote.
In the Democrat’s newest map proposal, the districts would have a breakdown of eight Republican and seven Democratic seats, in what Antonio called “the fairest redistricting proposal that either party has put forward.”
That breakdown would leave Republicans with control of 53% of seats compared to 47% for Democrats.
The Ohio General Assembly has until the end of the month to come up with a congressional redistricting plan that must receive 66% approval in both chambers of the legislature.
In order to be approved, the plan must have the support of half the Democrats in the Ohio House and Senate.
If the legislature can’t come to the bipartisan agreement they need by the end of the month, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will be reactivated. The commission has until the end of October to come to bipartisan agreement.
If they reach a stalemate, the process moves back to the legislature, who can then pass maps with a simple majority. Without bipartisan agreement, the legislature will have to redraw the maps again in another four years.

Democratic leaders have already pledged to act as a united front when it comes to pushing the Republican supermajority for maps that are fair to both parties, and maps that align with the voting trends of the state. Those voting trends lean Republican at 55%-44% in an average of statewide elections over the past 10 years.
The Senate leader said the new proposal has seven seats that “lean slightly to the left” and the other eight seats “lean toward the right.”
The biggest Republican majority in the proposed map is District 4 in Northwest Ohio, which would have a 75% Republican majority. District 2 in Southwest Ohio would have a 70% Republican majority.
On the other side of the aisle, the most Democratic district would be District 11, which includes Cleveland, with a 74% Democratic majority. District 3, which includes southern Franklin County would have a 64% Democratic majority.
“This map does not unduly favor or disfavor any party or incumbent,” Antonio said. “Those are the rules.”
Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn said they are open to working together with Republicans, but put their map up in an effort to get the process started, when Republicans have not made moves to introduce a map or start the public hearing process for congressional redistricting.

“If our colleagues, the Republicans, are committed to bipartisanship, then they must join in the urgency and pass a fair, constitutional plan by the end of the month,” Antonio said.
Antonio and Isaacsohn have previously said they are anticipating “another opportunity to gerrymander the districts” from Republicans.
Ohio’s Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has made comments hoping Republicans would give an 80% Republican lean to congressional districts in the state, taking 12 of 15 seats. Moreno won his seat in 2024 with just slightly over 50% of the vote.
At Tuesday’s press conference, Antonio said state Democrats have been in contact with congressional Democrats, but only to talk about the process, not to ask about district preferences.
But Democratic leaders are remaining positive despite the Republican supermajority that could run out the clock on the process.
Ohio’s legislative Republicans not only have a majority in both chambers of the legislature, but they also have a majority in the Ohio Redistricting Commission should the process come to that.
Even if Democrats in the state wanted to take a play out of Texas Democrats’ playbooks and leave the state, Republicans would still have a quorum on the commission.
“If you don’t act, if you don’t propose change, then you have no possibility of ever seeing any kind of change, any kind of progress,” Antonio said.
As the legislature considers their own proposals, the public has the ability to submit their own maps for consideration, which many citizens have already done.
While the Democrats initial plan did not take into account the public proposals already submitted, Antonio said they are “going to consider everything.”
Asked for comment on the Democrat map, the press secretary for the House Majority caucus said “given the process is still in its early stages, the Ohio House Majority will not be commenting on any specific maps at this time.”
A spokesperson for the Ohio Senate Majority did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Jose Carlos Cerdeno Martinez/Getty Images)There are a lot of confusing statistics about health insurance, health care costs, access to care, and other features of our complex health care system circulating around right now. 
Unfortunately, the actual health of our country’s people and communities is often lost among these mostly financial metrics. One of this column’s authors, Don Kollisch, is a doctor who has practiced family medicine in New Hampshire for more than 40 years. He has worked at medical schools and Veterans Affairs (more commonly known as just “the VA”), but his clinical heart is in the rural North Country of our state, where he worked for many years.
Dr. Kollisch was a believer in prevention and worked hard to control the blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol of his patients. One day, covering the ER of his small critical-access hospital, he admitted a man in his 60s who had a stroke that was most likely caused by untreated high blood pressure. The patient lost some speech and some of the use of his right arm and leg. Dr. Kollisch realized, with dismay, that the man lived in a small house near Dr. Kollisch’s own clinic, which he ran 8 miles up the road. The man never came in for treatment of his blood pressure because he worked for a small company and didn’t have health insurance. Food and electricity had to be higher priorities. 
If Dr. Kollisch had any doubts previously about the need for everyone in his community to have health insurance, they were permanently dispelled. He became an advocate for expanding publicly funded health insurance to cover everyone, and he is dismayed that current political trends are moving in the opposite direction, toward people losing rather than gaining insurance coverage.
Congress passed and on July 4 President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the largest ever cut to government health care funding in U.S. history. The Congressional Budget Office projects Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will push about 10 million Americans off of health insurance while growing the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. When combined with the looming expiration of enhanced subsidies for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as “Obamacare”), that uninsurance figure rises to 14.2 million Americans, according to nonpartisan health policy news and analysis organization KFF.
Health economists like author Thomas Lane have studied the link between health insurance and health outcomes. Their work allows us to estimate how many more preventable deaths may occur as health insurance coverage declines, among other outcomes. For example, in a study called the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a lottery was run for people on a waiting list to join Medicaid, and the outcomes of those selected were followed over time and compared to those not selected. By combining the results of studies like these with KFF’s projection of the number of Granite Staters who will lose their health insurance due to the OBBBA and related policy changes, Thomas can project its health impacts.
After doing the math, discomforting results quickly become apparent. New Hampshire can expect to see an extra avoidable death slightly more often than once a week, as well as thousands of other residents cut off from necessary care and medications. Over 5,000 may join the already swollen ranks of those in medical debt.

Make no mistake, however. The craziest part of all of this should not be these figures themselves. It’s the fact that they can mostly still be prevented from coming to fruition by our state Legislature.
KFF estimates that the OBBBA will cost New Hampshire about $230 million per year over the next decade, leaving a big hole for our state legislators to fill. Although some of these harms are caused by Congress’ imposition of work requirements and paperwork burdens on Medicaid beneficiaries that the state cannot do much about, most of the damage comes from the funding cuts. 
Funding cuts are something the state can definitely do something about. It just needs to come up with roughly $230 million on its own.
How exactly can the state find such a large sum of money? Despite the protests of budget hawks, it’s not actually that complicated. Currently, the state runs Medicaid through private third-party administrators, called managed care organizations (MCOs). MCOs are a product of the 1990s, when the public policy world thought the problem with health care was that people were using too much of it, and health care needed gatekeepers. This is an evidence-free claim. Americans actually use less care than people in Europe and Canada despite spending far more per capita, all while living shorter, less healthy lives. If anything, we don’t use enough. Nonetheless, the MCOs still run New Hampshire’s Medicaid program, adding significant administrative expenses onto the state budget while doing nothing to make health care better.
Connecticut got rid of these wasteful MCO contractors in 2012, instead opting to run its Medicaid program itself. Unsurprisingly, they saved lots of money doing so. Nonpartisan health policy research and advocacy organization Physicians for a National Health Program estimates that New Hampshire could save up to $81 million annually from the removal of MCO contracting alone, but changes like this cascade through the Medicaid system and lead to other beneficial effects, too. 
It’s possible to roughly guess what this total effect might look like by simply comparing the difference between what New Hampshire and Connecticut spend on Medicaid per beneficiary. That difference comes out at around $307 million in lower costs annually if New Hampshire’s program had the same costs per beneficiary as Connecticut’s.
That $307 million in potential savings is far more than enough to fill the health care-related $230 million hole in the state budget. With that money, the state can ensure tens of thousands of Granite Staters get the care they need while preventing closures of the countless New Hampshire hospitals and nursing homes that depend on Medicaid for funding.
Other states are starting to consider legislation that would cut out these unnecessary and wasteful Medicaid middlemen. For example, there was a bill in the previous session of the Minnesota legislature called the Patient-Centered Care Act that would more or less copy what Connecticut did (SF1059/HF255). One of us previously wrote a column in support of it, explaining why MCOs are so unhelpful from just about everyone’s perspective, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.
Back then, it was admittedly still uncertain whether Congress would actually pass a massive budget cut package, but it did, and now there are no more excuses. 
Our state Legislature can quite easily alleviate most of the financial problems Congress has passed onto it and thereby save lives. All New Hampshire has to do is copy what Connecticut did and pass a not very big — but in our opinion quite beautiful — bill to cut wasteful MCO middlemen out of our Medicaid program.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/doctorcomp-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-10 05:56:17.068849

Attorneys representing several Ohio officials including Republican state Treasurer Robert Sprague want a judge to dismiss the class action lawsuit challenging the use of unclaimed funds to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium.
In a pair of filings, they reject the lawsuit as a “misguided challenge” and the plaintiffs’ objections as “conspiratorial ramblings.”
Far from coming up with some novel workaround to take ordinary Ohioans’ money, “the law is both mundane and entirely within the state’s prerogative,” the state’s attorneys argue. “The state’s right to manage, dispose of, and take title to abandoned property has been established for hundreds of years.”
If the plaintiffs are so worried about the state taking their property, one filing repeatedly asks, why don’t they just claim it?
The state’s lawyers have filed a motion to break up the class of plaintiffs and another to dismiss the case outright.

Background
The case centers on the most recent state budget. The Cleveland Browns were seeking $600 million in state dollars to help to pay for a new $2.5 billion stadium in Brook Park. Republican lawmakers came up with a clever plan to pay for it without raising taxes.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

They could just take the money from ordinary Ohioans.
The state manages a pool of nearly $5 billion in unclaimed funds. That money is made up of forgotten assets — things like old bank accounts, security deposits or insurance policies. It’s a big chunk of what state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, has called “lazy money.” It’s just sitting in an account generating interest, but little else. He argued, why not put some of it to use?
The Ohio Senate’s budget plan moves money that has gone unclaimed for more than 10 years to a new cultural and sports facilities fund. Rightful owners would have 10 more years to come forward, but after that, they’d lose any claim over their money. The Ohio House didn’t object, and when the budget landed on Gov. DeWine’s desk, he didn’t either.
Two attorneys and former Democratic lawmakers, Jeff Crossman and Marc Dann, filed a class action lawsuit claiming the state’s plan amounts to stealing. Looking to eminent domain law, they said the state has to jump through several hoops before taking possession of a citizen’s property, but Ohio officials had done none of that.
Democratic former Ohio lawmakers threaten lawsuit over Cleveland Browns stadium funding plan

In the most recent filings, attorneys representing Ohio’s treasurer, the Department of Commerce director, the Division of Unclaimed Funds superintendent, and the executive director of the state facilities construction commission, pushed back.
“The complaint is nothing more than an expression of plaintiffs’ belief that the law makes for bad public policy,” the state’s attorneys said. “Plaintiffs, however, are not entitled to use this lawsuit to substitute their judgment for that of the state’s duly elected representatives.”
Standing & class status
To bring a lawsuit, a plaintiff needs to demonstrate ‘standing’ — that they’ve been harmed, the defendant caused that harm and the court could fix it. In its filings, the state poked holes in class action’s claims of standing. With a website available for people to reclaim property, what harm has occurred? Anyone who believes the state of Ohio has custody of their property can file a claim, right now, to get their property back.
“Plaintiffs here simply ignored (and continue to ignore) the available administrative procedure entirely,” the state’s attorneys write. “By deciding not to file claims under that process, they plan to cause their own injury and lack standing to claim that defendants are at fault.”
What’s more, they questioned whether any injury exists at all, much less the “actual, imminent and concrete injury” plaintiffs need to demonstrate standing. Although state lawmakers set a deadline for claims, that cutoff isn’t until 2036.
“Thus, no matter what, plaintiffs have had, and will have, more than ten years until they could theoretically experience a loss of their property,” the state contends. “That is hardly ‘imminent.’”
The state’s lawyers argue the case is “far too speculative, remote, and abstract” to meet the requirements. Because no property becomes truly unrecoverable until 2036, no actual harm occurs until then either. By extension, the case won’t be “ripe” until then for court review. Because the plaintiffs haven’t taken advantage of the readily available administrative process for reclaiming their property, it’s not necessary for the court to intervene.
In a separate filing, the state’s legal team argued there’s little that binds the supposed class together. People with property in Ohio’s unclaimed funds trust might prompt similar questions, but the state’s attorneys contend the point of a class action is to deliver a singular answer for the entire group.
The state’s attorneys explain the federal government preempts disputes over money from FDIC-protected accounts. And because the state will only take over funds that have been in the trust for ten or more years, not every claimant would fit in the class.
“Given the vast differences within the proposed class,” they insist, “these questions will require individualized answers, which will depend on multiple factors that would require a claimant-by-claimant analysis.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
For 60 years, Head Start has provided child care for the most vulnerable children in the United States with little controversy.
It was established by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1965, and supported by a slew of Republicans since, including Richard Nixon, who called it “valuable”; Ronald Reagan, who established Head Start Awareness Month in the 1980s; and George H. W. Bush, who increased its funding. Legislators from both parties have supported Head Start, which operates in all 50 states, and is the only child care option available in some rural parts of the country.
This year, though, politics came to the door of Head Start. Caught in the political crosshairs of the Trump administration, the program is facing unprecedented upheaval that could shutter child care centers and, as many of Head Start experts who spoke to The 19th see it, fundamentally alter the program.
“For me and for a lot of other directors, trust has been deeply broken,” said Jen Bailey, executive director of Reach Dane, which operates 17 child care centers in Wisconsin and offers Head Start services. “The mission is we serve the neediest of the needy and poorest of the poor. For us, changing that would violate the mission of Head Start.”
The program, which now serves about 700,000 children, was created to support low-income families. It provides free child care to children ages 3 to 5 (Early Head Start serves those under 3) and offers a wide array of services for the entire family, including prenatal support, health screenings and connecting parents to job training, housing and food assistance.
But the Trump administration has dealt several financial blows to the program this year. At one point, it looked like Head Start may be eliminated completely.
And more recently, the future of Head Start has been thrown into uncertainty by an unprecedented directive from the administration: Programs are to ban undocumented children from Head Start entirely.
Attorneys general in 21 Democratic-led states have sued the federal government over this rule, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has agreed to halt enforcement in those states until September 11. As programs wait for additional guidance on whether they will have to implement that change, the mood is one of unease, confusion and fear, according to interviews with nearly two dozen Head Start experts across the country, including providers, state association directors and federal workers.
There’s a discomfort over just how much the politics of the moment has reached their programs. They don’t want to say anything that could turn D.C.’s attention on them.
At the same time, they are trying to continue to serve Head Start families, knowing that soon, some of them could be barred from it. Because the work they do is so deeply connected with the populations the Trump administration is targeting, they are now weighing a moral dilemma: If Head Start changed, could they stay?
“We would have staff say, ‘I don’t want to work in a program that has this eligibility criteria.’ And I would understand that,” Bailey said.
Already, her centers are seeing dips in attendance from families who are afraid they will get caught in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid as they bring their kids in. About 70,000 undocumented people live in Wisconsin, according to the Migration Policy Institute; Reach Dane’s centers serve some 1,000 children.
Bailey told her staff that although the political rhetoric has changed, their core values have not. Reach Dane is not making any changes until more guidance arrives from Washington. But if they were forced to check for immigration status, she’s not sure she could stay.
“If it came to the point where it could not take care of staff and kids and families at some sort of basic level, I wouldn’t be able to ethically sit in that space,” said Bailey, who has worked in Head Start for 25 years.

Project 2025, the 900-page document from the conservative Heritage Foundation that has turned into a policy blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second term, dedicates one paragraph to Head Start. Citing “rampant abuse” of children and “lack of positive outcomes,” advising: Eliminate Head Start.
While there have been documented cases of abuse and neglect at Head Start programs, it still has one of the most rigorous safety standards in American child care (the incidents affected fewer than 1 in 1,000 children, according to the Administration for Children and Families, the division that oversees Head Start), and the issues are not unique to Head Start. Numerous studies have also found positive outcomes both in the short and long term for children enrolled in the program.
In April, a leaked White House budget showed the Trump administration was angling to eliminate Head Start altogether, claiming it used a “radical” curriculum that gave preference to undocumented children and embraced diversity, equity and inclusion. In response, the National Head Start Association sent an open letter to the president signed by 50,000 Head Start parents and alumni.
The letter-writing campaign would grow to number nearly 500,000, and state Head Start associations also mobilized to speak out against the program’s elimination. Ultimately, it worked. Head Start received flat funding from Congress — what amounts to a budget cut when accounting for inflation.
Still, the programs have taken economic hits — in some cases, ones they could barely recover from. Shortly after Trump took office at the end of January, funding to programs was cut off as part of a government-wide freeze. At least 45 programs serving nearly 20,000 children across 23 states spent days and weeks waiting for money to come down. The true number is likely much higher, experts said.
April Mullins-Datko, the Head Start director at ADVOCAP, a community action agency in Wisconsin that provides Head Start services, said her funding was delayed for more than a month. They used some reserve funds and took out a line credit to stay open.
“We were limping. Robbing Peter and paying Paul,” said Mullins-Datko, a 20-year Head Start veteran who was a Head Start child herself in the 1980s. Her twins also went through the program.
A Government Accountability Office report released in July found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it withheld funds from programs that had already been approved by Congress. Between January 20 and April 15, Head Start grantees received $825 million less in funding when compared to the same period in 2024.
Another headwind arrived in April. Five of the 10 regional offices that support Head Start and other child care programs suddenly closed as part of a reduction of the federal workforce. All were in blue states. Programs in 22 states lost specialists who helped them navigate challenges with funding, who served as the first points of contact if a safety incident occurred. The remaining offices, which were already shortstaffed, took on entire states’ caseloads.
Katie Hamm, who oversaw the Head Start program in her role as the deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development for the Biden administration, called it “a game of whack-a-mole, where you think you solved a new issue and here comes another one.” Hamm left the role in January 2025.
But what has really rattled Head Start is the change on immigration. Since the new guidance on undocumented children was issued in July, programs have been in something of a holding pattern.
Fundamentally, the guidance redefines Head Start and other HHS programs as a “federal public benefit,” or in other words, welfare. Head Start has never been defined as a form of welfare, said Allison Siebeneck, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, one of the groups suing the federal government over the changes to Head Start. Welfare reform in the 1990s specifically excluded K-12 and early childhood from the definition of a “federal public benefit,” she said: “They could have included it, and they didn’t.”
Redefining Head Start means only U.S. citizens or “qualified aliens” can access the program, excluding undocumented children but also those who are seeking asylum, those with U visas such as victims of serious crimes, those with temporary protected status and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
When the Trump administration published its rule change, it argued that undocumented immigrants “should not burden” our benefits system. The change was effective immediately.
The new rules came with no additional information on how programs are to screen families. Programs are still waiting for implementation guidance from the federal Office of Head Start. Thousands of teachers, parents and Head Start alumni, meanwhile, have submitted comments in the federal registrar responding to the change, many of them condemning it.
The rule change does include an exemption for nonprofits that offer Head Start services, which is about 70 percent of all programs, but the administration noted that all programs, regardless of the exemption, are encouraged to “pay heed to the clear expressions of national policy” and screen students for immigration status. Siebeneck called it a “thinly veiled threat.”
“You have one statute that says you’re exempt,” she said, “but when you go to sign for your grant you also have to sign a certification saying you’re in compliance with federal law.”
Program directors, who already saw what it was like to suddenly lose funding earlier in the year, are now afraid to lose their grants altogether if they don’t comply with the requirement. Some may comply before exact guidance is released or regardless of nonprofit status.
In Illinois, Lauri Morrison-Frichtl, executive director of the Illinois Head Start Association, said one Head Start director has decided not to enroll children if they find out the family is undocumented.
“They don’t want to do something that gets them in trouble. Our programs follow the rules,” Morrison-Frichtl said. “They are not rule breakers.”

“It’s an odd moment that what we’ve always been doing has now turned into the politics of the moment,” reflected Mullins-Datko, the Head Start program director in Wisconsin. “We can usually find common ground with our children no matter what our politics are because typically we all want the same things for our children: We want them to thrive, we want them to be healthy, we want them to get a good education — that’s why Head Start has enjoyed bipartisan support throughout its history.”
Many Head Start providers would love to return to a time when Head Start wasn’t political, when their primary concern was how to better serve the families and children in their care with the resources they had. Others feel like the mission of Head Start — to protect those most in need — has moved them to speak up at a time when those communities are being targeted.
“Head Start has been around for 11 administrations and 60 years and have never seen these types of asks of us changing our approach to eligibility and enrollment, despite Congress having a lot of opportunities to do that,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association.
The national group is in touch with members across both sides of the aisle who support Head Start. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Sheridan said, has expressed support for the program, saying in May that he would “be very sad” if programs shut their doors and adding that he “fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.” Nevertheless, the changes to Head Start have taken place under Kennedy’s leadership at HHS.
It’s now a matter of, “How do we move Head Start out of the way of politics?” Sheridan said.
In Indiana, Rhett Cecil, the head of the state’s Head Start Association, is also trying to keep the conversation nonpartisan.
“There’s no agenda in Head Start,” he said.“I find it remarkably refreshing in a polarized society.”
Cecil is waiting for guidance on implementing the immigration change from the federal Office of Head Start, but said it’s not something his members have thought through much yet. “Our programs will adhere to the standards of Head Start,” he said. About 100,000 undocumented immigrants live in Indiana, putting it in the middle of the pack among states in terms of population.
“Here’s what’s changed in Indiana,” Cecil said: “Nothing.”
Megan Woller, the executive director of the Idaho Head Start Association, said providers in her state are worried about scaring families away and bringing too much attention to Head Start.
“Idaho is a political climate that is right in line with the Trump administration. My state association colleagues across the country who all live in different political climates are advocating in very vocal ways and are banding together,” Woller said. “My members have not wanted to do that. There is a fear of being too vocal and causing a big stink and putting too much focus on Head Start.”
But in other parts of the country, programs have been moved to speak up. Four Head Start state associations and two parent organizations are named plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump administration. All are blue or purple states — Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Oregon and California.
In more conservative states, few programs and Head Start Associations were willing to speak to The 19th about this year’s changes. But for some in red states the immigration directive feels like a step too far.
Julie Stone, who leads the Ohio Head Start Association, said the immigration change represents a fundamental shift for programs.
“We are about meeting families where they are. We are about doing what’s right for children,” Stone said. “We’ve never been required to establish their status, but we know their parents are working and we know we have them in a safe and nourishing environment.”
And ICE enforcement is only ramping up. The agency’s annual budget is set to triple. That makes her anxious, “knowing there will be more enforcement and we are somehow … getting wrapped up in this,” Stone said.
Multiple programs and state Head Start agencies told The 19th that the political rhetoric around immigration is distorting the reality of who the families who rely on Head Start are, what they contribute to their communities and why the program is needed.
“What I know to be true about Head Start: The majority of [the families] go to work,” said Jennie Mauer, the head of the Wisconsin Head Start Association. Many of those undocumented families in her state work in the dairy industry, which relies on migrant workers to operate. Those workers, an estimated 70 percent of the dairy workforce, need somewhere to put their children.
Otherwise, how will the Dairy State continue to be the Dairy State?
“We can have all that [political] rhetoric, but I want safe communities and I want safe children,” Mauer said. “I do not believe that coming to Head Start and putting these questions to families who are just trying to go to work is the way to do it.”

In Detroit, this year of upheaval has already led to the closure of a Head Start program, leaving 324 children without child care.
The center, called Focus: HOPE, had been receiving Head Start funding as part of a consortium of three programs. Last year, the consortium disbanded and each program applied individually. CEO Portia Roberson said her program tried to put together a grant application that aligned with the priorities of the new administration, noting that it served “all” children.
They were supposed to hear back about their grant in March, but nothing came. Michigan was one of the states that lost its regional office in April, meaning the staff that ensured grants were evenly spaced so communities didn’t lose Head Start services were gone.
By July 31, still not having heard anything, the money ran dry. Focus: HOPE laid off nearly 100 staff members and announced the closure of their Head Start services. Roberson expected parents to be angry with her. But instead, she said, “they were here to figure out how they could support what we are doing and to let people know how important we are for their families.”
In mid-August, the program learned its grant application had been denied. No explanation was given at first — they later learned that one of the providers in the consortium, Starfish Family Services, had received the funding Focus: HOPE expected to go to them.
“The current administration talks about wanting to build a workforce. My question is how do parents become a part of this workforce if there is no safe and educational place to put their children?” she said. Now, “I’m taking people out of the workforce.”
Roberson is hoping Starfish will take them back in as a subgrantee, which will allow her to service the families in their care. If that happens, she will then have to consider what those services would look like with the new immigration changes.
“What gets lost in all of this is we are just trying to help people who need help. We are not making decisions around race or class or political party,” she said. “
She doesn’t know how she could enforce the immigration directive. If it came down to protecting children from being removed, Roberson said, Focus: HOPE would do “whatever needs to be done.”

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)At her first campaign event focused on affordable housing, Democratic candidate Hannah Pingree said making it accessible to more Mainers needs to be a top issue for whoever becomes the state’s next governor. 
Joined by municipal and state housing leaders at the Bangor Public Library Tuesday, the former head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future (GOPIF) and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives highlighted the progress Maine has already made, but said “there is a lot more work to be done.”
“I think it’s important that the next governor make this the top issue,” Pingree said. The event was held at the close of the MaineHousing Affordable Housing conference and launched Pingree’s statewide housing tour. Pingree will be holding events over the next few months to bring together various stakeholders — from renters to developers — to work on solutions to the state’s housing challenges.
Earlier that day, Mills gave the opening remarks at the conference, during which she highlighted Pingree’s work. As head of GOPIF, Pingree authorized nearly $315 million to support the construction of new affordable homes across the state, which Mills said was “nearly five times more than the total amount spent on housing from 2000 to 2018.”
Pingree said while working for the Mills administration, which she joined in 2019, she realized that “housing was this fundamental challenge that was starting to impact Maine, and it was impacting every part of our economy, every part of every community across the state.”
“We’ve made some progress. We’ve done some good work on housing, but we need to double the space or triple the space to meet the demand,” she added.
Despite increasing construction, Maine still needs 84,000 new affordable housing units while 5,000 children remain unhoused, Pingree said.
The housing tour presents the first major campaign events for Pingree, who is among a crowded field of candidates for the Democratic nomination to replace Mills, who terms out next year. Though the governor has yet not officially endorsed anyone in the June 6 primary race, which includes Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and former Senate President Troy Jackson, among others, Pingree is seen as Mills’ chosen successor. 
During the event, Pingree asked panelists to share what they view as the most pressing housing challenges, possible municipal solutions as well as what the next governor should do to address homelessness and the lack of housing.
Rep. Traci Gere (D-Kennebunkport), who chairs the Housing and Economic Development Committee, and Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) highlighted the increasing homelessness in many Maine communities. 
Bangor officials pointed to local initiatives that will help alleviate homelessness in the city, including the newly opened Theresa’s Place, a refurbished building project by the nonprofit Penquis that added 41 subsidized studio and one-bedroom apartments for low income residents. 
Pingree said the goal of the tour is to listen and learn about what people believe the next governor should do to address Maine’s housing shortage.
The next stops include Biddeford on Sept. 16, Portland on Sept. 26, Auburn on Sept. 29, Berwick on Oct. 2, Dover-Foxcroft on Oct. 6, Ellsworth on Oct. 10, and Rockland on Oct. 14, with additional stops to be announced.

Of course the Republican U.S. senator from Kansas denies that he’s anything of the sort, but his lengthy interview on Face the Nation should appall anyone who cares about public health. He told host Margaret Brennan that certain vaccines weren’t needed in certain cases, that other vaccines had been overhyped and that everyone just needed to stop worrying so much about COVID-19. Marshall has tossed moms and babies overboard in his eagerness to appease anti-science conspiracy-mongers.
His capitulation to wingnuttery would be hilarious if it wasn’t so deeply dangerous.
But let’s look at the interview. Let’s examine his statements and really think about them. Thankfully, CBS posted a complete transcript, so we can hang on every syllable. Not that I would recommend it.
Marshall: “In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don’t think there’s many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they’re old enough to vote.”
Note the word used here: “Jabs.” That’s an aggressive, painful word. He doesn’t use “inoculations” or even “vaccinations.” No, he says “jabs.”
Why? What’s he trying to convey?
Marshall also emphasizes the number 76. That sounds big and scary and unacceptable, fit for a protest sign. In reality, vaccines are given in multiple doses to maximize immune response. You can see the CDC vaccination chart below; it’s not secret. There are vaccines against 19 illnesses listed, including flu shots and a couple based on individual circumstances.
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
The only reason to use that number is for Marshall to curry favor with folks who reject the astonishing advances of modern science. That would include Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., who apparently rejects the germ theory of disease.
Has Marshall joined the secretary in his skepticism? Has he thrown off the tyranny of germ-focused medicine to focus on battling spirits of illness instead?
But we need to press forward.
Marshall on the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is given to newborns: “If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she’s in a stable, monogamous relationship, she’s not doing IV drugs, she’s not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there’s zero chance that that baby’s going to have Hepatitis. Now, there’s other moms that — or other babies that do need it, OK. We need to be more specific. We can’t be overly prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she’s an IV drug-abuser, if she’s not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well?”
Absolute bull hockey. To respond, I’ll turn to fellow Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. He’s also a physician, and he posted this Twitter thread:
“Not all mothers have prenatal care. Some get infected between testing in the first trimester and delivery. In some cases, the test is overlooked. If a child is infected at birth, they have a 95% chance of becoming chronically infected UNLESS, they get one dose of hepatitis B vaccine. If they do, they have less than a 5% chance of being chronically infected.
“If someone is infected at birth, they have a much higher chance of developing liver cancer and of spreading hepatitis B to others.
“The vaccine is safe as proven by study after study. MAHA starts with preventing vaccine preventable diseases.”
To understand the moral imperative here, we need to step way back. Most illnesses don’t permanently harm people. But most smokers don’t die of lung cancer, either. Vaccines and common health ensure that when exceptions happen, you and your family and loved ones will be protected. If only one person in 1,000 dies from a preventable illness, we still have 330 million people in the United States, and 3 million in Kansas.
Over time, vaccines and good health advice reduce the number of folks unlucky enough to fall ill. That one in 1,000 becomes one in 10,000, or one in a million.
As decades pass, because of the sheer quantity, vast numbers of lives are saved. Children are born to parents who might otherwise have died. Those children have children of their own and so on.
Vaccines are one of the single biggest pro-life inventions of the modern age.
Marshall: “Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to COVID vaccine? Why can’t we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide.”
Well, because of people like you, senator. You chose to embrace the rhetoric and outright grift of snake-oil salesmen rather than support basic public health measures. You even made a fuss about taking hydroxychloroquine to supposedly protect yourself from COVID-19!
What gall to suggest that Americans somehow behave irrationally when they want to protect themselves from the wave of infection that you enabled for the past half-decade?


As I stated at the beginning of this column, Marshall emphatically rejects the suggestion that he opposes vaccines. He tried to eat his cake and have to too by telling Brennan: “Before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I’ve raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.”
He can say that. He may even believe it. I personally believe that Marshall should be ashamed.
I expect he would have problems if random Kansans posted a sign and started calling themselves OB-GYNs. I expect he would protest to medical authorities if those people started delivering babies without education or licensure.
Marshall trained for his job. He worked hard. He knows information and best practices that everyday people don’t. For a quarter-century, he worked as an expert.
Most people are not medical experts, either about delivering babies or vaccination schedules. They aren’t trained about infant and childhood health. They are trying to make it through a challenging world and make the best decisions possible for their families.
The commonly used childhood vaccine schedule does that. It allows doctors and nurses, who are already pressured by the demands of our health care system, to ensure that the greatest number of people receive the greatest benefit from the miracle drugs known as vaccines.
When our son was born, my husband and I were happy to see doctors vaccinate him against Hepatitis B. Not because we thought it likely, but because it put our minds at rest. We were happy to watch him complete the full round of childhood vaccines. Again, not because we thought dire illnesses were circulating, but because we knew they would safeguard his health if worse came to worse
Follow the recommended vaccine schedule. Listen to your doctors. Protect the health of those you love and everyone else.
Marshall has betrayed the babies he delivered and the mothers who turned to him for care. He has sacrificed his decades of experience to worship at the golden calf of RFK Jr. and anti-science charlatans. Our nation and this state will suffer the consequences.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)When politicians feel compelled to fix what ain’t broke their motivations for proposing solutions in search of a problem are probably less than pure. 
Political mischief to muck up what works or put the kibosh on ideas to improve outcomes is a means to self-serving ends. 
Take the slew of voting bills Ohio lawmakers have teed up for passage in the Statehouse. 
None were crafted to encourage greater voter participation. None took pains to eliminate contrived obstacles to voting or to create more access, ease and opportunity to facilitate citizens engagement in their government. 
Nearly every piece of legislation winding its way through the General Assembly would make it harder for Ohioans to vote by adding new layers of unnecessary restrictions, administrative burdens, and preemptive bans to effectively throttle the process and discourage turnout. 
Concocting excessive hurdles that eligible voters must clear before casting a ballot in Ohio means many might not bother. 
Which appears to be the point of several anti-voter bills in the legislature draped in the deceptive cover of “protecting election integrity” or “securing our elections.”  
State legislators who float extreme remedies for imaginary voting issues have to camouflage their disenfranchisement campaign somehow. 
But people are catching on to the endless legislative encroachment of groundless voting barriers in Ohio from one of the most restrictive voter-ID laws in the country to sharply limited drop boxes and shortened windows for voters to fix provisional ballot errors, return vote-by-mail ballots, and vote early in-person.

It is becoming increasingly clear to many Ohioans that political self-preservation, not expanding access to voting or making it easier to register and participate, is what drives policymakers in Ohio to continually curb the voting power of citizens. 
Think about it. If too many Ohioans can too easily jettison extremist politicians who don’t represent their values or vote for citizen-led initiatives that repeal widely opposed legislation, they threaten the politicians who gerrymandered themselves into unaccountable supermajorities in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate. 
The entrenched powerful, who pretty much do as they please with impunity, cannot allow voters to interfere with a good thing, so they erect gratuitous roadblocks to suppress voting in the state.  
Ohio Republican legislators, occasionally joined by equally self-serving Democrats, have been on a tear to impose new impediments to voting since the GOP decided to exploit Donald Trump’s Big Lie — about massive voting fraud rigging the 2020 election — to enact all manner of obstructive voting laws under the guise of “election integrity.”  
It is an insidious ruse to erode voting rights and disenfranchise those unable to jump through arbitrary hoops to exercise those rights.
But the partisan hits keep coming to silence the voices of the poor, the young, the disabled, the elderly. 
Anyone without the means, mobility, or mastery to navigate the stream of unwarranted changes in state election laws can lose the chance to be heard. 
Ohio Senate Bill 153 is one of the more outrageous schemes to affront Ohio voters in the current legislative session.
It would throw an indefensible wrench into voter registration with proof of citizenship requirements to fix the virtually nonexistent problem of noncitizens voting in elections.
The offense, which is already prohibit by state and federal laws and efficiently blocked by vigilant election oversight, is so statistically rare in Ohio that it literally happens zero percent in the state.  
Requiring all Ohioans to provide documentary proof of citizenship whenever they register to vote or change their name or address, in legislation mirroring a GOP congressional measure, could, for no evidence-based justification, keep scores of legally qualified voters who do not have or cannot easily access such documents from voting. 
Yet the co-sponsors of Ohio Senate Bill 153, Bowling Green Republican Theresa Gavarone (a Senate go-to on voter suppression bills) and Andrew Brenner of Delaware plow ahead with their legislation to undermine the power of the vote and citizen initiatives while framing their attacks on voters as “common sense” and a ”simple fix” to ensure “trust and integrity” in the voting system they are gutting.
Senate Bill 63, another Gavarone special that also takes power away from voters was co-sponsored by Columbus Democrat Bill DeMora and, with minimal debate, was passed in the Senate with bipartisan support and sent to the Ohio House. 
It would prohibit ranked choice voting (RCV) — where voters rank multiple candidates on their ballot instead of picking just one — on the state level and punish local municipalities that allow it in their own elections by cutting off government funding. 
Why the rush to preemptively ban voting reform that arguably encourages political moderation, may provide a guardrail against extremism in both parties, gives voters more choices and a more broadly popular winner who appeals to a majority of the electorate? 
Is it because RCV poses a threat to dug in power protected by gerrymandering?
Those safe seats are decided in primaries where partisan extremists often prevail, and Ohio Republicans have just revived efforts to pass a bill to preserve that partisan advantage by restricting who can participate in primary elections. 
Ohio House Bill 320, introduced by Sandusky County right-winger Gary Click, would close primary voting to only Ohioans who register 90 days in advance as Republicans or Democrats. 
That proposed fix would lock primary voters out of the election process at a decisive stage if they don’t declare party affiliation somewhere in time. A needless bar not to improve outcomes but as a means to broken ends.

Mesha Mainor argues in support of a school voucher bill. Ousted from the Legislature after switching parties, MAinor is running as a Republican to be the next state school superintendent. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA former state representative who switched parties over Georgia’s school voucher plan is joining the race for Georgia School Superintendent as a Republican.
Former Democrat Mesha Mainor became the state Legislature’s first Black Republican woman when she joined the GOP in 2023 following friction over her full-throated support of a proposed voucher bill that passed with her support. The program, which began this year, allows some parents to receive $6,500 in state funds from their local school district if they take their child out of public school and place them into private school or educate them at home.
“I’m running to give parents a voice, protect our children, and make Georgia the number one place to educate a child no matter where the child lives,” Mainor said in a statement announcing her candidacy. “Excellence in Georgia’s classrooms will no longer be a vision. Together with the phenomenal teachers of Georgia in every classroom, school administrators, all school staff, and policy leaders — Georgia will be the number one state to live, work, and educate.”

Kemp signed the controversial voucher bill last April, and Mainor lost her seat the following November, receiving only 16% of the vote in her heavily Democratic district. Mainor and other voucher supporters say they help children in low-performing districts attain a good education that would otherwise be out of reach. Opponents say the program shuffles state dollars into private institutions with little oversight or quality control.
In a phone call Tuesday, Mainor said if she is elected, she will consider expanding the state’s voucher program and work to promote curriculum transparency. She said she will promote workforce readiness in addition to academics, and ensure children are not “indoctrinated” in the classroom, a common concern among rightwing education advocates.
Three other Republicans also have their eyes on becoming Georgia’s next top educator, but they will all have to first convince GOP voters that a change is needed. Three-term incumbent Richard Woods announced his re-election campaign earlier this summer.
Mainor said she’s the best person for the job because of her experience, including founding a language immersion school.
“No other candidate can say ‘I’ve been a legislator before,’ and right now, right at this moment, I know what it’s like to be a parent for a K-12 child and one that just recently went to college,” she said.
Mainor said GOP primary voters can trust her to carry out a conservative agenda despite her past membership with the Democratic Party because she has the zeal of a convert.
“It’s those new Christians that often have more faith than old Christians,” she said. “So to say that I just switched parties, what it means is that I understand what the value systems are of the Republican Party, and that’s why I made such a dramatic switch. It was not easy to make the switch. I was ridiculed. I had racist attacks put on me. I mean, if you look back at my social media after I switched parties, that was a very trying and traumatic time for me, but I stood strong because I was convicted in why I was changing parties.”

Woods, who was first elected in 2014, previously worked for three decades as a teacher and school administrator. Next year will represent the first time Woods has faced multiple primary challengers since he came into office. In 2018 and 2022, he faced off against former state superintendent John Barge but won by comfortable margins both times.
“As State School Superintendent, I have focused on transforming the Georgia Department of Education from a compliance-oriented agency to one centered on service and support for school districts,” Woods said in a June statement announcing his candidacy. “That vision will continue and, as I seek a fourth term, I am committed to expanding the resources and supports we provide directly to teachers.”
Woods is one of Georgia’s few statewide office holders not restricted by term limits or seeking higher office in 2026, but he’s still attracted a line of people hoping to take his job.
Among the Republicans competing with Mainor to take Woods’ seat in May’s GOP primary will be Fred “Bubba” Longgrear, a 29-year educator who currently serves as superintendent in Candler County, Randell Trammell, president and CEO of the Georgia Center for Civic Engagement, a nonprofit focused on expanding civics education, and businesswoman Nelva Lee.
Woods enters the race with more than $58,000 cash on hand, according to financial disclosures. Trammell, the only other candidate to have filed a financial disclosure, reported just over $51,000 in his pocket after loaning his campaign $20,000.
No Democrat has so far announced or filed paperwork to run.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)STURGIS — In a speech formally launching his campaign for Congress on Tuesday, South Dakota Republican Marty Jackley signaled a desire to bring workers into the country legally while preventing unauthorized immigration.
“We need to have a national immigration policy that considers public safety and the workforce,” Jackley said. “We need to have E-Verify and visas working. I promise you I’ll be committed to doing that as your congressman.”
E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the United States. The system has been beset with well-chronicled problems, including a Cato Institute study alleging thousands of people lost out on jobs because E-Verify incorrectly flagged them.
State lawmaker files statement of candidacy to run for U.S. House

Jackley made his campaign announcement at the Loud American restaurant and bar in Sturgis, on the edge of the Black Hills, where many employers in the area depend on workers with visas to fill seasonal tourism jobs. A visa is a document granting foreigners permission to visit, work or study in the country.
Jackley serves as South Dakota’s attorney general. He’ll continue in that role through next year while running for Congress. There’s an open race for the state’s lone U.S. House seat next year, because Republican South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In Jackley’s speech to a room packed with dozens of supporters, he touched on his crime-fighting credentials and his experience serving on a council that advised President Donald Trump on law enforcement issues.
On economic development, Jackley pledged to work toward a “fair playing field” and boasted of winning a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair, which paved the way for states to force certain online retailers to pay state sales taxes. Jackley said the ability to avoid sales taxes gave online retailers an unfair advantage over local stores.
He also recapped his record on government accountability, including his prosecution of six cases since last year against former state employees for allegations related to their work for state government.
In one of the highest-profile cases, Jackley won a guilty verdict at trial in April against a former Department of Social Services worker who stole $1.8 million from the state over a 13-year period. In response to the rash of state employee crimes, Jackley also supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
“I brought legislation so that we can better protect the taxpayer dollars and what’s been going on in Pierre, and I’ll do the same thing if you send me to Washington,” he said.

If Jackley wins, he would be the first person with roots in South Dakota’s less populated West River region — the area west of the Missouri River — to represent the state in the U.S. House since Republican John Thune held the seat from 1997 to 2003. Thune, whose hometown is Murdo, is now the U.S. Senate majority leader.
Jackley, 54, grew up in Sturgis and still has a ranch in the area, along with another ranch near Pierre. After earning an electrical engineering degree from South Dakota Mines, he added a law degree from the University of South Dakota. He served as the U.S. attorney for South Dakota from 2006 to 2009, and then as attorney general for the state from 2009 to 2019.
Term limits prevented him from seeking another consecutive term as attorney general in the 2018 elections. He sought the Republican nomination for governor that year and lost by 12 points in the primary election to Kristi Noem, who went on to serve as governor until leaving earlier this year to lead the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for Trump. Jackley ran for attorney general again in 2022 and was unopposed in the general election.
Besides Jackley, at least one other Republican — state Sen. Casey Crabtree of Madison — has formed a fundraising committee to potentially seek the U.S. House seat. That sets up a possible race in the primary election on June 2, 2026, to determine the Republican nominee before the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.
Democrats may have their own U.S. House primary race with at least three federal statements of candidacy filed so far by Scott Schlagel of Dell Rapids, and Billy Mawhiney and Nikki Gronli, both of Sioux Falls.
Jackley’s candidacy for U.S. House creates an open race for attorney general next year. At least one person — Lance Russell, the Republican state’s attorney of Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties — has announced his intention to seek the job.

Right-wing legislators, advocacy groups, and dark-money donors are trying to dictate what can be taught, which books can be read, and which speakers are welcome on our campuses.
While some lawmakers at the state and national levels have moved to restrict the instruction of topics like race, gender, and history, the Pam Bondi-led Department of Justice-issued guidance on July 29 is designed to handcuff universities and K-12 schools, threatening “significant legal risks” should universities and school districts continue with time-tested, data-proven initiatives to support students.
Is every right-of-center legislator, especially those in locally elected positions, part of the systematic coup against education and our democratic experiment? Of course not, but private dissent is a fool’s errand. Where are their voices? The outspoken redirect to local issues but unlike any other time, national is local.

Christopher M. Piscitelli
The attack on DEI programs, targeting of our LGBTQ+ students, the attempt to push a false version of history into our classrooms is part of a larger platform to reimagine America as a right-wing wet dream. They’re weaponizing fear and exploiting apathy with a goal of tearing down our hallmark institutions by turning them into ideological battlegrounds.
Our greatest fictitious president, Andrew Shepherd, [from the 1995 film, The American President] said it best: “[they] are only interested two things, making you afraid of it and telling you who’s to blame for it.”
Democracy is being tested, not in our history books, but right now. It is not whether we say the right things, but whether we do the right things. In his 1961 Inaugural Address, John F. Kennedy said, “every one of us is in a position of responsibility; and, in the final analysis, the kind of government we get depends upon how we fulfill those responsibilities. We, the people, are the boss, and we will get the kind of political leadership, be it good or bad, that we demand and deserve.”
Before the public trust in universities erodes, we must recommit to free inquiry and resist censorship pressures. Our democratic experiment cannot function without a citizenry trained to think critically and engage in healthy debate and dialogue. We must not allow our classrooms to be turned into civic battlegrounds of censorship and fear.
Today, we must resoundingly say, no more. Voting is the bare minimum. Organizing, volunteering, donating, speaking up — that’s how we make real change.
