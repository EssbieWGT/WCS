(Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest — not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)In February, my health care provider reached out with some bad news — my annual mammogram had an “area of concern,” that required me to return for additional screening.
An abnormal test result is always terrifying, but somehow Oklahoma’s health care system made the uncertainty infinitely worse. I found out it would be 54 days between receiving my results and the first available appointment at Mercy’s renown breast center in Oklahoma City. That location had the ultrasound technology necessary to provide the specialized followup needed to determine if the unexplained masses were cancerous or benign.
Thinking the scheduler had made a mistake, I called the clinic directly. The woman who answered was shocked — shocked that I had gotten in that quickly. 
Usually, she told me, it takes longer.
So the agonizing wait for answers began.
To put this timeframe into perspective: It took so long that nearly half of Oklahoma’s four-month legislative session ticked by. Seven-figure pygmy gobies – tiny fish that live among coral in the Indian Ocean –  had almost lived an entire life cycle. Red foxes had completed gestation and given birth. People had applied for and received their U.S. passports.
That delay is probably why I found myself so irked earlier this month by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s decision to veto bipartisan legislation that aimed to increase women’s access to diagnostic mammogram testing. The bill, had Stitt signed it, would have required insurance companies to foot the bill for two additional tests. In short, it would have eliminated copays and deductibles.
The proposal passed overwhelmingly through both legislative chambers and seemed like an easy win for Stitt and his fellow Republicans trying to signal that they actually care about women’s health outcomes. 
After all, breast cancer is a disease that disproportionately affects women, and ours is a state where women die from the disease at higher rates than the national average. In Oklahoma, an estimated 22.4 per every 100,000 women die compared with 19.3 nationally, according to the National Cancer Institute. In rural McCurtain County, the death rate is a staggering 36.4 women per 100,000 – almost double the national rate.
The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, which advocates for evidence-based medicine and prevention, notes that Black women are 40% more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts, and that it is critical that patients “receive equitable and appropriate follow-up.” The task force recommends women have a biennial mammogram for over three decades — from age 40 until 74.
Breast cancer is a disease where the odds of surviving are significantly improved by early detection, so it boggles the mind that Stitt would reject legislation that removes a cost-barrier that might prevent Oklahomans from getting screened.
But with the stroke of a pen, our male governor demonstrated that he doesn’t understand — or even care about — the struggles we women face to access what should be a routine health care procedure. And, he showed that he’s fine with women being forced to disproportionately bear those testing costs. Because how many men do you know who pay for biennial mammograms?
And as icing on the already unsavory cake, Stitt vetoed this legislation authored by a lawmaker fighting breast cancer, experiencing first hand the struggles that Oklahomans face. 
In 2022, legislators passed a law requiring coverage of diagnostic mammograms, but Melissa Provenzano, the bill’s author, said access to mammogram machines depends on where you live. She also said that women report their insurers are pushing back on the copay protections despite the law.
In his veto message, Stitt wrote that he was “deeply sympathetic” to women who have bravely fought the disease. He noted that he was aware that early detection and access to care are critical priorities. But, Stitt said,the legislation “imposes new and costly mandates on private health insurance plans” that will raise premiums for “working families and small businesses.”
Stitt is clearly more sympathetic to health insurers who often charge “working families and small businesses” large monthly insurance premiums and then continue to collect even more from them in copays and deductibles.
Like most businesses, insurance companies aim to make money. It often takes legislative action to force them to waive copays or deductibles, which chip away at their profits.
It remains to be seen whether lawmakers will let Stitt’s veto stand. If every lawmaker who supported it initially stayed the course, they’d have the two-thirds of votes needed to override it.
While they’re mulling it over, perhaps they should consider that ours is a state that has some of the worst health outcomes in the country. Maybe it’s time to worry less about hurting insurers’ feelings, put on their big girl pants and champion policies that will make lifesaving testing easier to access and more affordable — for Oklahomans of any gender.
Because while the masses in my breast were determined to be benign, nobody should have to wait months for those answers or be required to pay for a doctor-recommended screening that could save her life.

One of North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s first acts upon assuming office earlier this year was to name a new Secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, and from the looks of things thus far, the person to whom he turned, Dr. Dev Sangvai, was a winning selection.
Since taking office, Sangvai — a family medicine practitioner and Duke University professor – has quickly hit the ground running and emerged as forceful voice for commonsense in the often rancorous world of health care policy.
Most recently Sangvai has spoken out publicly and energetically in opposition to the massive Medicaid and SNAP food assistance cuts working their way through Congress. And as Sangvai reminded NC Newsline, his concerns about the cuts are about more than mere empathy for struggling families – they’re also based on hard data which show the devastating ripple effects the cuts will have on North Carolina’s overall health and economic wellbeing.

In January, Disability Rights Mississippi and Jackson reached a settlement agreement establishing standards that JTRAN, Jackson’s transportation system, must continue to reach for in the coming months. Otherwise, the city could face further legal action from disability advocates. 
While it may be considered progress for the city, the conclusion of the lawsuit was not publicized earlier this year as the mayor ran unsuccessfully for reelection, though he generally touted improvements in JTRAN during the campaign. Materials from Mayor Chokwe Lumumba’s campaign highlight updates to JTRAN’s bus fleet, as well as securing more than $20 million in federal funds to improve Jackson’s transit system. 
Scott Crawford, the lead plaintiff in the 2008 lawsuit, which led to a 14 year-long consent decree, said the settlement agreement is a move in the right direction. 
“The notion that the consent decree could last forever is just not realistic. You can’t tie up a court system overseeing a transit system forever. That is not practical, and I’m the lead plaintiff,” said Crawford, JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee Chairperson. “You can’t have courts overseeing a system forever, so they needed it off the docket. That’s just a pragmatic fact of life. We had it in place for 14 years, and that’s a very long time.”
Those standards include ensuring that 95% of telephone hold times are not longer than three minutes and 99% are not longer than five minutes. It also states no more than 10 trip denials in a month, which occurs when JTRAN cannot provide a trip or when JTRAN offers a trip with a pick-up or drop-off time differing by more than 60 minutes from the requested time.
In addition, the settlement agreement focuses on the timeliness of passenger pickups, with at least 90% of all pickups occurring within the on-time pickup window, which is 30 minutes, and 95% of all pickups within 45 minutes.
“To be accurate and clear, we’ve only met that standard one month, so we’re not there yet. Nobody’s declaring victory. It’s a work in progress,” Crawford said.

Minutes from April’s JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee meeting provides data that shows trip cancellations were down in January and February. Excessive ride times were up, with a few rides lasting longer than 120 minutes. The settlement agreement says that the city shall not provide excessively long trips for more than 5% of paratransit trips in a month, and no trip should be longer than 120 minutes.
“We have been in the range of 78% to 85% (for on-time dropoffs) in the last several months. I hope we can get up to 90% for Paratransit on-time performance. That would be an acceptable level of timeliness when you’re trying to get to appointments,” he said. “If you’re the medical provider or you’re the employer, you really want your folks to be on time for their appointments and their jobs, so it matters.”
The city of Jackson contracted with MV Transportation to manage transportation services, including JTRAN bus drivers, in January of 2024. Last fall, the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1208, which represents the drivers, went on strike against MV Transportation due to concerns such as long hours, wrongful terminations and safer working conditions. The strike lasted two weeks. 
Christine Welch, deputy director for the Office of Transportation, said that one thing JTRAN needs now is more bus drivers.
“It’s across the board. Drivers,” Welch said. “Currently we have about 54, 55. The desired number is hopefully about 60 drivers.”
JTRAN’s buses are ADA accessible, she said, meaning that people with disabilities can ride fixed routes or paratransit. But paratransit comes with some limitations. 
“You have to first be certified for that service based on your medical disability,” she said. “It’s a door to door service, curb to curb. Our services operate within three-fourths of a mile of a fixed route.”
Crawford said that one way to ensure JTRAN meets the standards agreed to in the settlement is for the city to hire more bus operators and pay them a fair wage. 
MV Transportation’s current job listings for CDL drivers in Jackson come with a starting pay of about $16-an-hour. The city is also seeking an associate planner who will aid JTRAN in managing paratransit services.
“I think public transit is worth its weight in gold. I think we underpay our transit staff, and that would help. That’s one way to fix this, but trying to convince lawmakers is an uphill battle,” Crawford said. “These are professionals who are doing a stressful job, and they need to be paid like it.” 
Greta Martin, litigation director for Disability Rights Mississippi, said that the protection and advocacy organization will continue to monitor data that the city of Jackson provides to them on a monthly basis. 
“For every piece of data that we get from the city of Jackson, there is some kind of number that they have to stay within,” Martin said. “It’s kind of a wraparound situation that we have. We’re making sure that we keep an eye on the data, but we’re also trying to work with the city, knowing that they have their own limitations, but then we also want to be accountable to the community and understand what their perspective is as people that utilized the services.”
Martin said by ending the consent decree and reaching a settlement agreement, it allows the city and her organization to direct time and resources toward improving public transit and quality of life for people who have disabilities. 
“That was the point of filing the litigation to begin with, to hold them accountable for the services they should be providing people with disabilities in the city,” Martin said. “I hope it fosters a collaboration with the city so that not only will they lean upon us for these issues involving public transit, but also that they will lean upon us for making the city of Jackson more accessible as a whole.”
Martin has represented plaintiffs in the JTRAN lawsuit since she started at the legal advocacy organization seven years ago. A little over a year ago, the city hired Martin’s husband, Drew Martin, as its lead attorney. The plaintiff’s lawyer said she’s received more feedback from the city attorney’s office in the last year than at any other point in the litigation. 
She quipped that may be because “my husband sees my name on the email and says, ‘I better answer it.’”
“I’ll take my wins anywhere I can find them for people with disabilities,” Greta Martin said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19205814/JTRAN-1.jpg,,,2025-05-26 10:09:29.126790

Their beauty, wildlife and opportunities for adventures are a great gift to current and future Alaskans, as well as our many visitors. From Denali to Katmai to Glacier Bay, these special places help drive a thriving tourism economy and support reliable, made-in-Alaska jobs. Unfortunately, Alaska’s national parks and the economic benefits they bring are threatened by drastic staffing and budget cuts to the National Park Service. It was recently reported that the National Park Service Alaska Regional Office in Anchorage has lost an estimated one-third of its staff — more than 60 knowledgeable Alaskans — a result of downsizing the Department of Interior through pressured buyout tactics. And the federal administration has threatened additional cuts through mass firings.
Roughly 2 million people visited Alaska national parks in 2023, and more are expected this year. They spent $1.5 billion dollars and supported 23,000 jobs, according to the National Park Service. In Anchorage alone, 1 in 9 jobs is in tourism, Visit Anchorage has found. Across the country, one tax dollar invested in the Park Service returns $10 to the economy. 
But national parks don’t run themselves. People are needed to keep parks running, from park rangers to contracting experts, from educators who design the visitor center exhibits to biologists who make sure that park wildlife survive and thrive.
The Alaska Regional Office provides oversight and expertise to 24 national park sites across Alaska, covering more than 50 million acres of federal land. The scale and landscape of Alaska makes the Alaska Regional Office essential. Most Alaska national park sites only have one or two resource staff and limited capacity.  It doesn’t make financial sense for every park to have its own pilot and plane, geologist, or subsistence expert. The Regional Office provides support and expertise that serve all our parks.
At the Alaska Regional Office, cuts and consolidation programs have eliminated crucial positions, including the regional chief ranger overseeing law enforcement. Now there is only one staff member leading archaeology and cultural resource protection for all of Alaska’s national park sites, and just a handful of staff remain to work with Alaska Native tribes, whose culture, food security, and traditional ways of life should be respected by those parks.
The people who work in the National Park Service in Alaska are Alaskans. Their jobs bring important cash into our communities, and they are our friends and neighbors. The loss of Park Service jobs and the other federal land management agency jobs will hurt our economy and jeopardize the valuable resources of the parks. Without adequate staffing, park visitors may be at risk or at least disappointed. The tourism market is extremely competitive. It may not take too many bad experiences with deteriorating roads, dirty restrooms, inadequate information, disorganized commercial operations and absent wildlife to undermine one of the pillars of Alaska’s economy.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski has pushed hard to protect federal jobs in Alaska. In contrast, Rep. Nick Begich just voted for a $250 million cut to Park Service staff funding. We need our delegation to stand up for our national parks, our economy and our communities. It is not too late to keep our amazing national parks safe, accessible, sustainable, productive and world class.

Michelle Lujan Grisham about public safety, threats to Medicaid and governing through Trump.","New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in her office on the fourth floor of the state Capitol in May, 2025 (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham still uses coffee left over from Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration, which she describes in less-than-flattering terms before offering some at the outset of this interview (we declined). She drank from a mug festooned with the New Mexico flag and noted that her staff had been mocking her all day for wearing metallic pants. Source’s extended interview, however, did not touch on fashion—of which we know zilch—but, instead, focused on the governor’s executive order deploying the National Guard to Albuquerque to help manage that city’s crime problems; threats to New Mexico’s Medicaid from the proposed budget recently approved by U.S. House Republicans; and governing during the Trump administration(s). Lujan Grisham began her second term as governor in 2023, and previously served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the state’s 1st Congressional District, and as the state’s health secretary under former Gov. Bill Richardson. The governor’s Chief of Staff Daniel Schlegel and Communications Director Michael Coleman sat in the room during this interview, which has been edited for concision and clarity.
Source NM: Your front desk just received a call from someone who wants you to recall the National Guard from Albuquerque. Are you getting mixed reviews on that?
MLG: I don’t feel like we’ve gotten mixed reviews. I do think people are confused about what it is and maybe we can do a better job explaining it. We’ve previously sent the state police into Albuquerque in a number of ways and strategies, but I’m running out of state police to cover all of that additional work in areas where we’ve got growing risk. The Guard can do all of these administrative police activities [such as] dispatch. Some of them are a little more frontward facing: driving arrestees if they need medical attention, meeting them at the hospital so they can provide security. They can do security at the shelters, where we’ve got [the Albuquerque Police Department] and the [Bernalillo County Sheriff’s] office doing court security. All of that will be managed and directed by Guardsmen and women who were trained military police already, who were retrained about how APD and how the sheriff’s office handles those efforts. And then you have more police on the ground in the areas that need them. All [people are] going to see in a neighborhood is a sheriff’s vehicle with deputies and an APD vehicle [and] APD on cycles the way you would normally see that. I don’t think people quite understand that a tank and people in uniforms like soldiers are not coming into your neighborhoods under this administration. That’s not what we have ever proposed and it’s not something I’m interested in.
Has your stance on public safety changed during your tenure as governor? The New York Times has highlighted, more than once, that your positions have put you in conflict with some other Democrats.
I think maybe because it’s become such a lightning rod favorably to Republicans. But remember, I put 50 state police into the International District primarily, but all along that central corridor, in 2019. I have consistently moved them around and, I would argue, made them a little short staffed for the [Interstate 25] corridor, and then that [Interstate 40] intersection, because there are not enough police. [According to the governor’s office, the state police currently has 100 vacancies.]
We’re an interesting state for crime in a number of ways. High poverty states usually have more difficulties. We didn’t have any behavioral health [due to the dismantling of behavioral health services during Martinez’s administration]. Drug addiction is rampant, though that’s being, I think, attenuated. We’ve got some really good outcomes there, but it’s not gone by any stretch of the imagination. And that I-25/ I-40 connection is just not good for stopping crime. It’s where it moves. All those trucking stops. It’s one of the reasons Albuquerque gets hit so hard. So, I think I’ve been very consistent. I just have not gotten enough attention. And I think you can hear it in my voice. I think what they’re seeing shift is I’m a bit more frustrated about, ‘My gosh, how many more victims do we need?’
You said at the end of the legislative session you wanted a special session to address crime, juvenile crime in particular. Is that still a possibility?
It is still a possibility. We’ve been meeting with leadership staff. There’s more movement to be in a more productive place for a special session. But we’re not where we need to be and there’s no reason to call them and not have any effort. Plus, I don’t want to do three or four or five or six special sessions, as we see what rolls out from the feds, particularly in the next couple of days [this interview took place on May 21, prior to the U.S. House May 22 passage of the GOP budget bill]. And I think there’s widespread agreement by the Democratic leadership that we should adjust our priorities and our budgets to reflect whatever we need to do and can do in the short term to protect New Mexicans.
Do you have an ideal scenario of how the state would make up Medicaid funding shortfalls?
I think that the fact that we’ve got money in reserves…there are things that we can do. My pitch to the Legislature today—and of course, I haven’t seen what’s coming, although I have a pretty good idea—is we should try to sustain to the degree that we can for a year. And it’s really two [years] between now and when [the 2026 midterm elections] would take hold in Congress, but see if you can stem the closures of rural hospitals and healthcare clinics, and that we don’t lose any movement to hold onto OBGYNs, which is precarious. That’s my perspective today. It’s still a lot of money and we’d have to game it out. It could be as little as $1 billion that we’d have to come up with in healthcare. It could be as much as $3 billion and that’s before you get to education and the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program].
Would the strategy for addressing SNAP cuts be similar to Medicaid?
Yes, because you’ve got $1 billion that we get into the state for SNAP. They’re not eradicating it. These are radical cuts. It’s a little bit different and I don’t think people quite understand the nuance of it, but we could be on the hook for up to $300 million if the cuts, as we know them, were voted on today. I don’t think that’s going to happen, and I’m going to fight hard to prevent that from happening. I think I might be doing a call shortly to encourage voters of every persuasion all across the country: These cuts will change your communities as you know them, and people will get hurt and they will die. And when we have food prices as high as they are, and with all the tariff complications, then you have your food budget goes not nearly as far. So, we’d have to figure out SNAP. I’m not as worried, believe it or not, about education, but there are education cuts. There are impacts everywhere.
We haven’t had much success getting anything more than boiler plate out of the Public Education Department as it relates to the Trump administration’s orders about diversity/equity and inclusion to avoid funding cuts.
That makes me happy. And the reason it does is: We don’t discriminate in New Mexico. We’re also a minority-majority state. We think that when they do a blanket search for inclusion or equity or equality, they forget that that’s how we define rural investments. So, we’ve just provided that boilerplate language that we think meets the federal effort at changing what they believe are reverse-discrimination rules. I work hard to not tip the scales against New Mexicans. That department and others are going to respond to the feds as they’re required to, but we have been a little vanilla about, ‘We don’t violate any of those rules right now. Thank you so much for reminding us that there’s no discrimination allowed.’
But in my mind, what the federal government is after is different, right? They want to discriminate against people who have racial differences, gender differences, sexual orientation differences, religious differences. This is a state that’s proud about its inclusion and diversity, but we don’t discriminate, and we just have been saying so. And we’re going to continue to do that and continue to provide Attorney General [Raúl Torrez] with information that we think is harmful and illegal in the way in which the feds might approach any of these issues and see where they go in the courts. All of this is being tested, as you know, in the courts, and we’re doing well in terms of preliminary injunctions. But who knows where it goes? The bigger risk isn’t with these executive orders. The bigger risk is Congress’s action right now.
Do you support AG Torrez’ approach in joining various lawsuits against the Trump administration?
California or New York, collectively, have thousands of lawyers who can just pay attention to the federal lawsuits. [Torrez] doesn’t have that luxury, so he has to be—pardon the pun—judicious, and we certainly understand that. I totally respect that he makes decisions about which places where he’s out front more. But we’re participating robustly, and I have no doubt that he is identified as one of the leaders. We are one of the states with the most to lose, given our federal footprint here, and he’s out there doing it. You’re going to see New York and California and Illinois —the bigger states—get a lot of attention. But I know that our AG is robustly engaged, and I’m glad. I need him to be and he is.
You have not been particularly outspoken or making public speeches about the Trump administration.
Because I don’t know what it does. I don’t need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately. I mean, these people at Homeland Security are terrifying. The abandonment of our constitutional rights and due process is terrifying. Now, I don’t want New Mexicans to think that I’m not tough. You know you got to be tough to roll up like a burrito and sneak into the White House. I took on Trump in a very public phone call during [COVID-19], and basically said, ‘You are not telling the truth. You never tell the truth, and I will not let you create a situation where New Mexicans aren’t protected.’ Right after that, we got on as the last tiered state for [Personal Protective Equipment] and COVID vaccines and testing supplies. Now I got that reversed, but what if I hadn’t gotten that reversed and we couldn’t get any testing kits? That’s a big problem, and so I know what the risks are.
But Trump [in his first term] was navigating. Trump [in his second term] has people who will do whatever he asks them to do. This is a whole different agenda. They’ll have to come through me to get to you, but I’m not going to invite them to drive over here and get into a boxing match, particularly when the courts are doing, I think, fairly well in terms of saying, ‘wait a minute, this doesn’t seem right. You don’t have the authority.’ I’m more worried about the cuts than anything.
But let’s talk about the stuff that we have done. We have really strong privacy laws. They’re not getting access to our data. We aren’t providing any of that legally protected information and we aren’t going to do it. They ask for it all the time. You can expect a whole lot more in the 30-day session. You’ve seen us really strengthen reproductive laws. We’ll probably do a state [Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act] EMTALA statutory protection, [in case] the feds take that away for reproductive health.










I don't need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately.

New Mexico plays an important role in the Trump administration’s immigration and deportation agenda, partly because there’s a new so-called militarized buffer zone on the state’s border. What is your take on that?
I don’t like it for the number of risks it introduces to an area that needs more security and support, not more risk. I’m also worried because now I don’t have direct access in that militarized zone either. We would do sometimes…well more than 100 humanitarian rescues in that part of the desert. New Mexico is very dangerous to cross, and they will leave you out there, those coyotes, to die. But I’m more worried about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] [and] anything that begins to interfere with due process, rights and constitutional protections. Believe it or not, I invited any of the feds in Homeland Security: ‘You want to go after bad actors through the Organized Crime Commission? I’m in. By the book. By the law. Due process.’ No, they’re not interested. What they want is for me to authorize or support them in convincing local police, including the state police, to do ICE enforcement and I’m not doing that because I think it’s unconstitutional.
The Times also had a story last month about [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer and other Democratic governors trying to cultivate some kind of relationship with the Trump administration. Is that what you’re doing?
I wouldn’t call it cultivating a relationship, but part of your job as a governor, you get what you get at the federal level. In the Biden administration, you might imagine that I had some very challenging conversations with [former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack], who kept burning down stuff here without…providing notice or following the rules. In any administration, I have very terse, aggressive stances, conversations, debates and lawsuits against the federal government. I also have great relationships with certain departments on certain issues, and I think you have to do that.
I do think, frankly, if you can get in to see the president, you can actually get him to be more reasonable. He likes you to propose a deal. I have asked to meet with the White House recently about a number of issues, not the least of which is, they owe me money for [the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant] for the roads. I need them to be serious about public safety. They rejected what we thought was an easy proposal: If you know where someone is on a felony warrant, let’s go, let’s do it together. You’re involved in a in a big fentanyl drug bust? Let’s do it together. I got sort of squarely rejected because their priority is massive deportations. And I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s not a deal I’m willing to be engaged in.
We had another big issue I was trying to navigate with them…[which was Liquified Natural Gas]. I was just in Japan and Singapore, and we’re pitching clean LNG. We reduce the world’s carbon footprint if we’re using our LNG, and they can’t produce geothermal and solar and wind in Japan and Singapore. So, they’re going to be using LNG. So, I wanted to talk to the White House about that because they’re not pushing the western states [for energy projects]. They’re pushing one state, and I’ll bet you can guess which one.
[Reporter feebly offers incorrect guess]
No, Alaska. So, I’m going to Alaska next week because: Don’t have a conversation about my energy without me at the table. I couldn’t get in to see the president. I got in to see some very nice liaisons. We’re working on economic development, on introducing the states [to] green energy [and] to a number of other countries. Some of the best methane detection companies are in Japan, so I want them locating here. You don’t need a foe who says, [the energy economy is] only in Alaska. Gretchen and other [Democratic state governors] are doing their jobs. I’m not looking to curry favor with any president. I’m looking to represent New Mexico effectively.

At a recent town Sen. Ben Ray Luján [D-N.M.] held, many attendees seemed to want a stronger response from Democrats. Some of them wanted Sen. Luján to go on the road with [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and [New York U.S. Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You’ve been in politics a long time: Are you critical of how Democrats are handling this current moment?
I don’t know that I’m critical. For me, the politics here don’t solve the fact that I have to figure out how to keep a rural hospital open. I’m going to tell you how I answered a question recently. A person said, I think, that they didn’t vote for Trump, but they’re Republican —this wasn’t in New Mexico —and they said, ‘I just can’t support this president. What do I tell my kids?’ As people were talking about it, somebody else said, ‘Well, but there’s two sides to Trump.’ And they talked about the nice sides. And I said, ‘No, there are not two sides.’
I have to do my job to get the federal government to apply its resources here…but I’m not going to stand up and support a person who openly lies, is vile and abhorrent and doesn’t seem to understand or care that he creates real risk and people are harmed. I respect the office of presidency. I respect the federal government. I respect all the branches, but I can’t accept that behavior by any person, and I won’t excuse it. So, I get that people are really pissed. I do. That’s the word. I’m really pissed about it my own self.
These tours, I hope, are aimed more at getting Democrats to realize they have real choices. But in those real choices, be careful that you don’t actually create the opposite, which is that we are electing extremists on either side of the political spectrum. Congress can’t run like that. It isn’t running like that. Congress is broken. And when Congress is broken, you have sweeping changes. You can’t govern. You need a little bit of everything. You need a body that can govern and deliver.
We have to be very clear about what we need in [the 2026 midterm elections]. We can never allow people who lie to us, who aim to hurt us and punish us, who use the office for retribution, elected into any office ever again. And we need to be open minded. Don’t let what you think is the perfect solution be the enemy of good overall.
I am going to go to some of these town halls with our delegation because I think people want to know, ‘what do you think, and what are you doing?’ And I do have an opinion, and I am doing stuff, and I think that could be helpful because people deserve elected leaders to have a conversation about where we find ourselves today.

Are you sorry you’re ending your tenure as governor in this particular federal climate?
I am sorry about that, because I don’t think the world deserves someone as reckless as the current president. You know, it’s very nice to have a president or a president-elect ask you to think about being a cabinet secretary, and to ask you to be thought about as a vice president. That’s very flattering, but I think people made assumptions that I was really interested in pushing that, and these two [gestures at Schlegel and Coleman] can tell you unequivocally: I wasn’t leaving. I like this job, and I don’t feel like I’m done. I feel like I need six more years. And I tease that I lost three with COVID-19 and fires.
But I’m also really proud: No state in the nation has our cradle to career system. We did far better economically than anyone thought we could. I’ve always believed that we could punch above our weight class. I think COVID really stalled out a lot of our educational potential progress [but] I think we’re going to get there.
What about the Children, Youth and Families Department?
CYFD is one of those really hard ones. We need to do more. We have had some missteps. There’s no question about that, but nobody wants to work there. And the more that you try to take it over, the less that’s the case. We have some ideas that didn’t get over the finish line that we can implement anyway, and we’re going to do what the Legislature told us to do in a robust and cooperative manner. I wish it was an easier road to hoe. Maybe on a happier note, at CYFD, 200 or 300 foster kids and families were at the residence on Saturday, and a lot of them have suggestions about what we need to do better, which is great, and we’re doing it. We are going to do a massive adoption effort and get lots of families all ready to go, and that’s really good news and exciting for these families and kids.
Your term doesn’t end for more than a year and a half, but do you know what you’re doing next?
I don’t quite know. I do want to work, and I think folks are expecting me to look at healthcare some more and look at energy. We really are a powerhouse, and we have the ability to do a lot more transition and green work, not just in the country, but around the world. I’m excited about that. [New Mexico is hosting the Western Governors Association in June] and we’re going to have a robust conversation. You cannot power the eastern United States without the western states.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)Our soldiers have endured unimaginable hardships and faced profound challenges, testing the very limits of human resilience and strength. When they arrive home, the trauma many veterans experience abroad comes with them, and the toll it takes on their mental health can be devastating without intervention. Veterans will face additional challenges if promises of massive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs layoffs around the country and in Idaho go forward.
Our veterans deserve better.
Several Americans have protested cuts to the VA. Here in Boise at the VA campus, local community members have supported those protests, demonstrating just how important VA services are to Idaho veterans. Our communities are concerned about access to behavioral health care for our veterans and with good cause. Military veterans are 57.3% more likely to die by suicide than non-veteran U.S. adults. This stark statistic reveals the harsh reality that our service members face, particularly those living in rural areas like many veterans do in Idaho. Our state has one of the highest rates of rural military populations, and it has a higher rate of VA reliance for health care than the national average.
The Trump administration aims to cut 83,000 jobs from Veterans Affairs. The VA is tasked with caring for our veterans who return home, it provides crucial medical and behavioral health services including telehealth services for our rural vets. At the Boise VA campus alone, we may lose 300 employees, and this is a VA that already lacks staff for the vets it serves.
Veterans and active-duty military personnel face unique challenges. Reintegrating into civilian life, Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACEs) and post-traumatic stress all can contribute to poor mental health outcomes for our nation’s heroes.
Many veterans shy away from seeking help due to stigma, barriers to care created by the isolation of rural living, or a lack of access to services, but the need is real. Veterans in rural areas often feel most comfortable accessing these services through the VA, a community that knows what they have gone through, specifically telehealth options which can allow access to behavioral health professionals working from home.
Current changes by the administration have put into question these services, leaving our veterans uncertain about where they might find care in the future.
In Idaho, one of the most pressing issues connected with this uncertainty is the disproportionate suicide rates among service members. Research consistently shows that veterans, especially those living in remote, rural regions — a common way of life in Idaho — are at greater risk of suicide. A lack of accessible mental health services can prevent veterans in need from receiving vital care.
Furthermore, for patients at risk of suicide continuity of care, including consistent follow-ups with trusted health care providers is critical. Any threat to losing that continuity of care poses a significant danger, it is well known to be a key component of successful strategies to prevent suicide.
Veterans health care provided by the VA removes barriers to care associated with insurance accessibility and affordability, and in many cases has been offered with telehealth options. However, any health services required outside of the VA falls on the service members to cover. If the VA’s behavioral health services are disrupted in a way that jeopardizes telehealth for rural veterans, it not only creates a crisis in continuity of care but also establishes a significant barrier to access for many low-income veterans.


For more information on the Idaho Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, go to www.idahoafcc.org.


For veterans who are unable to access mental health services through the VA, safety net options such as the Idaho free and charitable clinics are crucial. These clinics are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for continued care and support for our nation’s heroes.
In the meantime, they can provide health care to any Idahoan without health insurance including our former service members. To ensure the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes, we must advocate for health care and behavioral health care as a basic human need, and work to improve and protect access to these services.
Veterans and service members deserve the support and care necessary to thrive, both during and after their service.

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

According to Statistics Canada, Canadian car trips into the United States this March are down almost 32% compared to March of last year. Things don’t look better for the summer either. According to a New York Times analysis, summer plane ticket sales from Canada to the U.S. are down 21%.
If this winter’s dip in Canadian snowbirds flying to Florida (and selling their Florida properties) is any indication, the Jersey Shore, particularly Cape May County, could see a similar drop. 
But in all the “will they or won’t they” coverage I’ve seen about the issue this year, I noticed one thing left out: why Canadians — in particular French Canadians — came here in the first place. Like the drive from Quebec to Wildwood, it’s a long and sometimes winding journey. 
A Canadian solution to an American problem
In the 1950s and 1960s, South Jersey Shore towns were in trouble.
Where they were once the only place people could go to escape stifling summer heat, the advent of air conditioning and swimming pools meant that relief could be found close to home instead — no long train or car ride required. 
Atlantic City turned to gambling. Cape May County? French Canadians. In 1970, Quebec legislated a two-week holiday for all construction workers for the end of July, a move that rippled out beyond the industry, with many residents of the province also taking that block of time off for summer vacation. Les Quebecois were also, theoretically, one day’s drive away, so starting in 1968, the county pitched them on better beaches, warmer water, and cheap accommodations in motels and rooming houses in Wildwood and in campgrounds that lined Route 9 just inland of beach towns like Sea Isle, Avalon, Stone Harbor, and the Wildwoods. 
In 1970, Cape May County opened a tourism office in downtown Montreal to further bind the regions. In 1973, a tourism official told The New York Times that they spent 75% of its promotional budget to attract Canadians. 
By the mid-1970s, the Canadians had taken over. Motels in the Wildwoods gave themselves names like Canadian and Quebec Motel, and venues booked Canadian stars like singer, radio, and television host Michel Louvain and Lousie-Marie Houde, a.k.a. Mademoiselle Quebec. In 1977, Atlantic City hosted Quebec Day to thank their Canadian visitors, with a flag raising, cocktail party, concert, and fashion show featuring Quebec-based artists. 
“Two weeks after the Fourth of July, cars were backed out all the way to Route 9 to see if we had campsites,” said Lenny Catanoso, 74, who until last year owned Avalon Campground in Cape May Court House with his sister Marlene. Their parents opened the business in 1967, and they were teenagers working there when the influx of Canadians started coming in. 
For part of July, “every car in town was Canadian. I haven’t seen anything like it,” said Larry Lillo, 77, Wildwood Historical Society secretary and owner of the Holly Beach Train Depot.
Lillo has also held a gamut of jobs during his lifetime in Wildwood, including ice cream salesman, lifeguard, and firefighter.
“It wasn’t just the mother and father and the kids. It was the grandmother, aunts, and uncles. The whole gang would come down and stay in apartment houses here,” he said.
I saw it too, as a kid who spent all of her summers in the 1980s and 1990s in Avalon Campground. While my family’s summer place is now in Avalon proper, we were there then for the same reasons as the Canadians: It was more affordable than on-island accommodations and offered more things to do for large family groups that might include parents and kids but also grandparents, cousins, and that guy who isn’t really your uncle but that’s what you call him. 
For the last two weeks of July and the first two weeks of August, 75% of the campground’s bookings were French Canadians, according to Lenny Cataonoso. You could see it — and hear it. The U.S., New Jersey, and Canadian flags all flew at the campground pools (where, yes, you could usually tell who was Canadian by their penchant for Speedo bathing suits). When it came time for me to pick a language to study in middle and then high school, I picked French, not because I had young girl dreams of Paris, but because I thought it would help me get a summer job down the shore when I was old enough to do so.
Currency, COVID, and conflict take a toll
I never got the chance. By the time I was old enough to work, the Canadian dollar plummeted in value, and the parade of Quebec license plates coming down the shore just about stopped. Marlene Catanoso, 72, remembers her father working the phones, offering regular Canadian visitors half-price tent spots. The Cape May County Montreal office closed in 1995. 
The relationship hasn’t entirely died out, though. Gen X and Millenial Canadians come back so their kids can have the same kind of magical Jersey Shore experience they had when they were younger. Cape May County still has a French language website and Facebook and Instagram accounts, and the county tourism department has a public relations consultant focusing on Quebec and the Toronto region of Ottawa. Before the pandemic, about 8% of Cape May County visitors were from Quebec. 
Marlene Catanoso said that older Canadian visitors stopped coming to their campground during the first Trump term, but COVID had a much bigger impact.
“For two years, we had a campground that was half empty,” she said.
It wasn’t just that the Canadian border was closed, but accommodations in the area shifted to attract locals who didn’t want to travel either. To cope, Avalon Campground converted sites that once had bare-bones amenities with tent campers in mind and upgraded them with sewer, water, and better power, in order to accommodate RVs, campers, and mobile homes — and charging for it.
Diane Weiland of Cape May County’s tourism department insisted that other factors, like the value of the Canadian dollar and a stagnant Canadian economy, are playing a bigger role in keeping the Canadians up north this summer than political discontent (though she did note that the Canadian Automobile Association has declined to run their ads; and Canadian news outlets won’t be covering U.S. destinations this year). But she believes the region will be OK, as local business owners have said that American travelers have been picking up Canadian cancellations. 
So, as the unofficial opening of the summer begins, and more restaurants, bakeries, bike shops, and arcades open for the season, we don’t know what will happen. But it’s hard to see how this more than half-century relationship can repaired, at least during this administration, when the president insists that Canada is going to be the 51st state, pushes punitive tariffs on Canadian goods at who knows what whim, and eggs on the imprisonment of foreign travelers for things like a visa mix up, translation mistake or having tattoo equipment. If I were Canadian, I wouldn’t come here. Heck, I’m an American with a beach house and don’t know if I want to be here this summer. I guess we’ll see, eh?

Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

(Stock photo by Peter Unger/Getty Images)Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.
Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see  veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our Congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our Senators and Congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

A bus boycott began in Tallahassee, Florida, after Florida A&M students Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson refused to give up their seats to white passengers. Police charged them with “placing themselves in a position to incite a riot.” 
After their arrest, the student body president, Broadus Harley, called for a meeting of the 2,300 students. They voted to boycott the buses, leading to two temporary shutdowns of the bus company. The police arrested 26 people in the protests. 
The Rev. C.K. Steele helped form the Inter-Civic Council, which created a car pool system for African Americans that city leaders attacked as an “illegal” business, leading to the arrest of Steele and others. He shot back to their opponents, “I would rather walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.” 
Council leaders were arrested and charged with operating an “illegal car pool.” Steele, Jakes and Patterson had crosses burned outside their homes. On Jan. 3, 1957, a federal judge ruled bus segregation laws unconstitutional. Four days later, Tallahassee’s city commission repealed its segregation clause.

In April 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the nation’s first religious charter school could open in Oklahoma. The St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have been funded by taxpayer money but run by a local archdiocese and diocese. Several justices appeared open to the idea during questioning, leading some analysts to predict a win for the school.
They were proved wrong on May 22, 2025, when the court blocked St. Isidore. The one-sentence, unsigned order did not indicate how individual justices had voted, nor why, simply declaring it was a split 4-4 decision that leaves in place the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling against the school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case. Her former employer, the University of Notre Dame, runs a law clinic representing the school’s supporters.
Ever since the proposed school started making headlines, attention has focused on religion. Critics warned a decision in the school’s favor could allow government dollars to directly fund faith-based charter schools nationwide. In part, the justices had to decide whether the First Amendment’s prohibition on government establishing religion applies to charter schools.
But the answer to that question is part of an even bigger issue: Are charters really public in the first place?
The Supreme Court’s order applies only to Oklahoma, so similar cases attempting to open religious charter schools may emerge down the road. As two professors who study education law, we believe future court decisions could impact more than issues of religion and state, determining what basic rights students and teachers do or don’t have at charter schools.
 Dueling arguments

In June 2023, the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore’s application to open as an online K-12 school. The following year, however, the Oklahoma high court ruled that the proposal was unconstitutional. The justices concluded that charter schools are public under state law, and that the First Amendment’s establishment clause forbids public schools from being religious. The court also found that a religious charter school would violate Oklahoma’s constitution, which specifically forbids public money from benefiting religious organizations.
On appeal, the charter school claimed that charter schools are private, and so the U.S. Constitution’s establishment clause does not apply.
Moreover, St. Isidore argued that if charter schools are private, the state’s prohibition on religious charters violates the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, which bars the government from limiting “the free exercise” of religion. Previous Supreme Court cases have found that states cannot prevent private religious entities from participating in generally available government programs solely because they are religious.
In other words, while St. Isidore’s critics argued that opening a religious charter school would violate the First Amendment, its supporters claimed the exact opposite: that forbidding religious charter schools would violate the First Amendment.
 Are charters public?

The question of whether an institution is public or private turns on a legal concept known as the “state action doctrine.” This principle provides that the government must follow the Constitution, while private entities do not have to. For example, unlike students in public schools, students in private schools do not have the constitutional right to due process for suspensions and expulsions – procedures to ensure fairness before taking disciplinary action.
Charter schools have some characteristics of both public and private institutions. Like traditional public schools, they are government-funded, free and open to all students. However, like private schools, they are free from many laws that apply to public schools, and they are independently run.
Because of charters’ hybrid nature, courts have had a hard time determining whether they should be considered public for legal purposes. Many charter schools are overseen by private corporations with privately appointed boards, and it is unclear whether these private entities are state actors. Two federal circuit courts have reached different conclusions.
In Caviness v. Horizon Learning Center, a case from 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that an Arizona charter school corporation was not a state actor for employment purposes. Therefore, the board did not have to provide a teacher due process before firing him. The court reasoned that the corporation was a private actor that contracted with the state to provide educational services.
In contrast, the 4th Circuit ruled in 2022 that a North Carolina charter school board was a state actor under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, Peltier v. Charter Day School, students challenged the dress code requirement that female students wear skirts because they were considered “fragile vessels.”
The court first reasoned that the board was a state actor because North Carolina had delegated its constitutional duty to provide education. The court observed that the charter school’s dress code was an inappropriate sex-based classification, and that school officials engaged in harmful gender stereotyping, violating the equal protection clause.
If the Supreme Court had sided with St. Isidore – as many analysts thought was likely – then all private charter corporations might have been considered nonstate actors for the purposes of religion.
But the stakes are even greater than that. State action involves more than just religion. Indeed, teachers and students in private schools do not have the constitutional rights related to free speech, search and seizure, due process and equal protection. In other words, if charter schools are not considered “state actors,” charter students and teachers may eventually shed constitutional rights “at the schoolhouse gate.”
 Amtrak: An alternate route?

When courts have held that charter schools are not public in state law, some legislatures have made changes to categorize them as public. For example, California passed a law to clarify that charter school students have the same due process rights as traditional public school students after a court ruled otherwise.
Likewise, we believe states looking to clear up charter schools’ ambiguous state actor status under the Constitution can amend their laws. As we explain in a recent legal article, a 1995 Supreme Court case involving Amtrak illustrates how this can be done.
Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation arose when Amtrak rejected a billboard ad for being political. The advertiser sued, arguing that the corporation had violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Since private organizations are not required to protect free speech rights, the case hinged on whether Amtrak qualified as a government agency.
The court ruled in the plaintiff’s favor, reasoning that Amtrak was a government actor because it was created by special law, served important governmental objectives and its board members were appointed by the government.
Courts have applied this ruling in other instances. For example, the 10th Circuit ruled in 2016 that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was a governmental agency and therefore was required to abide by the Fourth Amendment’s protection from unreasonable search and seizure.
Since the Supreme Court did not release any reasoning for its order, we do not know how the justices viewed the “government actor” question in the case from Oklahoma. That said, we believe charter schools fail the test set out in the Amtrak decision. Charter schools do serve the governmental purpose of providing educational choice for students. However, charter school corporations are not created by special law. They also fall short because most have independent boards instead of members who are appointed and removed by government officials.
However, we would argue that states can amend their laws to comply with Lebron’s standard, ensuring that charter schools are public or state actors for constitutional purposes.

Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.
Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our Congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our Senators and Congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

Most people will not need to apply.","The Summer EBT program provides an extra infusion of funds for food over the summer when children are out of school and do not have access to reduced price or free breakfast and lunch. This is the second year the program, federally known as SUN Bucks, is offered to eligible families.
Connecticut is one of 38 states, along with several tribal nations and U.S. territories, participating in SUN Bucks this year. Through the program, families receive a one-time benefit of $120 per child to spend on food. Around 300,000 children in Connecticut are expected to be served by the initiative this year.
Do I need to enroll? 
According to Daniel Giacomi, the director of program oversight and grant administration at the Department of Social Services (DSS), most families will not have to apply but rather will be automatically enrolled in the program. That includes children between 5 and 18 years old who receive SNAP benefits or Temporary Family Assistance, are on HUSKY A with an income at or below 185% of the federal poverty line, and children who have applied for the national school lunch program at their school and were determined eligible for the 2024-25 school year. In all, DSS says that 97% of recipients will be automatically enrolled.
If your child does not fall into one of those categories but your household income is less than 185% of the federal poverty line, you can apply for the program by visiting this link, starting in June. DSS says enrollment is not yet available because they are still making enhancements to the application.
When will benefits begin? 
Benefits will be added to EBT cards at the end of June or the beginning of July, but a precise date has not yet been confirmed, according to DSS. While last year the benefits were delayed after Connecticut agencies failed to effectively coordinate the launch of the program, Giacomi said that he did not anticipate a similar snafu this summer.
“We took the lessons learned from last year, and the hiccups that came along with it, to minimize the repeating of the same issue, so at this time, we don’t foresee any issues in being able to distribute the benefits on time,” he said.
What can the money be used for? 
Similar to the SNAP program, the money can only be used to buy food and can’t be used on prepared food. It can’t be used at restaurants, but it can be used for food from the grocery store or farmer’s market, and to buy plants that are used to grow food.
There are also a number of farmer’s markets throughout the state that offer SNAP doubling, so that $20 worth of produce can be purchased for 10 SNAP dollars, for example. 
Why is the program needed? 
During the summer months, children who rely on reduced price or free meals at school suddenly lose that source of food. The Summer EBT program was created by Congress in 2022 and is operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bridge that gap.
“We know that kids are home. We know obviously kids are hungry. Having two children myself, they eat more than I could possibly have ever imagined that small children would eat,” Giacomi said. “So having any amount, you know, having any funding to be able to lessen the burden upon their families is worthwhile and is something that we’ll do everything in our power to be able to continue and to operate as efficiently as possible.”
Will federal cuts impact the program? 
While Congress is currently debating a tax bill that could cut SNAP benefits by about 30%, Giacomi said it’s still unclear whether the Summer EBT program will be impacted.
“We’re taking this year as it comes. We’ve received approval to operate the program, so that’s how we’re proceeding,” he said. “But obviously we’re in communications with our federal partners, both at the USDA as well as our congressional delegation, to determine whether there would be any operational challenges in future years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0709_THM_EBTsalesign-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. But this year, a gray cloud hangs over the occasion.
Since Jan. 20, we’ve witnessed a clear and coordinated effort to erase the contributions of many service members who died defending the very freedoms we hold dear, an attempt to ease the discomfort that comes with confronting hard truths about our nation’s history. The reality is simple: Americans of all backgrounds have long played a significant role in securing the liberties that define this country.

During my 22 years of active federal service, I proudly served six combat tours, from Kosovo to Iraq to Afghanistan. I carry the weight of every deployment.
In Iraq, 2003, as a noncommissioned officer, I witnessed a young African American father killed in action. He never got to see his daughter take her first steps, graduate or walk down the aisle. That same sorrow followed me to Afghanistan in 2016, as a senior enlisted advisor in Kabul, conducting a ramp ceremony for a Caucasian American 18-year-old recent high school graduate killed in action. He had his whole life ahead of him, but laid it down so that young women and children in Afghanistan might have a better life.
Like so many before me, service members have sacrificed, endured and stood firm in defense of the values America claims to uphold. Throughout history, African American veterans have fought with honor, on foreign battlefields and here at home. Many gave their lives in service, generation after generation, and now their contributions are starting to be ignored, sacrifices buried under systemic neglect, literally being erased from military records, including  at Arlington National Cemetery and at service academies.

This country was built on the ideals of liberty, equality and the pursuit of happiness, principles that have too often been denied to many veterans. For generations, service men and women have laid down their lives for this country, in the hope that their children might one day inherit the full promise of the American Dream.

As Memorial Day becomes more associated with the start of summer than with solemn remembrance, I urge you to pause. Reflect on the lives lost to make our freedom possible, especially those who never returned home, whose families were left to grieve in a country that too often denied them the very rights their loved ones died to protect.
It is deeply disappointing to see individuals in positions of influence and power show such disregard for the lives lost in defense of this nation. When Memorial Day is politicized or dismissed, it dishonors every man and woman who gave all.
This holiday is more than symbolic. It is a sacred testament to sacrifice, service and the enduring legacy of groups like the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped change the course of World War II, even as they faced discrimination at home.
Amid both domestic turmoil and international uncertainty, understand this: the unrelenting sacrifice of any veteran, including African American veterans, helped build the superpower that America is today. There is no freedom, no liberty, no pursuit of happiness without those who came before us and gave everything they had.
Let us remember them, not just with words, but with the dignity and recognition they earned.

It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov. Phil Scott.","This commentary is by Alis Headlam of Rutland.Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont proclaimed the second week in May as Inclusion Week for the fifth year in a row. Although the week has already gone by, his message should resonate with every Vermonter. His post on Facebook reminded us that “All of us are part of the story of America, those seeking liberty and fundamental freedoms of speech, religions and equal rights that no other country can provide.” We are all a part of the human family that contributes not only to our small state and to the country, but to the world. According to comments made on Facebook after his speech was posted it is clear that some people do not clearly understand or accept the premise that inclusion is important. It will take time to help everyone understand that the concept is not a threat to any individual, but rather a way of looking forward towards justice and fairness for all. It is important that we recognize the fact that although we accept and welcome each other, there are differences that must be met with certain parameters. Inclusion does not imply equality in all aspects of our lives but rather equity. We don’t all need the same medicine if we are not ill. We don’t all need the exact same education if we are going to perform the various tasks needed to keep our communities thriving. The similarity is that we all have the same basic needs. We all need to nourish ourselves both body and mind. We need to live in safety that includes shelter and sufficient nourishment for our bodies. It means that with equity we seek to meet the needs of everyone, but also understand that we have different needs depending on our circumstances.Some of us will be teachers. Others will be plumbers or electricians. Some people provide services while others will act as administrators. No matter what road we take in life we all make a difference. Gov. Scott said, “Vermont must continue to be a welcoming place for all people by protecting civil rights, opposing hate, discrimination and bigotry whenever and wherever it shows up to improve the lives of all Vermonters.”Justice for all of us means that we have certain laws to obey. Laws that are passed by our legislators both at the national and state levels of government, not by an executive branch. In our system of checks and balances the Legislature proposes the laws and passes them, and then they are certified by our executive branch — or should that not happen, the Legislature can override the executive branch.The executive branch can issue proclamations and executive orders which are not laws. There is no legal way to enforce these wishes. But our leaders give us guidance that we can all abide by if we choose. So when Gov. Scott issued a proclamation for inclusion it is not a law that we must abide by. Rather it is a strong statement of what should guide our lives.Asked what the plan is to execute this proclamation, the answer is obvious. It is up to each of us to follow his advice as best we can. He says, “I hope you’ll take time to get to know your neighbors, learn about a culture or a tradition that is not your own.” It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity. We don’t have to agree on everything. We don’t even have to like each other, but we should try to understand each other so that we can live peaceably.It is only by making this a priority in our lives that we will find the way to live with all of our neighbors in a peaceful existence. World peace is possible, but it will take the entire human family to make it happen. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O. Schaub: Why we turned our hayfield into an art protest.","This commentary is by Eve O. Schaub of Pawlet. She and her husband Stephen create artworks under the name EveNSteve. Their Hayfield Art Gallery is free and open to the public every day, dawn to dusk.My husband and I are artists, and for the last five years we’ve been putting up a free outdoor art exhibit in the hayfield across the street from our house in Pawlet, as a way to express gratitude to our community.This spring, like other years, we were formulating a plan for a new show, but as the news of 2025 kept rolling in, we felt an urgency to address the rapidly shifting landscape in the world of the arts. We wanted to create a space to pose and contemplate what is happening.Consequently, this year, instead of a mixed media display of photographs with hand painted text, we have a 32-foot artwork in the hayfield that simply reads “WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEFUND THE ARTS?” The other four scaffoldings that normally exhibit artworks are all painted black.READ MORE
The arts help us make sense of the world. In fact, during the pandemic, this is why we felt so strongly — as art venues and public spaces were closing, and shows and events were all being cancelled one after another — that we needed to find alternative venues for people to experience art. This is how the Hayfield Art Gallery was born.At first, we literally had no idea what we were doing. Would the artwork last? Would the frameworks hold up over time? Would people just hate it? What if, after investing all the time and expense, we ourselves deemed it a failure, which of course happens in art all the time?We built one artwork, a black and white photograph of a woman in an orchard, 12 feet long and painted into it words prompted by our Covid-19 experience: “My heart is very big. Sometimes I wonder if it is big enough.”Thankfully not only did we like it, but our neighbors did too. Horns honked and hands waved as cars drove down our road. People learned about our project and came from far and wide to see it, some getting out of their cars and walking the field. During a very dark time, we had found a way to create some light.We kept going, adding additional scaffoldings, becoming more ambitious. We had a conversation with our town zoning administrator to explain why this free outdoor art display did not violate Vermont’s billboard ban. The town ultimately agreed with our argument and the artworks remained, ultimately becoming a revolving annual exhibition open to all.The days of the pandemic are now, thankfully, behind us. During that time, we all found reason to turn to the creative arts to help make sense of the world, to find hope, distraction, solace. Movies, songs, podcasts, books, poetry, art of all kinds took on a renewed significance.The recent efforts to defund the arts represent a different kind of dark time. The current administration is proposing to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. Drastic NEA cuts have already affected Vermont institutions as varied as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, the Flynn Theater and the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont.It’s important to note that the NEA is one of the largest arts funders in the U.S., yet it is also one of the smallest federal agencies. It does a tremendous amount of good with very little.Last year each taxpayer paid less than one dollar to support the NEA, and its entire budget represented about 0.003% of the federal budget. The NEA brings concerts, readings, performances and arts education to the entire country, including underserved, impoverished and rural communities, all for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.Our show for 2025 sincerely asks the question: What happens when we defund the arts? But it also asks it rhetorically, because the surrounding blank canvases represent one answer: when you defund the arts you are left with darkness.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O.

Martin Library, Northeast Minnesota Historical Collections) When I was young my grandfather told me that he emigrated from Austria-Hungary as a teenager in 1907 to avoid being drafted into the army of the Habsburg Empire. Like many Europeans, he was trying to avoid the big war that seemed to be coming. As it turned out, migrating to Chicago was not enough. In 1917, the United States declared war on Germany and conscripted men to fight in Europe, requiring all men 21 to 30 to register. My grandfather showed up on June 5, 1917, the national registration day.
According to family lore, he would have done anything, even broken his arm, to avoid being drafted. Fortunately, his draft board exempted him because he was married and had a 4-year-old son. Unfortunately, his wife died in November 1918, a victim of the influenza pandemic that spread across the country largely through the army’s huge training camps. My grandfather’s experience was my first glimpse of the wrenching impact of World War I on individual Americans.
People “make their own history,” Karl Marx observed, “but they do not make it just as they please.” We are born into a specific set of geographic, social, cultural and economic circumstances that open opportunities, at least for some, but also puts limits on individual lives — limits that for many are stark and brutal. The impact of world-changing events on individuals comes into sharp focus during times of massive social upheaval, like periods of invasion or total mobilization for war. Leo Tolstoy famously demonstrated this in “War and Peace.” Once Napoleon decided to invade Russia with a huge army, the lives of every Russian in his path would never be the same. A century later, Vasily Grossman, another great Russian writer, wrote two massive novels showing how Hitler’s army, even larger than Napoleon’s army, trampled on the personal life of every Soviet citizen, particularly those of Jewish ancestry.
The impact of World War I on Europeans needs no introduction. The armies of the belligerent states suffered more than 30 million casualties, of which about 10 million were fatalities from combat or disease. The wounded were often permanently disabled or horribly disfigured. Millions of civilians also perished, often the victims of war crimes. Postwar Europe was a continent of mourners, especially the 3 million war widows.  Personal lives were thrown up for grabs by the collapse of the Russian, German, Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Even victorious countries like Britain and France limped into the 1920s in debt and clinging precariously to their empires. The stage was set for fascism, which also came to have a profound impact on individual lives.
Americans also experienced serious disruptions in daily life during World War I, even though our country entered the war late and suffered only a small fraction of the casualties sustained by Europeans. Citizens faced a massive propaganda campaign to build support for the war, as well as food rationing, aggressive Liberty Bond drives, government-sanctioned vigilantism, prosecutions under the Espionage Act for dissenting speech, and of course, the drafting of young men, many of whom had recently arrived from Europe to escape conscription. There was no avoiding the war even half a world away from the Western Front.
When the conflagration broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were living through a wrenching transition to a new, centralized form of industrial capitalism, dominated by corporations rather than entrepreneurs, where “trusts” held near monopolistic power in banking, mining, steel and transport. Industrialization stimulated relocation, immigrants continued arriving from Europe, and Black Americans began the Great Migration to northern cities. Economic inequality reached astounding levels, with men like Carnegie and Rockefeller rich beyond belief while millions lived at subsistence levels.
As passionately divided as Americans were about the war, it was hardly the only source of tension. The United States entered World War I during a contentious period when farmer and worker militancy challenged entrenched economic power, the elected mayors in several cities (including Minneapolis) were Socialist Party members, Black Americans struggled against Jim Crow and white nationalist terrorism, women were in their final surge toward suffrage, and millions campaigned for “prohibition” in the belief that alcohol was a fundamental source of the country’s problems. As David Kennedy wrote in his indispensable book on the American home front, “Americans went to war in 1917 not only against Germans in the fields of France but against each other at home.” What happened on the home front, he continued, “was a deadly serious contest to determine the consequences of the crisis for the character of American economic, social and political life.”
Over a century later many find it hard to believe that relatively peaceful and well-mannered Minnesota was an explosive hotspot in this “war at home.” Exploring Minnesota’s history from the beginning of the European war in August 1914 through the 1920 election provides a unique vantage point from which to assess the impact of World War I on American society. Those years in Minnesota were marked by bitter political polarization, ethnic intolerance, a flagrant disregard for democratic norms and the rule of law by business leaders, and intense conflicts sometimes punctuated by violence.
This was partly the result of timing. The controversial declaration of war on Germany coincided with an intense period of battles between Minnesota’s grain milling industry, mining conglomerate, big banks, and railroads on the one hand — and the organizations representing farmers and workers on the other. The success of the Nonpartisan League in organizing farmers and the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World among miners and loggers sent shock waves through the state’s business elite. As a result, ongoing economic, social, and political conflicts merged with new ones generated by the war and the draft.
 Soon, editors of German-language newspapers were investigated as possible spies, farmers arguing for market equity were attacked as “disloyal,” and workers trying to get union contracts were branded as “Bolsheviks.”
As war was declared, the Legislature created the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety  and gave it nearly unlimited power until the armistice. The commission consisted of Gov. Joseph Burnquist, the attorney general, and five men appointed by the governor, mostly conservative businessmen. John McGee became the dominant personality in this powerful body, and until the war ended, the most powerful man in Minnesota. McGee was the oldest son of Irish immigrant farmers, and he became a successful Minneapolis lawyer representing banks and railroads. He set a tone of uncompromising nationalism and maintained that anything less than 100% support for the war effort was treasonous. McGee focused on building the Home Guard, an armed force available to enforce “loyalty,” curb the growing political power of angry farmers, and block trade unions trying to break through employers’ resistance to collective bargaining.
For McGee, the most dangerously disloyal man in the state was Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., the Little Falls lawyer who in 1914 was elected to his fifth consecutive term in the United States Congress. Lindbergh, the only son of Swedish immigrant farmers, had emerged as a leader of the Minnesota Republican Party’s progressive wing. While in Congress, he fought a determined battle to limit the power of Wall Street bankers. Lindbergh’s radical populism put him in the same camp as Robert La Follette, known as “Fighting Bob,” the fiery senator from Wisconsin. Having left Congress, Lindbergh accepted the nomination of the Nonpartisan League to run against Joseph Burnquist in the 1918 Republican primary for governor. Their electoral battle was the climax of the war for the Minnesota home front, and the most violent campaign in Minnesota history. Lindbergh is one of the most important figures in Minnesota political history but largely forgotten, eclipsed by the fame of his aviator son who bears his name.
* * *
Although Minnesota’s home front experience was the product of a particular confluence of events and personalities, the issues it raises have not been left safely in the past. 
Studying this history can alert us to how extreme economic inequality can warp democracy, how patriotism can be used to suppress fundamental rights, how politicians can harness racism and anti-immigrant nationalism to further their agendas, and how the wealthy sometimes resort to authoritarianism when their power is threatened.  Hopefully exploring these years of sharp polarization can help us navigate our own perilous times.

I was flying a mission in a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter over northern Kuwait near the Iraq border when I learned that terrorists had attacked our homeland. 
I remember the flood of emotions that hit me — shock, sorrow, anger, and an overwhelming sense of resolve. In that moment, the mission became personal. The idea of service, which had always been central to my life, was no longer just about duty — it became about defending the people I loved, the nation I swore to protect, and the ideals that define us as Americans.
As a soldier and an American, I am humbled by the memory of those we honor on Memorial Day. From the beaches of Normandy to the jungles of Vietnam, from the fields of Gettysburg to the deserts of Iraq, generations of selfless men and women have laid down their lives so that we may enjoy the blessings of freedom, security, and peace.
Every headstone at Arlington National Cemetery, every name etched on a memorial wall, tells the unique sacrifice of a Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine who gave everything in the service of something greater than themselves, and we will never forget them.
The origins of Memorial Day trace back to the Civil War, a conflict so brutal it claimed more American lives than any war in our history. After the devastation brought about by that war, America committed to the idea of remembering and honoring our fallen. That brought about many of today’s memorials, including the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in downtown Indianapolis. Over the nearly 250 years of our nation, what remains constant is the character of those who wear the uniform: courage, sacrifice, and a love of country that transcends self-interest. 
Whenever I am in Washington D.C., I find time to stop by the Lincoln Memorial and take a moment to reflect by reading the Gettysburg Address etched in the memorial wall. I always walk away humbled and with a renewed sense of purpose because of the words President Lincoln spoke that day.
“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”
As we approach this long weekend and the unofficial start of summer, let us remember the true meaning of Memorial Day — to honor the cost of freedom and remember those who paid it for us. This weekend is for the people who never made it home, whose lives were cut short in the pursuit of liberty.
To my fellow service members, past and present, I say thank you. To the Gold Star families, know that your loved ones will never be forgotten — their sacrifice lives on in the heart of this nation. And to all Americans: may we honor the fallen not just today, but every day, through our commitment to the values they fought and died to protect.
Honoring their names means more than offering gratitude. It means carrying forward the ideals they believed in — freedom, justice, and unity — and understanding that the fight to preserve them is never over.

(Provided/Robert Smalls Monument Commission)When Rob Edwards started telling people he was writing a comic book about South Carolina Civil War hero Robert Smalls, he’d have to accompany it with an explanation of Smalls’ life.
Now, when he mentions his graphic novel, many people already know Smalls’ story, he said.
“It’s really fantastic to see,” said Edwards, a writer and producer who lives in Los Angeles. “And no one is more deserving than Capt. Smalls himself.”
Edwards’ upcoming graphic novel “DEFIANT,” which he hopes to turn into a feature-length film, is part of a broader effort to educate the public about a story that had been largely forgotten, including Smalls’ escape from slavery on a commandeered Confederate ship and his time as a state legislator and five-term congressman.
South Carolina legislators are planning to commemorate Smalls’ life with a statue across from the Statehouse visitors’ entrance, the first on the grounds recognizing an individual Black person.
A joint committee of senators and representatives approved plans for the statue May 8, on the last day of the 2025 session. The vote by the State House Committee affirmed the design and location chosen by the commission created by a bill the Legislature approved unanimously last year.

“He’s probably one of the greatest South Carolinians of all time, as is well documented,” former Sen. Gerald Malloy, who is in charge of fundraising to build the statue, said during a recent trip to scout out the Statehouse grounds with the statue’s artist.
Edwards, who has written movies for titans such as Disney and Marvel, didn’t know Smalls’ story either when a friend first brought him the idea.
The friend had seen a post on X, formerly Twitter, asking why of all the movies being made none had featured the action-packed story of Smalls’ escape on the U.S.S. Planter in Charleston and ensuing life in politics.
That intrigued Edwards, who started researching Smalls’ life.
He got in touch with Michael B. Moore, Smalls’ great-great-grandson, as well as a Harvard historian who studied Smalls, trying to learn as much as possible.
It was crucial to get the details of Smalls’ incredible feats correct, Edwards said.
“Because it’s true and because it’s phenomenal, (the story) has to reflect reality or else somebody’s going to say, ‘Oh, come on, that didn’t happen,’” Edwards said.
The part of Smalls’ story people tend to know is what Edwards calls “the heist:” Under cover of night, Smalls stole the Confederate ship he piloted and, using Confederate disguises and hand signals, delivered himself, his family and other enslaved workers to freedom in Union waters.
Exciting as that story is, Edwards was drawn to Smalls’ life as a free man. He became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy, used his prize money for capturing the steamship he hijacked to buy the same mansion where he had been enslaved, and became a renowned politician.
During Reconstruction, Smalls was part of the majority-Black convention of delegates who wrote the state’s 1868 constitution, which promised free education to all children and voting rights to all men. He served in the state House and Senate before winning a seat in Congress in 1874.
In 1895, Smalls was again a delegate for a convention — this time majority white — to rewrite the state constitution. He pleaded for a constitution guaranteeing “free and honest” elections while recognizing the convention was meant to disenfranchise Black voters.
“That was the stuff that was really amazing to me,” Edwards said.
Edwards, whose writing credits include Disney’s “The Princess and the Frog” and Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World,” wanted to turn the story into a movie, but he knew selling the script might prove difficult.
He wanted proof that this was a story people cared about.
So, he and a team launched a fundraising campaign through Legion M, a company that lets people back projects they want to see happen. The plan was to start with the comic book to drum up more interest, then set sights on a movie.
Almost as soon as the campaign was posted, donations started flooding in, Edwards said. As of Friday, the project had raised about $160,000.
That was enough to get the comic book started, Edwards said. Once that’s out in the world, his hope is that it will be compelling enough to prove people want to see a live-action movie about Smalls’ life.
In the meantime, comic books appeal to teenagers, which is the audience Edwards most wants to reach.
“The thing that I would most want to tell a 16-year-old is, ‘Hey, there was this guy, he was born a slave, and look what he did,’” Edwards said. “If he can do that, then think of the things you can do.”

Edwards partnered with illustrators Nikolas Draper-Ivey, who created the art that accompanies the soundtrack for Marvel’s “Black Panther,” and Ray-Anthony Height, a longtime comic book artist who has created illustrations for Marvel and Star Wars comics.
The comic book, titled “DEFIANT: The Story of Robert Smalls,” is set for release June 19, which is also Juneteenth, a federal holiday celebrating the day slaves in Texas learned they were free in 1865.
The release date has become especially significant after the Defense Intelligence Agency ordered a pause in events related to Juneteenth, alongside other holidays, following an executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs earlier this year, Edwards said.
“We’re in this really interesting time when I think inspirational stories like ‘DEFIANT’ are really, really important,” Edwards said. “I’m thrilled that we’re able to be part of the Juneteenth celebration with this book.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-08-at-3.50.25-PM-1024x581.png,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

(Photo by Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

But he could have been after putting a loaded pistol in his mouth in October 2021. 
Terhune had been deployed to Iraq in 2003 and again in 2007. His second two-year mission was cut short in 2008 after he contracted leishmaniasis, which causes skin lesions and ulcers, and was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment.

He retired from the Reserves in 2015 after 24 years in service and later from his position at the Tallahassee Fire Department, where he worked for 28 years, in 2020.
The separations, though, left him feeling lost.
“I couldn’t take it anymore and the hurt, the pain,” Terhune said. “It was physical pain that was eating my gut, my kidneys. I walked out on my back patio with my pistol, and after my wife and kids went to school, and I said, ‘I’m done. I just can’t do this.’ 
“And as I’m sticking the pistol in my mouth, Tyler, my friend who killed himself the year prior, was standing in front of me. And call it divine intervention or whatever. But he said, ‘Doc, stop. You have so much more to give.’ And then he was gone,” Terhuune recalled in an interview.
“It was almost like a slap in the face. And I thought it was the bullet honestly going through my head — that’s what I thought the slap in the face was. But I realized at that point. I said, ‘What am I doing?’ And I threw the gun down.”
Terhune immediately called a counselor he and his wife had been seeing for couples therapy. While he had been going to counseling, he’d never been put on medication. He found, however, that that was a necessary part of the solution for him.
Now Terhune runs a nonprofit organization, Team Guardian Inc.
“I feel like I’ve been given this opportunity to tell this story, because everybody who knows me is like, ‘What? There is no way that I would have ever thought that you would have gone down this road.’” Terhune said.  
“And so now I run a nonprofit, do a bunch of veteran stuff. But basically it’s about being there. I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, and I’ve had people call me, you know, crying and saying, ‘You know, I need help.’ And I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, go to your house, and sit and talk and get you through this.”
The Fire Watch
The National Library of Medicine notes that “suicide is a major public health challenge that disproportionately affects service members and veterans.” And for the past 12 years, suicide rates have been consistently higher among veterans than nonveterans.
Six hundred and twenty-two Florida military veterans killed themselves in 2023, the latest available data. That’s a dip from 655 veteran suicides in 2022 but an increase from the 612 Florida military veterans who killed themselves in 2021. 
But another effort to identify and help veterans at risk of suicide is showing signs of success in Florida.
Veteran suicide rates in the state dropped by 5% between 2019 and 2023, compared to just 1% nationally. But in a five-county area in Northeast Florida, the suicide rate dropped by 25% between 2019 and 2023, from 81 to 61, Florida Department of Health data show.
Nick Howland maintains that his organization, The Fire Watch, is helping to drive down the suicide rate in Duval, Clay, Baker, St. Johns, and Nassau counties through its “Watch Stander” program.
Since starting the program in Jacksonville in 2019, Howland and other founding members of The Fire Watch took a page from the American Heart Association, which in 1960 launched a closed-chest cardiac resuscitation course for physicians. It was the forerunner of CPR training for the general public.
Under the model, participants take a 45-minute course learning what is called “SAVE” training, teaching the “SIGNS” of crisis: ASK the veterans if they are considering suicide; VALIDATE the veterans’ experience; and EXPEDITE getting the veteran help. 
“Basically, what we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need,” Howland said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“It’s inspired by CPR, because, you know, CPR basically isn’t training you to be a paramedic or a cardiologist. It’s training you to recognize when something’s different and to get help quick. And that’s what we’re doing.”
For Howland, the key to the program is broad community involvement, not just buy-in from the veterans community.
“There’s only 9% of the country who has served. So, if you’re relying on that 9% of the country to get veterans who are showing risk science to help, you’re leaving out a whole section, 91% of the people, who could be helping,” he told the Florida Phoenix. 
“What we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need. “
Half of the 9,000 volunteer watch-standers, he said, reside in northeast Florida.
The program expanded to Hillsborough, Pinellas, Broward, Palm Beach, and Escambia Counties two years after its launch. The expansion locations have collectively experienced a 12% reduction in veteran suicides, according to Howland.
The other 57 counties lacking The Watch Stander program experienced a collective 2% reduction in veteran suicide rates, he said.
All of Howland’s statistics are based on Department of Health CHARTS (community health assessment resource tools data) and U.S. Census American Community Survey data. 
Meeting its goals
The Fire Watch has a vision statement: To end veteran suicide by preventing veteran suicide.
But that takes time.
The Fire Watch’s goals this year are to train 10,000 volunteers through its Watch Standers program, hoping that 70% of them interact with veterans quarterly and that 30% of the veterans with whom watch-standers interact will be referred for health care services.
It appears to be on track to meet those goals. 
The Centers for Disease Control Foundation developed a quarterly survey for The Fire Watch to track volunteer watch-standers’ efforts. The data show that since the second quarter of 2023, at least 76% of watch-finders have engaged with a veteran and that there’s never been under than a 31% referral rate (with a high 48% referral rate in 3Q 2024).
Howland’s third goal is to reduce suicide rates by 25% for three consecutive years in the 10-county area.
To date, that goal has proven more elusive.
Although there’s been a 25% reduction in veteran suicides between 2019 and 2023, the number per year has gone up and down. The number in Northeast Florida dropped to 38 in 2021 but jumped to 59 the following year, mostly due to an increase in Duval County.
The number of veteran suicides in Duval County nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022 jumping from 22 to 41, respectively.
As for Terhune, he said he has a list of people he contacts weekly.
“Whether they have medical issues or they’re struggling mentally or whatever else. I go down this list and I call them, and that could be that slap in the face, you know, someone sitting there with a pistol in their lap, getting ready to shoot themselves. And that could be that time that makes them rethink that, or stop, or realize that they do have more to give.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on May 22.The City of South Burlington is pausing its effort to expand local voting rights to all legal residents.All resident voting would allow all the city’s legal residents, including those who are noncitizens, to vote in local elections and other supplementary school or city votes. The idea was first brought to the city council by the city’s Democratic committee last September with the hopes of having it placed on this year’s Town Meeting Day ballot. Since this would require a charter change, the city must bring the question to the voters for approval.While the committee at the time said it needed more time to study the issue, its final report recommended against moving forward at this time.Even the charter committee’s own members were split 4-3 on the decision. Committee members opposed to the expansion said, given the tense political climate, enabling people to put their names on a public list of legal non-citizens could make those people targets of federal retaliation, they said.They also said that, in this hostile environment, the committee would be unable to obtain useful information from the relevant South Burlington community to help them understand whether legal residents even want this change.“I immediately made the motion that we should put this thing in the freezer and wait, for humanitarian reasons,” Wendell Coleman, a member of the charter committee, told city council Monday.Anne LaLonde, another member of the committee, offered a different perspective.“This definitely, clearly comes from a place of empathy, and I understand that it’s a frightening time for noncitizens in the United States, whether you have a green card, whether you don’t, I think that’s a completely valid point of view,” she said. “But I would say I think legal residents of South Burlington should be able to choose for themselves whether or not to register to vote.”In the report, they listed an executive order by President Donald Trump that among other things, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to “ensure that state and local officials have access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered” and to “take all lawful and appropriate action to make available information from relevant databases to state and local election officials engaged in verifying the citizenship of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.”Committee members say it is unclear whether registered local non-citizen voters would be in Vermont’s database or in Vermont’s “publicly available voter registration list,” creating safety concerns for some residents.Other pending federal legislation would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in elections for federal office. And it remains murky what exactly that means for local elections, the committee wrote in its report.Three Vermont cities — Winooski, Montpelier and Burlington — have already allowed voting for all legal residents.All three cities have been challenged in court and upheld, but plaintiffs in the Burlington case have recently filed an appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. That case is still ongoing.The committee undertook a series of public outreach initiatives, interviewing the clerks in each of the three cities and reaching out to several community groups to gauge feedback on how this topic would be received by legal permanent residents or new naturalized citizens.While council chair Tim Barritt had more of an appetite to continue the work now, other members of the council concurred with the committee’s recommendation. Aside from all councilors holding the moral standpoint that those who pay taxes should be able to vote on issues that pertain to the city, from a practical standpoint, the issue could prove difficult.“I think before we proceed, we need to have some confidence that the runway is not a very long runway, but a runway that actually is a genuine question that people should put thought to and make a decision,” councilor Mike Scanlan said.Before the vote to conclude the discussion, the committee had talked about continuing outreach to community groups and impacted community members and if the city council takes this issue up in the future, it could build off the plan to do community outreach to obtain more information and learn more about public opinion.“I’m full steam ahead,” Barritt said. “We’re operating out of fear for these individuals who might want to vote, and I understand that, but there almost is never a good time, so to speak, when you have situations like this, and we don’t know what’s going to unfold.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  South Burlington city hits pause on voting for all residents.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/south-burlington-1-20211110.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Feb. 8 (Anna Spoerre/The Missouri Independent).The last time Missouri was in danger of losing an NFL franchise, deep disagreements between the governor and lawmakers over whether the state should pay for a new stadium led to litigation and the threat of a constitutional showdown.
It was 10 years ago when then-Gov. Jay Nixon and the legislature quarreled over a $1 billion plan to build a new St. Louis stadium for the Rams. 
Expecting GOP resistance, Nixon, a Democrat, came up with a strategy that didn’t involve the legislature. That sparked a group of legislators to file a lawsuit to block Nixon’s plan and threaten to refuse to allocate money the governor committed to the stadium when the General Assembly reconvened in January 2016. 
But that looming clash fizzled when the Rams announced an intention to move to Los Angeles two days before the 2016 session began. NFL owners overwhelmingly agreed to let them do it soon after.

A decade later, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is pushing a plan for the state to pay up to half the costs of a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals and renovations to Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030, and Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
Kehoe has one advantage Nixon didn’t — a legislature dominated by his own party. But while the governor successfully convinced the Missouri House to sign off on a stadium funding plan earlier this month in the final days of the session, the Senate was in no mood to play ball. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, alerted his colleagues on Friday that the governor is expected to call the legislature back into session as early as next week to debate stadium funding. The governor may also include a $500 million construction package on the special session agenda, a move seen as vital to winning over support in the Senate for any stadium plan. 
But with partisan tensions running high after a tumultuous end to the regular legislative session, and serious heartburn among Republicans over the idea of spending hundreds of millions to subsidize sports franchises, the outcome is anything but certain. 
“I love the Kansas City Chiefs. I’m obnoxious during football season,” state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersville, said in a recent interview with KSGF. “… But I’ve got constituents trying to pay their rent and feed themselves, and they’re struggling. And I’m going to take their money and give it to billionaires so multimillionaires can play in a prettier place? That’s obscene.”
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, said state funding for stadiums is “an easy demagogue topic.” But losing the teams to Kansas, she contends, would cost much more than the proposal put forth by the governor. 
“My personal belief is both the direct and indirect dollars accruing to Missouri businesses from the Chiefs and Royals being located here far exceeds what they are asking,” she wrote on social media. “I also believe if they left the state it would tear out the heart of Missouri, leaving two big concrete structures as a forever reminder of what might have been.”
Governor’s plan for Chiefs, Royals stadium funding derailed in the Missouri Senate

The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept the offer from Kansas.
The proposal floated by Kehoe and set to be debated next week would pay up to half the cost — estimated to be up to $3 billion — as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams. 
The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and paid sick leave. The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
There is also lingering bipartisan anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk a capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
The rollout of Kehoe’s plan didn’t help soothe the tensions.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle complained that the governor kept the legislature in the dark on stadium funding plans, then demanded it sign off on the proposal with little debate and no details on the cost.
The lack of legislative involvement echoes 2015, when lawmakers took umbrage at Nixon’s efforts to work around them by trying to use existing incentive programs to help fund a new St. Louis stadium.  Republicans and Democrats demanded Nixon either submit a proposal to the legislature or put it on the ballot for a vote. 
 “We will not stand idly by as the people of this state are committed to millions of dollars in debt without proper legislative approval or a public vote,” a group of House members said in a letter to Nixon at the time.
Lawmakers will get their wish this time around to have a say on whether Missouri taxpayers should help subsidize Kansas City stadiums. 
Kehoe is optimistic, arguing that keeping the teams in Missouri “is a critical piece of economic development. And I’d like to see us make sure we can solidify our offer with legislative approval.”

Vermont hospitals are charging more than five times the average sales price for outpatient drugs — the highest markup in the nation by a wide margin. Lawmakers are seeking to cap those prices.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerLast year, Andy Kehler, a co-owner of Jasper Hill Farm, was looking to renew his employees’ health insurance plans.The first quote the Greensboro-based cheesemaker received — for an “apples to apples” renewal of the plans, Kehler said in an interview — would have cost 74% more than the 2024 plans. For a company with flat sales, now facing the threat of tariffs on its sales to Canada, the increase was nigh unaffordable, he said. “We ended up scrambling to get an only 44% increase,” Kehler said. “That’s just ridiculous. It’s completely unsustainable.”One big factor driving that price tag up: drugs. Jasper Hill is paying tens of thousands of dollars — a significant chunk of its roughly $300,000 annual health care costs — for pharmaceuticals to treat an employee’s autoimmune condition, Kehler said. The company is grappling with one of the state’s dubious distinctions. According to data from 2020 through 2022 compiled by RAND, a national policy think tank, Vermont has the nation’s highest prices for outpatient pharmaceuticals, by a wide margin. In Vermont, the average prices of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs — meaning, drugs administered to patients without admitting them to hospitals — are more than five times the manufacturers’ average sale prices, according to RAND. That’s the highest average markup out of all 50 states.Andy and Mateo Kehler, co-owners of Jasper Hill Farm. The cheesemaker has faced steep hikes in its insurance costs, driven in large part by outpatient drug prices. Photo courtesy of Andy KehlerOver the past several weeks, as lawmakers seek to rein in skyrocketing health care costs, that statistic has sparked criticism — and a legislative effort to cap those prices. “I can’t move beyond the immorality of this,” Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex, the chair of the Vermont House Committee on Health Care, told a hospital lobbyist Tuesday.“How is this not price-gouging?” she added. Low federal payoutsOutpatient pharmaceutical drugs are generally administered via injection or infusion in hospitals or clinics, rather than dispensed by a pharmacy. These are generally specialty drugs used to treat cancer, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune disorders or other conditions.“These tend to be drugs where you have a doctor and a nurse watching you while you’re taking the drug to make sure it’s working,” Sara Teachout, a lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, said in an interview. Some hospitals are able to buy some of the drugs in question at a discount under a federal program called 340B. And yet, according to data Teachout presented to lawmakers last week, the markups for some of those drugs are steep. At the University of Vermont Medical Center, for example, one cancer treatment drug, Neulasta, costs private insurance nearly 70 times the manufacturer’s average sales price. Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, said on the House floor Friday that that markup means Vermonters who need that drug may pay $95,000 a year for Neulasta — compared with an average sales price of $1,357 a year. It’s not clear  — even to the state’s hospital association — why Vermont’s drug markups are so large. Vermont has the highest markups on outpatient drugs in the nation, according to RAND’s analysis of data from 2020 through 2022. Screenshot via RAND “I don’t know exactly why we’re so high,” Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, said in an interview. She said that she was not sure hospitals were even aware of the state’s disproportionate costs.But Green said she believes the reason has to do with low payments from the federal government’s Medicare and Medicaid programs. According to data compiled by a hospital consultant for Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, Vermont receives smaller Medicare payments than all other states for a variety of hospital procedures.“The hospitals in Vermont are the least paid (by Medicare) of any hospitals in any state in the union,” James Trimarchi, Southwestern Vermont’s planning director, said in an interview Thursday. The reason for that? “We don’t know,” Trimarchi said. Medicare calculates reimbursement rates based on numerous factors, including the procedure, type of facility and geographic region. “I hesitate to speculate,” he said. But, he noted, when Medicare reimbursements do not cover the cost of the procedures they help pay for, hospitals must make up the losses elsewhere — such as prices charged to private insurance for commercial drugs. ‘I do find it cruel’Some health care players, however, expressed doubt about that logic.“There are many reasons that Medicare reimbursements may be low, and I’m not sure that I necessarily agree with the premise,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers in the House health care committee Wednesday. He wondered whether Vermont’s hospital leaders are doing all they can to maximize their Medicare reimbursements — and why they weren’t dipping into cash reserves rather than hiking prices for drugs. “I do have to say that I do find it cruel to charge enormous markups on life-saving treatments to patients who are incredibly sick,” he said. On Thursday, Vermont’s House health care committee voted unanimously to advance an amendment that would cap those drug costs at 130% of their average sales price starting July 1, and 120% of their average sales price starting January 2026.The amendment, part of a larger bill relating to drug pricing, passed out of the House Friday and now heads to the Senate. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has said that the proposal could reduce their requested premiums — which are expected to rise by double digit percentages — by four percentage points for individual and small group insurance plans on the health care marketplace, and three percentage points for school health insurance plans. The Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, however, said the proposed legislation would cause millions of dollars in losses, and would require multiple Vermont hospitals to cut staff or services. Asked in an interview later that day about the morality of charging large markups on critical pharmaceuticals, Green, the hospital lobbyist, paused for a long time. “I do not think that it is right,” she said finally. “And I think it is an unfortunate byproduct of a very flawed way of paying for health care.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘How is this not price-gouging?’: Hospital drug markups spark legislation, anger .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/prescription-pricing-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

In Randolph and Rutland, bowling centers are keeping up the sport — and the camaraderie it inspires.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont bowling alleys preserving retro fun while facing biz trends.","A competitor eyes up a single pin during an Easter Day competition at Rutland Bowlerama. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSEliza Walsh is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Rick Wilbur surveyed each lane at Rutland Bowlerama, marking up a scoresheet as pins crashed, high-fives smacked and kids scurried around decked-out competitors. It was a mid-April night of bowling in this year’s Green Mountain Open Tournament, and Wilbur, who’s been around the Rutland alley for over 50 years, was right at home. His family has been coming to Bowlerama for decades; he’s competed as a bowler for close to six. He started teaching his son Jon the craft of the game when the boy was 10 years old. Twenty-six years later, in 2019, Wilbur watched his son become the first Vermonter and 35th person in the U.S. to bowl a 900 series in open league play, achieving three consecutive perfect games in one set — all at Bowlerama on a Monday night. As Wilbur meandered his way among the lanes last month, regulars at the bowling alley patted his back and chatted with him while he kept score.“Being that I’ve been here so long, it’s like a family reunion every weekend,” he said. Rick Wilbur, Rutland Bowlerama employee, poses with his favorite bowling ball: a realistic eyeball. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSOwner Chip Forte came into the business shortly after his grandparents started the institution in 1965. Originally a 16-lane bowling house, the facility is now 32 lanes large, many of which still boast the original wood. Ron Carrara, lifelong Rutland resident, has worked maintenance at Bowlerama since he was a kid and grew up with Forte and his family — Forte’s mom being his Boy Scouts den mother. “It’s changed a lot,” Carrara said. “In the early ’70s this place was packed. Now, we’re lucky if we fill 10 or 12 lanes.” Bowling seems to be a dying pastime, with digital technology taking the forefront in family entertainment. According to industry firm Hansell Group, the U.S. had around 5,800 sanctioned bowling centers and nearly 120,000 lanes in 2003. By 2019, there were about 4,500 commercial centers with around 95,000 lanes in operation, the group reported.Increasingly, old bowling alleys nationwide have been converted into facilities offering a host of other games, activities and amenities. And new businesses opening up have focused on sleek, upscale experiences, according to the same report.But for the few rural bowling centers in Vermont, old school charm and long community ties have been tough to beat. Bowlerama still uses the analog keypads installed in the 1990s, and prior to that the center relied on halogen-lit, handwritten scorecards.Isaiah “Grizzly” Turgeon starts to count scores near the end of the competition on Easter Sunday at the Rutland Bowlerama. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSWhile the regular crowd at Rutland Bowlerama isn’t what it used to be, the business had no trouble filling out its lanes for the Green Mountain Open Tournament, which participants traveled hours across New England to attend. “We have a lot of leagues, we have a lot of competition, we have a lot of fun,” Wilbur said. He is a coach for a local youth league and often helps out with Addison County Special Olympics events. The varsity bowling team at Fair Haven Union High School plays and practices at Bowlerama as well. The school has been in something of a friendly interstate rivalry with Randolph Union High School, and the two teams have duked it out at Bowlerama and elsewhere in recent years. Randolph is home to Valley Bowl, which holds a similar spirit to Bowlerama — the open game rate is $5 per hour with $3 shoe rentals and has been since the place opened in 2006. The year prior, the town’s only bowling center, Rose Bowl, closed after being sold to a New York developer who wanted to open a Family Dollar. Couple Karen and Wayne Warner, avid bowlers, had made a bid to buy the property but lost out.  A corkboard displays photos from years of bowlers past. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSSo they bought all the bowling alley’s lanes and equipment off the old owner, built Valley Bowl on Prince Street and opened in January 2006. Karen Warner also runs the area’s Special Olympics program and has been coaching the Randolph Union bowling team for the past 10 years.Valley Bowl recently started up a kids-bowl-free promotion, which offers two free games a day to minors all the way through the summer. “What we try to do is grow a love of the sport,” said Warner. “We certainly see a lot of that come to fruition.”Warner drills balls at the Valley Bowl pro shop, one of the few in-house pro shops in that part of Vermont, and helps with many of the other needs of local bowlers. She’s familiar with the folks at Rutland Bowlerama and has crossed paths with them many times while coaching. “Fair Haven and us were in the finals this year,” Warner said. “They ended up coming out on top. They wanted it, and sometimes it’s about that want. They’re a fun group of kids.”Wilbur and Warner have also banded together to coach for the regional Senior Classic, a competition where the top 10 Vermont high school seniors go up against the top 10 seniors from New Hampshire. A competitor lets one rip during Rutland Bowlerama’s Easter Sunday competition. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNS“We all came together to coach these kids. It was a lot of fun,” Warner said. The two haunts preserve a sense of retro family fun in Vermont. Still, business continues to decline as bowling becomes a less fashionable form of recreation. “When one of these VT bowling houses closes, it’s not good for any of us,” said Warner. “It’s always good to see those guys, to talk to them as a resource. Maybe that doesn’t happen in other places, but it happens in this town.”Said Wilbur, “Seems like every three months, everything changes.” A retired police officer, Wilbur doesn’t let the slump get him down. He still bowls in a league every year from August to April, coming in recreationally with family and friends during the off season. It’s even a family tradition to bowl on Christmas Eve. “It’s just fun,” Wilbur said. “I think I was put here for this reason.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont bowling alleys preserving retro fun while facing biz trends.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morrissey_Rutland_Bowlerama-13-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

[…],"Jen Kruse, from Tipton, holds up a sign in protest of the Missouri State Legislature's decision to pass legislation to overturn voters' recent ballot measures. ""I wish reason would take over,"" she told The Independent. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Maybe you collected signatures last year so that Missourians could vote to overturn the state’s abortion ban. 
Maybe you walked door to door asking voters to support paid sick leave benefits for lower-wage workers.
Maybe you were one of millions of people who successfully voted to pass those measures on the statewide ballot last November.
Republicans in the Missouri legislature want you to go pound sand. They are not impressed with your hard work, or the sanctity of your vote, or your show of direct democracy. 
They have convictions to uphold, special interests to please and power to wield. And so, in a breathtaking show of arrogance, they wrapped up the 2025 legislative session by stomping all over the wishes of the state’s voters. 
First, Republicans passed a proposed constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would negate the freedoms won in Amendment 3, which enshrined the right to an abortion in the Missouri Constitution.
The just-passed Republican amendment seeks to deceive. Its language — which will likely be challenged in court — creates a narrow window in which victims of rape and incest and women with a medical emergency can obtain an abortion. It doesn’t mention that abortion will be banned for everyone else.
Following this betrayal of women, lawmakers moved on to workers.
They gutted a statute known as Proposition A, initiated by citizens, that passed with a hefty 58% of the vote. No citizens’ initiative is safe from the vicissitudes of Missouri’s Republican supermajority.
Lawmakers struck down a paid sick leave provision. They left intact a minimum wage increase but erased a provision that would have attached future increases to the rate of inflation. By the time the 2025 legislature mercifully adjourned, Prop A was a shadow of what its organizers had intended.
This is by no means the first time Missouri’s Republican supermajority has overturned the will of voters. Legislators have altered voter-initiated statutes in recent years having to do with puppy mills and redistricting and campaign finance. 
Constitutional amendments are somewhat less subject to damage, but Republicans nonetheless tried to thwart an amendment calling for expansion of Medicaid eligibility by refusing to grant the funding until ordered to do so by a court.
During that fracas, in 2021, a then-Republican legislator said the quiet part out loud. 
“I am proud to stand against the will of the people,” Justin Hill, a representative from the St. Louis area, declared from the House floor.
There you have it.
Most Republicans prefer to frame their disregard for voters a bit more diplomatically.
“Those who support conservative measures and vote us into office expect us to stand our ground on issues which reflect their bedrock beliefs,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin said on social media after Republicans gutted the two voter initiatives this month. 
This willingness of voters to support progressive measures while simultaneously electing rock-solid conservative legislators is indeed the great disconnect in Missouri politics.
But almost six of 10 voters supported paid sick leave for low-wage workers. That seems quite bedrock. The people expecting lawmakers to “stand their ground” on this particular issue are select business interests which are powerful in Jefferson City.
“I am proud of all my colleagues for taking a stand for what we consider right,” O’Laughlin added in her social media post. 
Which is just a short hop, skip and jump away from “I am proud to stand against the will of the people.” 
Republican lawmakers count on voters across the state to not watch what they do too closely, and to forget about their outrages once the session adjourns.
But if anything grabs the attention of Missourians, it could be this latest double punch. 
Prompted by groups such as Missouri Jobs for Justice and the recently formed Respect Missouri Voters, protesters convened at the Capitol and in locations around the state.
On the protest lines, they mingled with people out and about objecting to Trump administration policies. That’s a willing audience, already in the streets, just waiting to be informed about what the state legislators are up to.
And for those who missed the rallies, volunteers are distributing flyers at the homes of voters in legislative districts where Proposition A garnered more support in November than the Republican lawmakers representing the district. 
That includes House Speaker Jon Patterson’s district in Lee’s Summit.
Patterson didn’t vote for the House measure seeking to reinstate an abortion ban, but he didn’t do much to slow it down, either. And his explanation that he supports paid sick leave but voted to gut Prop A because he doesn’t think state government should mandate the benefit is double talk.
Across Missouri, workers who are finally accruing sick time are being told that the benefit will be taken away from them. And people who only a few months ago celebrated the end of an abortion ban are finding out that they’ll have to go back to work to preserve a right they legitimately won.
A simple question keeps coming up: How can they do this to us?
They do it because they can.
Until enough voters decide they can’t.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Wes Moore said it needed more study, writes J.H. Snider. But a year later, there's been no study, the issue has come and gone and this year's version of the bill failed.","A worker poses by the presses of the Daily Republic in Fairfield, California, in this 2018 file photo. (Photo by Staff Sgt. Amber Carter/U.S. Air Force)Maryland law mandates that estate beneficiaries pay hundreds of dollars, plus transaction costs, to place legal ads in a local newspaper announcing an estate’s opening.
In 2024 and 2025, Maryland’s legislature introduced bills to revoke that mandate and instead allow such notices to be posted for free on a more publicly accessible government website.
Experts knowledgeable about estate legal ads know that virtually no potential beneficiaries and creditors learn about a deceased person via such ads. But the mandate is politically impregnable because it benefits one of Maryland’s most politically powerful industries at the expense of the politically weak; that is, monopoly local newspapers receive millions of dollars per year while the average Marylander only pays hundreds of dollars per lifetime.
This incentive structure of concentrated industry benefits and diffuse public costs constitutes the classic incentive structure of special interest politics. The problem is compounded by the local newspaper lobby’s unique power, as reflected in the politicians’ motto: “Never pick a fight with anyone who buys ink by the barrel.”

Today, Maryland mandates some 190 separate statutory legal ad subsidies for the local newspaper industry, of which the estate subsidy is only one.  But the industry worries that revoking even one of these subsidies will cause a domino effect, so fights accordingly.
The case against the obsolete estate legal ad mandate was so compelling that the 2024 legislation revoking it passed both the Maryland House and Senate unanimously (175-0). (Assisting such support, when the bill was introduced, Maryland’s leading newspaper chain was owned by an unpopular, out-of-state hedge fund.)
But Gov. Wes Moore then vetoed the legislation, justifying his veto on the basis that the issue needed more study:
“This veto should not be seen as the end of the conversation, and in fact the administration believes we need a broader conversation about public notices rather than a conversation focused solely on estate notices. Our administration looks forward to engaging with … all of the advocates on that topic during the interim,” he wrote.
This year the same bill was introduced in the legislature and again passed unanimously (132-0) in the House. But it wasn’t allowed even a vote in the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, whose chair, as is said in Annapolis, “placed the bill in his desk.” The chair didn’t respond to my written query asking him to explain his opposition.
I first got a sense of how dirty newspaper legal ad politics was when decades ago I tried to gather data to study them. I had worked at a D.C. think tank studying media public policy and knew that legal ads were the newspaper industry’s largest government subsidy.
No scholarly data existed on this subject because other scholars who had tried to study such subsidies had run up against the same brick wall I had; that is, I could find no industry data because national and state newspaper organizations, while aggressively lobbying for such subsidies, had refused to provide authoritative data on them, and politicians were too terrified of the industry’s political power to ask how much their subsidies cost the public. So most Maryland legislative sessions some legislation passes that expands legal ad newspaper subsidies without accountability provisions.
I was curious: Did the governor fulfill his veto statement’s promises? The answer is no. In the year between the end of the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, neither the Governor nor his staff participated in, let alone orchestrated, such a public discussion.
My sense is that the best hope to eliminate Maryland’s obsolete estate legal ad laws would be to shame the governor into acting consistent with his own stated values, as he has promised to support the poor and politically weak, and that’s whom estate legal ads most hurt. On the other hand, since the media have negligible incentive to expose this hypocrisy, such hope appears quixotic. Moreover, the governor’s politically astute aides have undoubtedly counseled him not to risk the newspaper industry’s wrath, given its power to shape his and his opponents’ public image.
Conversely, recall that the governor won a Bronze Star for bravery. Accordingly, the governor should convene his promised public forum to discuss the merits of newspaper legal ads. Until then, he should instruct his staff to stop lobbying to kill legislation that only reduces but not expands legal ad subsidies. (The largest new newspaper subsidy last session reduced newspapers’ legal ad costs).
If the governor’s policy is only to call for public discussion when reducing but not increasing newspaper industry subsidies, that double standard should be called out.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4993621-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Credit: Tracey AttleeMore than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(Photo by Pat Kinney with background via Canva)MARSHALLTOWN — Ralph Alshouse hadn’t even seen an airplane until he was in his teens.
That was about 90 years ago. He’d see a lot of planes — from the inside —throughout World War II.
Now 101, he can recall a few times he may not have lived to 21 by the time the war ended in 1945.
But he knew from his dad, who saw trench warfare in World War I, that if he went to war, an airplane was where he wanted to be.
Alshouse, a resident of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, was a Navy pilot who delivered or “ferried” planes all over the country from the manufacturer to be loaded on to aircraft carriers, or brought battle-worn craft into repair shops. He was part of Ferry Squadron VRF-2, based in Columbus, Ohio, but flew to installations nationwide.
Growing up near Oelwein and graduating from high school in Stanley in 1941, he went into the Navy shortly after Pearl Harbor.
The duty was hazardous enough, flying various aircraft which had equally varying and challenging capabilities. He had 13 emergency landings during the war, out of 146 flights and more than 1600 hours flight time, involving 28 different kinds of naval aircraft, ranging from small Piper Cub medical evacuation ambulance planes, to Marine Corsair and Navy Helldiver fighter-bombers to multi-engine heavy bombers like the B-24 Liberator or its Navy version, the PB4Y-2 Privateer.
On one nighttime training flight, he dodged an encounter with a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico. Two other cadets weren’t as fortunate.
“We were flying out of Pensacola Naval Air Base (in Florida), flying (Vought) OS2Us (Kingfisher observation float planes). Each of us had one. It was the final phase of our training before we got our wings. And three of us went out, and I was the only one to make it back. We were in the Gulf. We hit a line cloud out there they didn’t know about. And I told the other two guys, ‘I’m gonna turn (away from the storm); so let’s all turn.’ They said, “No, no our orders are to go straight.’ ”
He radioed out and received clearance to turn; the other cadets didn’t pick up the message over the static. He radioed back to them after making the turn but received no answer.

“I thought ‘Well, I better head back to base.’ There was no light, darker than hell, and my first thought was, ‘Oh s–t, I must be lost.’ And then all at once I saw the flicker of the (airfield) beacons. When you’re think you’re lost out at sea, in the middle of the night, and you see a beacon, boy, that makes you feel better.
“We went out the next morning with everything that flew; I think there was eight to us,” looking for the missing pilots, Alshouse said. “And we didn’t find a thing.”
On another occasion, he was pulling a target behind him for gunnery practice for other planes — only to get shot at himself. He discovered dents in his own craft after landing. Had the pilots been using a higher caliber ammunition in practice, the outcome might had been far different.
While ferrying a small medical evacuation plane from Florida to a shop near Memphis, Tenn., for repairs — basically a flying ambulance with space for one patient in the rear of the cockpit — he touched down at the scene of a serious multiple-injury automobile accident and picked up the victim in the worst condition for transport for medical treatment. He taxied off the pavement as highway patrol officers at the scene cleared the road for him to take off.
Among other narrow escapes, he also made a forced landing in Pittsburgh of a Corsair fighter plane on fire. In another instance, he and comrades rescued another pilot from a downed, burning plane before it exploded.
Alshouse, a 1948 graduate of Iowa State University in dairy science, is retired from work as a farmer, Farmers Home Administration farm appraiser at different locations around the state. He also served a stint as the mayor of Seymour in Wayne County near Centerville southeast of Des Moines.
He’s a former chairman of the Rathbun Area Solid Waste Commission. In 2018, he was recognized by a recycling customer, Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, for helping provide commission land to the college to start a sustainable agriculture program.

He found another more recent calling — as an author. He jotted down memories of his service to his offspring. A fellow former military pilot he met at a veteran dinner in Seymour, retired U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Mark Hewitt, suggested he write a book. He had no intention of such thing, but discovered he in fact already had enough material for one, if he combined all his written recollections.
He fused all those reminiscences into a book, entitled “80 Percent Luck, 20 Percent Skill.” It was published in 2023 and is available online on Amazon and through Barnes & Noble.
Alshouse saw his first plane as he was working for his dad in the farm field near Oelwein.
“I was cultivating beans one day. It landed in the hay field south of where I was cultivating beans,” he said. “Two gentlemen in business suits got out,” a car picked them up, “and they left the airplane.” They may have been going to a nearby farm on business on a property that had been through foreclosure.
His father came over from an adjacent field. Ralph came up on the plane, a Club Cadet, and peeked inside. “My God, all those instruments and all those controls.” he said. “I told Dad it must take a genius to fly one of those.
“That gave me the urge,” he said, “after Dad told me about all the guys that was killed in no man’s land in World War I. There was so much gunfire the trees fell over and they stacked the bodies up like cordwood and get behind them (for cover) to shoot. That helped me commit to being in the air instead of on the ground.”
He saw advertisements in the local paper seeking applicants for flight training. Lacking applicants, the standards were lowered from a four-year college degree, to a two-year degree, to high schools. “That’s when I stepped in,” he said. He and other enlistees didn’t know the different between the advantages of different branches of service, “we just wanted to fly.”
He took testing and training in Decorah, Minneapolis and pre-flight training at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where he became a champion boxer in his class. “I never had a pair of boxing gloves on before, but I won the championship,” though he quipped, “My nose always got in the way.” He was bloodied a few times.
“We had about a 25 percent washout rate at Iowa City,” he said. He received flight training at the naval air installation at Wold Chamberlain Airport in Minneapolis, and then to Pensacola for training in catapult-launched scout planes like the kind used on various naval ships at that time.
“I got shot off a catapult three times in flight training,” he said “If you think you know what happiness is, that’s when you’re happy, that you’re still alive” and flying after a catapult launch.
Ralph still flew some in civilian life after the war. He had an ultralight craft and still has a trophy from a glider competition he won in 1970.
And his flying skills allowed him to avoid another close call — as a farm appraiser.
When a shotgun-wielding farmer ordered Alshouse off the property, he complied — but still flew over the farm and conducted the appraisal by air.
He discovered that on many occasions in peacetime as well as war, it’s still safer by air than on the ground.

(Photo by Tracey Attlee/For Georgia Recorder)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. 
“Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.

(Courtesy of John Grinvalds)LINCOLN — After his fifth goodwill and fact-finding trip to war-torn Ukraine, a former Nebraska state legislator and decorated veteran still feels that Ukraine can prevail in its war with Russia if given the right weapons.
And former State Sen. Tom Brewer, who represented north-central Nebraska, said he sees a possible reckoning ahead for President Donald Trump in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin, he said, has never been truthful in his negotiations over the war, and his latest flirtations with peace talks may turn out to just be a delaying tactic to allow Russian forces to get organized for a summer offensive.
“There’s a huge game of chess that’s being played right now,” Brewer said in a recent interview. “I think the next month will bring to light that Putin is not serious about negotiations, he’s just buying time.”
“If you look at history, the Russians have never been honest about any of the negotiating they’ve done,” he added. “Why would they start now?”
Brewer, now 66, is at an age when most veterans are working on their golf game or heading out on a fishing trip. He’s had more than 70 surgeries to repair war wounds and a bad back. The trip by plane, train, bus and eventually Toyota 4Runners in the dark of night is long and grueling, over roads pock-marked by missile strikes.
But he keeps going back to Ukraine in part because he admires their freedom-loving spirit and in part because he feels his military experience — six tours of duty in Afghanistan and experience with artillery and helicopters — could help their war effort.
Reconstruction will require help
Eventually, he believes he could also help the reconstruction of a country known as the “bread basket of Europe.”
On this latest trip he was accompanied by Don Hutchens, a retired head of the Nebraska Corn Board and a veteran of foreign trade missions. They set up a video meeting with University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold and Ukraine’s ministers of agriculture and intelligence to lay the groundwork for possible collaboration in rebuilding Ukraine’s crop production.

Ukraine has lost more than 20% of its farmland since the Russians invaded, according to Alliance Magazine, and an estimated 139,000 square kilometers of land — almost twice the size of Nebraska — are suspected to hold land mines.
Brewer said that in areas where the Russians had occupied, anything of value was taken and farm machinery not taken was disabled. Farmers are left using old equipment in hopes of growing a crop, he said.
During his trip, Brewer visited associates of Howard Buffett, the son of Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett, who is on track to pass a total of $1 billion in private aid this year given to Ukraine to remove mines and provide new combines, planters and tractors.
“(Buffett) has a really good team over there that is well-organized,” he said. “He’s probably more highly thought of than anyone else in the country. If he wanted to run for president he could beat out (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelinskyy.”
Brewer also visited an orphanage under construction near Kyiv that has been supported by Ukrainian-Americans as well as a hospital where wounded soldiers are fitted for prosthetic limbs. An estimated 52,000 Ukrainians have lost parts of arms and legs in the war, he said, which has left possibly 18,000 children orphaned.
Some aid still coming
Some U.S. military aid is still reaching troops in Ukraine, he said, but the elimination of the USAID agency has meant an end of food shipments to those living in a “no-man’s land” near the front. Despite the pull back of some American aid, the Ukrainians provided a warm welcome back, Brewer said.
As after past trips, the former legislator will provide a trip report to the Nebraska delegation in Congress in hopes that makes a difference.

On this trip, Brewer watched young Ukrainian soldiers, fueled by Red Bull and vape pens, guiding attack drones and was impressed by the capability of an artillery team unit that got only three week’s training on guns the U.S. Army provides months of training to operate.
He said that if he was “king for a day,” the U.S. would provide more long-range missiles so that Russian forces could be moved farther away from the Ukrainian border to deter drone attacks and dropping of unguided “glide bombs.” Tougher sanctions, Brewer added, could help squeeze the Russian economy to the point that they would give up.
The former senator said he is sometimes “astounded” about how long it took the U.S. to provide the weaponry that is needed.
The sounds of drones buzzing overhead is a constant near the front, Brewer said, and the glide bombs, which cannot be detected by anti-missile batteries, have exacted a horrible toll.
He said that this war could completely reshape Europe and the future of democracy, and it’s important to stop Putin now, or else he will be emboldened to invade more countries. Brewer said he “hates” the idea that Ukraine would have to give up valuable territory to end the war.
“The only way to defeat (the Russians) is to defeat them on the battlefield,” he said, “and the only way to do that is give (Ukraine) the right weapons to do it.”
“Even though they’ve been through three years of war, and even though they’ve lost an estimated 100,000 civilian and military lives, their spirit is still passionate about staying free,” Brewer said.
“You’re not going to see the Ukrainian people say, ‘We’ve had enough.’ I think they’ll fight until they have nothing left to fight with.”

Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played ‘Taps.’ They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance of a near-normal season and a 10% chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.
The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins Sunday, June 1, and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms — including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125% of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130% of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51% chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26% chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33% chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56% chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

There are more than 4,000 unknown dead interred in the cemetery, which is administered by the U.S.Department of Veterans Affairs.

Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

(Credit: Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

The State Historical Society of North Dakota has about 10,000 military items, but only about 5% is displayed at one time. The new North Dakota Military Gallery, planned for the state Capitol grounds in Bismarck, will be able to showcase more of the collection.
Brig. Gen. Jackie Huber, deputy adjutant general for the North Dakota National Guard, said one unique aspect of the new museum is that it will focus on North Dakota’s role in the military and the stories of state service members serving abroad and at home.


How to donate
For information on how to donate an item for the museum collection, visit the Historical Society’s website.


“We have a number of Medal of Honor recipients that I think most North Dakotans don’t even know the stories behind them,” Huber said. “We are also going to incorporate Native American stories of the warrior culture before statehood, so that’s really unique, too.”
A groundbreaking for the North Dakota Military Gallery is expected mid-summer, with completion planned for fall 2027.
In anticipation, the Historical Society is looking to fill some gaps in its military collection, said Lori Nohner, research historian at the State Historical Society of North Dakota.
The collection begins with the Civil War and goes all the way through the Global War on Terror to current military items.

The collection features a handful of uniforms worn by soldiers who fought in the Civil War and who moved to the Dakota Territory following the conflict. One uniform was worn by a member of the Dakota Territory Guard, which was a precursor to the state’s National Guard.
“This was a guy from Wisconsin who came to North Dakota and homesteaded, and then he went back to Wisconsin, but he stayed long enough to be in the Guard,” Nohner said.
The Historical Society also has a Spanish-American War cavalry uniform worn by former state lawmaker Leslie Simpson of Dickinson and a Navy officers peacoat from World War II, worn by Lt. William Guy of Devils Lake who later became the 26th governor of North Dakota.
Guy served as a gunnery officer on the U.S. Navy Destroyer William D. Porter, which was sunk by kamikaze pilots near Okinawa, Japan in 1945.
“His original uniform is at the bottom of the ocean, so this is his uniform from the rest of his service during World War II,” Nohner said.

The collection needs more Coast Guard uniforms and items from the Navy after the Korean War, Nohner said. The Historical Society also is seeking more uniforms worn by women, Native Americans and other minorities.
When people donate old military uniforms and fatigues, Nohner said they’re asked to provide a story about the service member and a photo of the person in the uniform to stand alongside the collection.
“You can get some information just looking at a uniform, but you can’t get the whole story,” Nohner said. “You can’t get the personal stories. The real meaty, interesting histories.”
Nohner said some of her favorite military items are the less ceremonial items, such as physical training sweatsuits. She said the Historical Society would accept an iPod used by a service member during a deployment, or even military-issued underwear, socks and other everyday items.
“They are so ubiquitous, but no one seems to donate them to a museum because they wear them out,” she said. “They keep wearing them. That’s why we don’t have many boots from World War I because the soldiers would wear them when they got home.”
Nohner said personal items have become increasingly difficult to find. More recent service members are less likely to have letters or photographs they sent home.
The Historical Society also has a need for more modern, American-made military weaponry, she said.
“We have a lot of foreign weapons from World War I especially because they were taken as souvenirs and the War Department divvied up a lot of war trophies … to the states based on how many people per capita served,” Nohner said.

People who donate items to the collection can make appointments at the Heritage Center to view their items in the collection vaults. 
“There’s still a lot of things that we’re preserving for the next generation that maybe don’t go up on exhibit, so we’re happy to show any donors the items that they donated,” Nohner said.
She added the storage spaces housing the military uniforms and other items are climate-controlled to keep the artifacts at the right temperature, in the best humidity conditions and lighting to prevent fading.
The Historical Society and the North Dakota National Guard have been consulting about the new gallery since October and working together to determine the displays and content for the new museum, Nohner said.
The total cost of the Military Gallery is estimated at $77.9 million, with about half of the funding coming from the state and half coming from private donations to the North Dakota National Guard Foundation.
Lawmakers so far have approved $19.2 million in state funding, with some of the allocation contingent on private donations being pledged. Legislators earlier this year also approved a $20 million Bank of North Dakota line of credit for the museum and directed the Historical Society to request funding in 2027 if the loan is used. 
Huber, who also serves as president of the North Dakota National Guard Foundation, said about $8 million in private donations have been raised out of the $40 million fundraising goal. She said many donors were waiting to see how much the state planned to contribute. Fundraisers also are working to secure larger donations from corporations involved in the defense industry.
“We have got a number of pending proposals,” Huber said. “Nobody has said, ‘No,’ to it, if you can believe that, which is pretty incredible.”
The Historical Society is continuing to add to its video collection of thousands of veterans’ oral histories. Veterans interested in making a testimonial should make an appointment at the Heritage Center to record the first-hand stories of their service time.
“Our goal is to have these last for hundreds and hundreds of years, not just for the next generation, this is for several more generations,” Nohner said.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1296edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

(Courtesy of Honor and Remember Nebraska)OMAHA — It was a cold January day when an idea popped into Jim Meier’s head — why not plant a tree for every fallen soldier from Nebraska?
“It was just me talking to me,” said Meier, a Vietnam War veteran and tree lover, who jotted down the thought.
It’s a thought that has grown over three years into the planting of nearly 2,000 trees across the state as part of a “Nebraska Memorial Forest,” with small groves in Omaha, Lincoln, South Sioux City and Papillion.


Nebraska Memorial Forest

“It seems only worthy and appropriate to provide support and comfort for those who have fallen,” Meier said. “It’s such a small action we Nebraskans can take to pay tribute.”
The Omaha-based sports psychologist and development consultant has some experience in that realm already as director of Honor and Remember Nebraska, an all-volunteer nonprofit organization.
That group, founded in 2012, provides “honor and remember” flags for Gold Star families — those who have lost a loved one in active-duty military service — and “honor and sacrifice” flags for families who have lost a first responder or law enforcement officer.
Meier, 79, said the Memorial Forest trees are intended to be a “living memorial” to fallen heroes.
So far, 1,785 trees have been planted for the 7,500 soldiers, first responders and law enforcement officers “known” to have fallen.
On Memorial Day, Meier’s group will dedicate groves of 50 trees in Valentine and 70 in Bassett after dedicating 92 trees on May 17 that were planted last fall at Summit Lake State Recreation Area near Tekamah.
The first 60 Memorial Forest trees were planted in 2020 at Omaha’s Levi-Carter Park, and similar sized forests are now located in 15 other communities, from the Horning State Farm Demonstration Forest near Plattsmouth to along old Highway 2 that through south Lincoln.
Conversations, Meier said, are underway to plant new forests of at least 50 trees each in communities from Falls City to Scottsbluff and Beatrice to Aurora.
The group hopes to plant 1,500 new trees this year, and complete the project by 2030.
Meier said there’s a lot of analogies between military service and a grove of trees.
Trees were chosen and assigned to a plot of land — as are soldiers — he said, and while each tree is unique, there are many species and types that become stronger when working together as a grove or military unit.
Because there is no official data base of “fallen heroes,” he said the Memorial Forest group is always learning about someone new. They are added to the list, Meier said.
Each tree, typically six-feet-tall and of several, native varieties, costs about $300 each, money raised through donations or sponsorships.
For instance, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission donated and planted the trees at Summit Lake, with the help of contributions by Tekamah native Ron Carson and his wife Jeanie. The Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District planted and will care for the trees at Valentine and Bassett.
Each tree is named for a military member, first responder or law enforcement officer who died while serving or from causes directly related from having served. Thus soldiers who died from exposure to Agent Orange or burn pits in Iraq are eligible.
Signage near the groves of trees features a QR code so that people can access a website that lists the location of each tree and the person associated with it, along with stories based on available information about them.
Eligibility extends back to the Spanish-American War of 1898.
Meier said he hopes the groves prove educational for those who visit the trees, as well as providing comfort for families and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”










There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges.

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Bliss in El Paso, Texas on Armed Forces Day was an important occasion. Veterans Day and Memorial Day were revered in a city where the military presence was strong. Recent politicians have called for replacing these solemn occasions with holidays celebrating American victories in World War I and World War II. To do that would be to undermine what makes the Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day special.
This is not to knock America’s performance in both world wars. It was impressive what Americans were able to accomplish.  In fact, I’ve written columns about our victories in these conflicts. I was even criticized by some readers for my verbal attacks on Nazis for their killing of U.S. P.O.W.s and pretending to surrender in order to kill more G.I.s (I was accused of spreading “propaganda.”  I’ve written how we should honor American generals, not praise Nazi Generals.
But Armed Forces Day is about honoring all active-duty military. Veterans Day is for recognizing the living veterans who served this country. And Memorial Day is about commemorating those who gave their lives in defense of this country.
Making May 8 “Victory Day for World War II” completely ignores those who still had plenty of fighting in the Pacific. I would recommend the politician who suggested it should study the Battle of Okinawa, and see what our U.S. Marines and Army accomplished in that fight, which lasted until June 22. That politician should watch “Hacksaw Ridge,” and learn what happened to the sailors who suffered from a massive Kamikaze attack, as well as the pilots who took on the massive Japanese battleship Yamato. All in all, 12,000 Americans and General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. died, while another 36,000 suffered wounds. There’s no word on how many were afflicted with terrible memories of that conflict, which did not conclude until well after V-E Day.
To replace Veterans Day with “Victory Day” set off a colleague of mine, a veteran who earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star in Vietnam. “So how about a day for Korea?” he texted me. “Guess, technically that one isn’t over. Panama? Invasion but not really a war. But didn’t we win in Panama? Shouldn’t we celebrate that? Desert Storm? Wasn’t that a win? What else? Maybe we could….have a big military parade on every one of them? Isn’t that how you’re supposed to celebrate a victory?”
He wasn’t done, by a long shot. “And since it’s all about wins now and not really about honoring veterans, no more uncomfortable visits to cemeteries and VA hospitals? Wars are or should be last resort solutions to perceived problems. We had it right. Focus on the people who have served our country, often at great risk and sacrifice, by individuals, including sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. Why can’t we just continue to recognize that? People who only think in terms of wins and losses should stick to football and leave the analysis of a war to adults who have a clue of what war is like and what it does to people and to a country. But that kind of history makes some people uncomfortable and heaven forbid that anyone should ever have to be uncomfortable and have to think about anything that might upset them.”
He continued in perhaps the longest text I have ever received. “You know, I have a bias when it comes to war. Having known and having had serious conversations about serious things with friends whose names are now inscribed on a wall up in D.C. probably does that.”
For those who still serve, served in the past, and those who paid the ultimate price, let’s preserve Armed Forces Day, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day instead of changing these for political purposes. It’s the least we can do for them.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images) Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516, and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange.

More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. 
The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. 
These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.

After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”

While their friends are cannonballing into the city pool this weekend, my sons will spend the day in an Eastern Kentucky cemetery, placing flowers on the graves of relatives they never knew.
We are going back home on Decoration Day — a folk tradition practiced by generations of Appalachians and Southerners dedicated to visiting cemeteries where their families are buried to clean and decorate their graves, and often to attend a religious service and dinner on the cemetery grounds.
Like most who grew up in Eastern Kentucky, I’ve been practicing various rites of Decoration Day all my life. I loved the reunions, playing with my cousins, and filling plates of food and desserts. Although, I admit: I have often seen the other parts of Decoration Day as an unnecessary effort, one I had little interest in carrying on. What good was there in spending money on artificial flowers for people who would never know you made the gesture?
Yet this year, something changed. Perhaps it was turning 40, or the reckoning of the pandemic, or both, that made Decoration Day seem urgent and important not only to observe, but to pass down to my children.
As my perspective changed, my interest grew and sent me seeking answers, both historical and personal, about the cultural tradition, its origins, and why I felt a sudden urge to drag my three children to a cemetery on their first week of summer vacation.
 What Is Decoration Day?

In Ohio, the streets of my small town are lined with tiny American flags. Living near a military base, with many active-duty and retired U.S. Air Force neighbors, I am keenly aware of the reverence paid to Memorial Day. Each year, I’d find myself asking my friends, “We always called it Decoration Day. We decorated everyone’s graves. Did you?” The answer was, with rare exception, no. Secretly, I worried if somehow I had incorrectly celebrated a patriotic holiday. Was this the same as not knowing I needed to illuminate a flag at night or take it down in the rain? Did we get this wrong? Had we expanded it selfishly to include everyone when we should have been only honoring those who died in battle?
For insight, I turned to the book “Decoration Day in the Mountains,” by folklorist Alan Jabbour, founding director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.
Jabbour’s thorough exploration of Decoration Day relieved me of my concerns and filled me with a new appreciation for history and rituals.

Decoration Day, Jabbour wrote, actually inspired Memorial Day, pre-dating any post-Civil War celebration in the South or North. Before the war, Appalachians and Southerners were already practicing what they called Decoration Day, also called “a decoration,”  which involved an annual “cleaning of community cemeteries, decorating them with flowers, and holding a religious service in the cemetery, often with “dinner on the ground.” Families spent weeks leading up to Decoration Day making buds and petals from bright crepe paper, cleaning the cemeteries.
His research also softened my other silent concern that Decoration Day was tied up in celebrating the Confederacy. Jabbour explains that two early and unrelated celebrations of the Confederate dead — one in Charleston, South Carolina, and the other in Petersburg, Virginia — both using the word “decoration” and both using flowers, led Jabbour to the conclude that organizers of the events each drew upon an existing tradition.
After reading Jabbour’s book, I called my grandmother, with whom I had tagged along to the cemetery, reunions and flower-buying expeditions. It was she who had carried the duty of Decoration Day to me, and I wanted to know why.
 ‘I was kindly like your youngins‘

One question from me about Decoration Day transports my grandmother back to her childhood — and ties me to the generations that came before me.
“Can you tell me what you remember about Decoration Day?”
From the old days?
“Yes.”





It used to be a big day for people. When I was a little girl, my grandma would start in her spare time … and make crepe paper flowers. She usually made them out of bright red and turquoise and bright pink and white crepe paper. They would make a bud, and cut out petals, and take a knife to the petal and scrape the end of it to make it lay down and curl. They would have their wire, and put that bud on the end of the wire, and start with the little petals and tie them on.
It was about two-and-a-half  miles to that cemetery. Grandpa would always walk, and grandma would be on the horse. She would have a basket full of fried chicken, maybe fried pies, and cake, just food like that. And me, I was always running. We cut through the hills instead of going on the main road … we’d come down so far out of that hollow and then cut through the hill. When you go through the hills there’s wild honeysuckle, the prettiest orange, and as you go up through there, there are pine trees … and it smells like pine all the way through there. It was where grandma’s babies were buried, ones who died when they were born, and her son who died when he was 21.
They’d sing, decorate graves, and talk, a lot of them hadn’t seen each other in a month or a few weeks.
They had a preacher; he always, at least to me, preached too long. I would get so hot and tired that I just wanted to hurry up and get gone. …
I’ll be honest with you, I was kindly like your youngins, I never was still.  As far as standing around and watching what everybody did, I just sure didn’t. But I do remember decorating the graves. I think it’s important to decorate.			


Hearing her stories made it clear: Decoration Day, for me, was the remembering, linking myself and my children to the generations before us.
As I grow older, and as a pandemic has brought the fragility of life into clear focus, I’m buoyed by the remembering, by the traditions that connect the present, future and past. To quote Alan Jabbour, “At the deepest spiritual level, a decoration is an act of respect for the dead that reaffirms one’s bonds with those who have gone before.”
And so today, my children will carry the flowers over the hillside to the graves of their great-grandfather, great-great grandparents and other relatives.
We’ll make sure to place a small bouquet on the stone of my grandfather’s little brother, who died as an infant.
They’ll listen to our stories as we walk around the cemetery, and I hope, feel connected to the people who came before them.
They will get hot, tired, and bored.
Like their great-grandmother 80 years before them, they will want us to hurry up and get gone.
But someday, maybe they will want to come back.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)When I began teaching courses on homelessness and poverty at Gettysburg College more than 20 years ago, I regularly noted to my students that I often found common cause with a wide range of people from across the political spectrum when it came to seeking solutions and providing services for homeless veterans.
While some people certainly still make the right noises in this regard, the current obsession with wiping the slate of the federal government clean and starting from scratch now is putting many veterans at-risk.
Homelessness is a tragedy that affects far too many Americans, and the reality is that“[h]omelessness remains more common among veterans compared to non-veterans.” Veterans are especially vulnerable to a number of risk factors related to homelessness, including substance abuse, PTSD, mental health issues, low income, and economic instability.
Unfortunately, veterans who fall into homelessness are also particularly prone to remaining unhoused, as research indicates that, “98% of homeless veterans have a chronic pattern of homelessness.” As the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs notes in this regard: “For some, taking off the uniform and acclimating to a non-military life comes with social challenges and can ultimately lead to hard times, such as being homeless. U.S. military veterans are estimated to make up a large portion – 11 percent – of homeless adults.”
Although PTSD and related disorders certainly loom large amongst the risk factors for veteran homelessness, it is important to keep in mind that the number one reason for homelessness in America today is actually the lack of affordable housing. As reported in the Independent in its recent coverage of Elon Musk’s baseless claim that “the word ‘homeless’ is a ‘lie’ and ‘a propaganda word,’” the reality in the United States today is that “[t]he primary driver of homelessness, particularly among families, is a lack of stable affordable housing, with evictions, overcrowded housing, domestic violence and job losses sending homeless families into shelters and onto the streets.”
Currently, the curtailing of rental assistance seems poised to tip tens of thousands more Americans out of housing. Experts suggest that many of us are more vulnerable to such risks than we’d like to imagine, and veterans are especially so. Given this reality, it is particularly alarming that under the Trump Administration, the VA recently “has ended a new mortgage-rescue program that so far has helped about 20,000 veterans avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.”
As did the Obama Administration before him, Trump has claimed that he will end veteran homelessness. It is only fair to note that the Obama Administration had some successes in striving towards that goal. In this current environment, however, it is difficult to reconcile Trump’s rhetoric in this regard with sweeping executive actions demolishing some of the key federal players in this effort. To cite one staggering recent example, “[t]he US Interagency Council on Homelessness, which helps coordinate federal housing aid to cities, was targeted for elimination by a Trump executive order in March.” Moreover, according to the New York Times, the president seeks to end permanent supportive housing for an estimated 300,000 people considered chronically homeless. Many are veterans.
Veterans are more vulnerable than the general population to the sweeping demolishment of the federal government. This is not simply because the “Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut 83,000 jobs, slashing employment by over 17% at the federal agency that provides health care for millions of veterans” It is also in part because “nearly 30% of federal workers are veterans, half of whom are disabled. This means that veterans, who make up 6.1% of the U.S. population, are disproportionately affected by federal worker cuts.”
Because the vast bulk of the VA workforce provides veteran healthcare, “cuts to VA workers mean cuts to health care.” Since veterans as a group rely so heavily on Medicaid, cuts to that program disproportionately disadvantage veterans. Furthermore, because “[w]orking-age veterans face an elevated risk of experiencing food insecurity compared to their nonveteran peers,” cuts to food assistance programs also hit veterans harder than other groups.
  The Iron Mike statue overlooks the La Fiere bridge in Normandy, France. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).
The news is not all bad, and in our own region in Pennsylvania, efforts to help house homeless Vets have been laudable and even inspiring. For example, a tiny home project for veterans experiencing homelessness opened last year in Harrisburg. In addition, the commonwealth offers VETConnect Services, and there are a number of local private organizations dedicated to helping veterans at risk of homelessness. This includes a dedicated veteran aspect of the 211 program, which allows those in need of services to dial 211 to find help.
In the end, though, only on the national level can we find the resources to coordinate efforts and to tackle challenges on this scale. In any case, it is only reasonable to expect the federal government that recruited and ordered these veterans into harm’s way to take the lead in seeking to offer them whatever services they need.
I am a Pennsylvania Quaker, a member of the pacifist religious organization that founded this Commonwealth. Quakers do not embrace military service, to be sure, but we do embrace ideals of honor, service, and integrity, and we believe strongly in honoring social contracts.
If someone feels moved by their conscience to perform military service and is true to their ideals, I do not condemn that person. Indeed, many such folks number amongst my closest friends, and even some of my family members. I believe that those who serve this country selflessly in any capacity deserve recognition and support for doing so, and not merely in terms of lip service.
If a veteran’s military experience results in the need for special accommodations, medical care, drug or alcohol rehabilitation, housing assistance, or similar services, I think that we should take special care to meet such needs.
My own father, a proud veteran of the U.S. Army, died homeless in 1988. He was a chronic alcoholic and estranged from his family, so I am sure that there are those out there who will claim that he brought his fate upon himself. I have always maintained, however, that we can do better as a nation, and that civilized people care for the most vulnerable amongst the population without regard to blame or shame.
I have spent much of my adult life trying my best to live this truth, through regular active service in my community, through educational opportunities for my students, and through leadership roles on boards and within service organizations.
Veterans Day was established to remember those who have fallen in defense of this country. Let us also remember on that day those who have served with honor but have fallen on hard times.

By most common measures, the life of Adriana Smith ended three months ago, when a tragic series of undiagnosed blood clots left her brain dead, with no hope of recovery. Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances and deal with none of its consequences.
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control until the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution.
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.

  Sen. Ed Setzler (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-26 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT child tax credit still possible as budget talks hit home stretch,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/26/ct-budget-child-tax-credit/,"Democratic leaders are cautiously optimistic about one popular tax-cutting idea: A $150-per-child tax credit, up to $450 per household.","State legislators are focused mainly on spending now, trimming their requests to compromise soon with Gov. Ned Lamont on a new two-year budget.
But with just over one week left in the 2025 session, one popular tax-cutting idea is still alive: a new credit for low- and middle-income households with children.
Leaders of the Senate and House Democratic majorities were cautiously optimistic about the child tax credit, though the full program likely would need to be phased in over several years.
The initial $150 per child income tax break under consideration would cost state government $83 million per year, even as looming federal Medicaid cuts could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions in annual revenue. But given the unprecedented surpluses the state has amassed since 2017 and the extremely conservative revenue growth the Lamont administration has projected during its six years, lawmakers say Connecticut can afford this relief.
“We are trying very hard to protect that tax credit the best that we can,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
“It still is a reasonable objective,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who said working families here needed more relief long before President Donald J. Trump and Congress began planning huge cutbacks in Medicaid, food stamps and other social assistance programs.
“The pressures [on working families] are going to be extreme, and we hear all the time about the potential Draconian, punitive choices” federal cutbacks will force upon them, Looney added.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that tax proposals remain part of ongoing budget negotiations among the administration and legislative leaders. The governor proposed boosting a different state income tax credit, one that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills, from $300 to $350, while also broadening eligibility. 
Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based personal income tax that doesn’t account for the cost of raising children. Many Democratic lawmakers here largely have endorsed offering a $600-per-dependent credit with relief capped at $1,800 per household.
But because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding, the General Assembly’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee endorsed a less costly $150-per-child credit starting with 2025 earnings and tax returns filed in the spring of 2026, with a maximum household benefit of $450.
It would be available to single parents earning up to $100,000 per year and couples earning up to $200,000, starting with 2026 earnings.
The credit would be gradually phased out above those income levels. For every $1,000 earned above those thresholds, households would lose 10% of the credit’s value.
The credit also would be refundable. Even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to reduce via the credit, it still would have $150 per child added to its refund.
Nonpartisan analysts project this tax break would cost government about $83 million per year, about the same as Lamont’s plan to expand the property tax credit. It’s also roughly one-quarter of what legislators anticipate the state would lose with a full $600-per-child benefit.
And while the finance committee measure wouldn’t order increases in the credit in future years, many supporters say proposals to increase the credit would enjoy strong backing down the road.
Rep. Jillian Gilchest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and another backer of the $600-per-child benefit, predicted most Democrats won’t be satisfied for long with “an austere child tax credit” given likely federal cutbacks in health and human service programs. 
“More people are going to feel the pain of these [federal] budget decisions,” she said.
Reformers have been clamoring for a child credit in recent years as public and private analyses show Connecticut’s state and municipal tax systems, combined, disproportionately burden the poor and middle class.
The Department of Revenue Services’ 2024 report found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and two-and-a-half times the statewide average.
Even one of the largest state tax cuts in 2023, which included the first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, only slowed — but didn’t reverse — the ever-widening shift onto working families, according to a 2024 analysis from Connecticut Voices for Children, a progressive New Haven-based policy group.
The United Way of Connecticut, one of the progressive groups spearheading this year’s push for a child tax credit, released a report last October showing that a family of four — two parents and two children — needed to earn $113,520 in 2022 in this state to cover a basic “survival budget.”
The United Way’s methodology covers housing, food, utilities, transportation, child care and — assuming the family can’t afford a computer — at least one smart phone. By comparison, the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet, said a family of four earning more than $27,750 in 2022 was above the poverty line.
“On a good day, 42% of Connecticut families with children struggle to make ends meet,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter. “The proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will hit many Connecticut families hard. And ongoing economic upheaval and rising prices affect every family in our state. Creating a Connecticut child tax credit has never been more important.”
CT has underestimated tax revenues by wide margins
Legislators also were optimistic that Connecticut could afford to provide a child tax credit, even given the uncertainty of federal funding, given its budget caps and its track record of projecting revenues since Lamont took office in 2019.
These caps have generated surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, an amount equal to 8% of the General Fund, since they last were set in 2017. The administration is projecting a $2.4 billion surplus this year, equal to 10%. Analysts project budget caps will capture at least about $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
Connecticut has funneled $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017 to build reserves and scale back pension debt, a furious pace that far outstrips any similar effort in modern history. 
Critics say the state has overcompensated for fiscal mistakes of prior decades and is saving excessively now at the expense of core programs and tax relief for the poor and middle class.
The state also has been extremely conservative in its revenue projections in recent years.
Legislators largely build the budget each year using an April 30 forecast prepared by their nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis and by the governor’s budget staff. The basis for that forecast is income and other tax data provided by the administration, particularly the Department of Revenue Services.
Connecticut has amassed large surpluses in each of Lamont’s six years in office. Most of those surpluses turned out to be significantly larger than projected on April 30. The state’s fiscal year ends June 30, and the comptroller formally closes the books in late September.
Since Lamont has been governor, the actual surplus has topped the April 30 projection by an average of $600 million per year.
But 2020 and 2021 were outliers. The coronavirus led officials to push the 2020 income tax filing deadline back from Apil 15 to July 15. And in 2021 they moved it to May 15. In both cases, that meant analysts had limited data to build their projections.
But even if those two fiscal years are removed, the average increase in surplus after the April 30 projection has been $375 million.
“I believe it’s realistic to continue to talk about a phase-in” of a larger child tax credit, Looney said, noting that the average surplus in recent years far exceeds the cost of helping working families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nunez-Speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

Today is Memorial Day – the day on which we honor the memory of the servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
All caring and thinking people should take at least a moment today to lift up these heroes.
And today would also be a good one to help assure that the government supports the heroes who are still with us.
And sadly, the need here is great.
As recent news reports have recounted in painful detail, Trump administration budget cuts are decimating the already understaffed and underfunded Veterans Administration and VA hospitals. More than 80,000 employees are being fired and that’s sure to wreak havoc with the services upon which millions of military veterans depend.
At a Voices for Veterans event in Fayetteville last week, several vets blasted the cuts as cruel, shortsighted, and sure to cause enormous pain and suffering.
The bottom line: Memorial Day is about remembering those we’ve lost – that’s for sure – but we also honor their sacrifice by doing everything in our power to spare living veterans from an early grave.

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.

CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
Cave City pushes forward
Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark., Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Photo by Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
FEMA politics
Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.

Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.

Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.

Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process, and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
House and Senate pass bills to remove income limits on EFA program

Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.
In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes, and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Earlier this month, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program as part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(JackF/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Republican lawmakers have been battling over a bill that includes massive tax and spending cuts. Much of their disagreement has been over provisions intended to reduce the cost of Medicaid.
The popular health insurance program, which is funded by both the federal and state governments, covers about 78.5 million low-income and disabled people — more than 1 in 5 Americans.
On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives narrowly approved the tax, spending and immigration bill. The legislation, which passed without any support from Democrats, is designed to reduce federal Medicaid spending by requiring anyone enrolled in the program who appears to be able to get a job to either satisfy work requirements or lose their coverage. It’s still unclear, however, whether Senate Republicans would support that provision.
Although there are few precedents for such a mandate for Medicaid, other safety net programs have been enforcing similar rules for nearly three decades. I’m a political scientist who has extensively studied the work requirements of another safety net program: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
As I explain in my book, “Living Off the Government? Race, Gender, and the Politics of Welfare,” work requirements place extra burdens on low-income families but do little to lift them out of poverty.
 
Work requirements for TANF
TANF gives families with very low incomes some cash they can spend on housing, food, clothing or whatever they need most. The Clinton administration launched it as a replacement for a similar program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, in 1996. At the time, both political parties were eager to end a welfare system they believed was riddled with abuse. A big goal with TANF was ending the dependence of people getting cash benefits on the government by moving them from welfare to work.
Many people were removed from the welfare rolls, but not because work requirements led to economic prosperity. Instead, they had trouble navigating the bureaucratic demands.
TANF is administered by the states. They can set many rules of their own, but they must comply with an important federal requirement: Adult recipients have to work or engage in an authorized alternative activity for at least 30 hours per week. The number of weekly hours is only 20 if the recipient is caring for a child under the age of 6.
The dozen activities or so that can count toward this quota range from participating in job training programs to engaging in community service.
Some adults enrolled in TANF are exempt from work requirements, depending on their state’s own policies. The most common exemptions are for people who are ill, have a disability or are over age 60.
To qualify for TANF, families must have dependent children; in some states pregnant women also qualify. Income limits are set by the state and range from US$307 a month for a family of three in Alabama to $2,935 a month for a family of three in Minnesota.
Adult TANF recipients face a federal five-year lifetime limit on benefits. States can adopt shorter time limits; Arizona’s is 12 months.
 
An administrative burden
Complying with these work requirements generally means proving that you’re working or making the case that you should be exempt from this mandate. This places what’s known as an “administrative burden” on the people who get cash assistance. It often requires lots of documentation and time. If you have an unpredictable work schedule, inconsistent access to child care or obligations to care for an older relative, this paperwork is hard to deal with.
What counts as work, how many hours must be completed and who is exempt from these requirements often comes down to a caseworker’s discretion. Social science research shows that this discretion is not equally applied and is often informed by stereotypes.
The number of people getting cash assistance has fallen sharply since TANF replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children. In some states caseloads have dropped by more than 50% despite significant population growth.
Some of this decline happened because recipients got jobs that paid them too much to qualify. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office that provides economic research to Congress, attributes, at least in part, an increase in employment among less-educated single mothers in the 1990s to work requirements.
Not everyone who stopped getting cash benefits through TANF wound up employed, however. Other recipients who did not meet requirements fell into deep poverty.
Regardless of why people leave the program, when fewer low-income Americans get TANF benefits, the government spends less money on cash assistance. Federal funding has remained flat at $16.5 billion since 1996. Taking inflation into account, the program receives half as much funding as when it was created. In addition, states have used the flexibility granted them to direct most of their TANF funds to priorities other than cash benefits, such as pre-K education.
Many Americans who get help paying for groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are also subject to work requirements. People the government calls “able-bodied adults without dependents” can only receive SNAP benefits for three months within a three-year period if they are not employed.
 
A failed experiment in Arkansas
Lawmakers in Congress and in statehouses have debated whether to add work requirements for Medicaid before. More than a dozen states have applied for waivers that would let them give it a try.
When Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, during the first Trump administration, it was largely seen as a failure. Some 18,000 people lost their health care coverage, but employment rates did not increase.
After a court order stopped the policy in 2019, most people regained their coverage.
Georgia is currently the only state with Medicaid work requirements in effect, after implementing a waiver in July 2023. The program has experienced technical difficulties and has had trouble verifying work activities.
Other states, including Idaho, Indiana and Kentucky, are already asking the federal government to let them enforce Medicaid work requirements.

The phenomenon is sometimes known as the “Proust Effect,” for a scene from Marcel Proust’s novel “Remembrance of Things Past,” when a character’s childhood memories come flooding back, triggered by the scent of a sweet cake called a madeleine.
For me it’s lilacs. Every Memorial Day of my childhood my mother would cut lilacs from the big bush near the back porch of our home in Grand Island. She would bunch them into bouquets and then send my sister and me in search of vases and mason jars to fill with water. 
On the trip to the cemetery in the back seat, my sister and I would hold tight to the lilacs and whatever else mom culled from our yard or that of a generous neighbor. Mom would manage my father’s driving to keep the sloshing to a minimum.
  Rich Gillham is shown a couple years before he died. (Submitted photo)
The car was thick with the unmistakable fragrance of lilacs, an aroma now permanently linked in my memory to Memorial Day. And, sadly, more.
The lilac bush was large enough that anyone passing by on the sidewalk enjoyed the scent.
Rich Gillham knew the smell.
He was two grades ahead of me in school and six blocks to the north of me on Kimball Street, but a childhood friend nonetheless, the way neighborhood friends know each other.
He would pedal by on his bicycle and then, as a teen he would zoom past on his motorcycle — sometimes stopping because he had me on the back hitching a ride home from football practice.
There was an uncluttered ease to Rich, a confidence that this 15-year-old, saddled with a high school sophomore’s lack of self-assurance and no driver’s license, admired.
My parents didn’t want me riding on a motorcycle, but they knew Rich and his parents, Gerald and Ursula, the way neighborhood parents know each other.
Rich never came by as an adult.
He was killed in a place called Dinh Tuong Province, thousands of miles from Kimball Street and the smell of lilacs. He was 20.
I’m not sure I’ll remember Rich more this Memorial Day than I do any other day. With war now a modern constant and young men and women from their own streets and neighborhoods in places we call harm’s way, he is more on my mind.
I paid my respects to Rich and others when the traveling wall made it to our hometown, where I was overcome with many emotions, not the least of which was the rushing back of a shared and gentle childhood.
War being what it is, we’re never far from paying respects and decorating graves and realizing the true and somber meaning of Memorial Day.
Vietnam was my generation’s war. Rich was my neighbor and friend who died there, whose life and death touched many, especially those of us from Kimball Street.
We played as kids. Our families shared dinners. Our parents laughed over beers.
In high school, Rich played football his senior year, never getting in a game, but sticking it out nonetheless. And he was always willing to throw me on the back of his little two-wheeler and take me home.
My best last memory of Rich was of him astride his new, powerful Triumph motorcycle, so loud a conversation next to it was impossible.
A group of us were parked at Nifty’s Drive-In on South Locust Street when we heard him coming on the Triumph, a growling, snarling monster in faded copper.
We were taken with the clamor and power … and Rich, nonchalant and indifferent to the stares from the curious, the impressed and the disgusted.
He turned it off for a few minutes for a little back and forth chatter, then stomped the Triumph a few times to bring it back to life. He sped off in a cloud of youth and noise.
We made a point to see how far he would get before we could no longer hear him. It was long after he drove out of sight, much to our delight and admiration.
Delight and admiration. That’s how I remember my neighbor, the first casualty of war from my childhood.
Come to think of it, delight and admiration could fit millions of memories on Memorial Day.
And maybe throw in the scent of lilacs, too.

When people picture families in need of support, they often think of new parents juggling diapers and daycare. And yes, those were challenging years. But the truth is, the financial stress doesn’t end when your child starts school. It changes and, in many ways, it gets even harder.
I’m the mother of two middle school boys. They’re funny, thoughtful, energetic, and I’m incredibly proud of the young men they’re becoming. But as they’ve grown, so have the costs of raising them. Like many parents across Connecticut, my family works hard and budgets carefully, but we are living in a time of economic strain. Every trip to the grocery store costs more than the last, and electricity rates are sky high.  
In this time of rising expenses, Connecticut—already one of the most expensive states in the country to live—remains the only state that taxes personal income without adjusting for family size. This includes all of our neighboring states. That means a single adult with no dependents pays the same rate as my family with two kids. It’s an outdated system that doesn’t reflect the cost of raising a family. 
That’s why I strongly support creating a fully refundable Connecticut Child Tax Credit. I’ll be honest — it won’t solve everything, but it will make a meaningful difference. 
This is a common-sense policy that would benefit more than 550,000 kids of all ages across our state until they reach the age of 17. It’s a practical, proven, and bipartisan solution. It’s time to make it real. 
Families across Connecticut are being asked to do more with less, and we simply can’t afford to wait any longer.

One such victim was our beloved son, Alec Pelletier, who died from fentanyl poisoning in 2018 while living in a sober home in Canaan.
Alec struggled with bipolar disorder and SUD for seven years. He was a sensitive, intelligent, funny young man, and a loving brother to his three siblings. In the end, Alec was fully engaged in recovery and looked forward to a spiritually fulfilling life of sobriety, empowered by the love of his family and friends. 

Dita Bhargava
The real tragedy of our family’s loss is how many others have been affected by the addiction crisis. More than 7,000 people in CT have suffered fatal overdoses since Alec’s passing. Connecticut residents are more likely to die from unintentional drug overdoses than from motor vehicle crashes. Many of these lives, including Alec’s, could have been saved if they had access to a safe place where an overdose could be reversed.
Victims of a broken system
Like many innocent people, Alec, a AAA hockey player, fell victim to easily accessible and highly addictive painkillers in his early teens. 
Big pharmaceutical companies misrepresented the addictive nature of these opioids. At the same time, FDA and government leaders failed to act promptly as the addiction crisis spread rapidly through communities. Then, foreign countries compounded the addiction crisis by flooding our nation with poisonous fentanyl, which ultimately took Alec’s life and is responsible for over 80% of overdoses in Connecticut. 
Congress was too slow to act. Our children deserved protection from the deceptive greed of big pharma and drug cartels.
Better standards of care in treatment facilities and sober homes is critical.  A few weeks before Alec overdosed, he was discharged from a treatment center in Kent, without being put on the only known evidenced-based protocol – Medically Assisted Treatment, and was referred to a home meant for people who had been sober for a year, even though Alec was only sober for three months.
 Overdose prevention centers will keep people alive
S.B. 7, also known as An Act Concerning Protections For Access To Health Care And The Equitable Delivery Of Health Care Services In The State, would allow for establishing safe, non-judgmental centers in Connecticut that provide a space where individuals struggling with SUD can have an overdose reversed and their lives saved. 
While opponents argue that OPCs enable drug use and pollute communities with crime and homelessness, decades of robust research demonstrate an association with reduced morbidity, mortality, and transmission of infectious diseases, improved individual health outcomes and services engagement, and cost-effectiveness. The FDA’s decision to make Naloxone available over the counter reflects a growing recognition of the efficacy of harm-reduction strategies. 
The widespread availability of Naloxone has played a pivotal role in decreasing overdose rates – OPCs are essentially an extension of Narcan distribution. OPCs also promote cleaner environments by keeping drug paraphernalia like syringes off the streets and keeping people from using them in the open public.
The Opposite of Addiction Is Connection
In six simple words, journalist Johann Hari summarized the profound importance of community and connection for those suffering from SUD. Co-existing disorders, such as mental health illnesses, often accompany addiction. Loneliness can lead to depression, anxiety, and other health problems.
Last summer, I was privileged to visit several overdose prevention centers in Canada, where they have operated for over two decades. The centers exude compassion, understanding, and love. Clients feel welcomed, valued, and connected.
According to reports, between 2017 and June 2023, over 49,000 overdoses and drug-related emergencies were attended to at these Canadian sites, with no recorded fatalities. Beyond emergency care, OPCs offer comprehensive resources, including addiction treatment, harm reduction services, health education, and necessities like food, water, and toiletries. Successful models also operate in neighboring states, New York and Rhode Island, where thousands of lives have been saved. Vermont and Minnesota are advancing similar initiatives.
The night Alec passed, on July 13, 2018, was especially devastating because Alec had been doing so well, giving us hope for his future. It was his 26th birthday, and we had discussed celebrating together just days earlier. However, addiction is a chronic disease with high relapse rates, and on that night, Alec succumbed to his cravings. His tolerance to opiates had diminished due to months of sobriety, making him especially vulnerable. 
Alec was aware of the dangers of fentanyl lacing and carefully placed a package of Narcan by his bedside in case of an overdose, but ashamed of relapse he decided to use alone. Young men right outside his sober homeroom were unaware Alec was in trouble. What good is Narcan if no one administers it? If Alec had connected to a safe, unbiased place in his moment of despair, where a healthcare provider could have given Naloxone, he would be here today.
The call for bold leadership
At a recent Hearing, State Sen. Heather Somers urged that the overdose epidemic not be labeled a public health crisis so that residents don’t bombard the Connecticut Department of Public Health for better solutions. 
Over the last two decades, over a million Americans, including thousands in Connecticut have vanished like Alec – children, siblings, friends, colleagues, and parents, because our society has failed to protect them. Overdose rates have increased in Connecticut by over 250% from 2014 to 2024. This is a public health crisis of epic scale, and we cannot shy away from that fact. 
Somers is also unduly concerned that OPCs are not a bridge to recovery. A study on an OPC in Vancouver showed a 30% increase in detoxification services uptake within a year. In another study, 42% of OPC participants not in treatment at baseline enrolled within 24 months
Gov. Ned Lamont once asked me what more we can do to address the overdose crisis in our state. Governor, act boldly and responsibly to help the vulnerable find life, recovery and hope. Please pass S.B. 7.

George Floyd’s death is a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Furthermore, in 2025, 67% of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65% felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’
Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.

Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

‘The possibility that lies ahead’
Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”

‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’
Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’
While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’
In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it.

It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again.
She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right.
“Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died.
Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples.
For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer.
In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, 8-year-old Virginia and 6-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.

 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy.
In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather: A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

Kelly for KFF Health News)HENRICO, Virginia — Sheldon Ekirch spends a lot of time on hold with her health insurance company.
Sometimes, as the minutes tick by and her frustration mounts, Ekirch, 30, opens a meditation app on her phone. It was recommended by her psychologist to help with the depression associated with a stressful and painful medical disorder.
In 2023, Ekirch was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy, a condition that makes her limbs and muscles feel as if they’re on fire. Now she takes more than a dozen prescriptions to manage chronic pain and other symptoms, including insomnia.
“I don’t feel like I am the person I was a year-and-a-half ago,” said Ekirch, who was on the cusp of launching her law career, before getting sick. “Like, my body isn’t my own.”
Ekirch said specialists have suggested that a series of infusions made from blood plasma called intravenous immunoglobulin — IVIG, for short — could ease, or potentially eradicate, her near-constant pain. But Ekirch’s insurance company has repeatedly denied coverage for the treatment, according to documents provided by the patient.
Patients with Ekirch’s condition don’t always respond to IVIG, but she said she deserves to try it, even though it could cost more than $100,000.
“I’m paying a lot of money for health insurance,” said Ekirch, who pays more than $600 a month in premiums. “I don’t understand why they won’t help me, why my life means so little to them.”
For patient advocates and health economists, cases like Ekirch’s illustrate why prior authorization has become such a chronic pain point for patients and doctors. For 50 years, insurers have employed prior authorization, they say, to reduce wasteful health care spending, prevent unnecessary treatment, and guard against potential harm.
The practice differs by insurance company and plan, but the rules often require patients or their doctors to request permission from the patient’s health insurance company before proceeding with a drug, treatment, or medical procedure.
The insurance industry provides little information about how often prior authorization is used. Transparency requirements established by the federal government to shed light on the use of prior authorization by private insurers haven’t been broadly enforced, said Justin Lo, a senior researcher for the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Yet it’s widely acknowledged that prior authorization tends to disproportionately impact some of the sickest people who need the most expensive care. And despite bipartisan support to reform the system, as well as recent attempts by health insurance companies to ease the burden for patients and doctors, some tactics have met skepticism.
Some insurers’ efforts to improve prior authorization practices aren’t as helpful as they would seem, said Judson Ivy, CEO of Ensemble Health Partners, a revenue cycle management company.
“When you really dive deep,” he said, these improvements don’t seem to touch the services and procedures, such as CT scans, that get caught up in prior authorization so frequently. “When we started looking into it,” he said, “it was almost a PR stunt.”
 
  The ‘Tipping Point’ 

When Arman Shahriar’s father was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2023, his father’s oncologist ordered a whole-body PET scan to determine the cancer’s stage. The scan was denied by a company called EviCore by Evernorth, a Cigna subsidiary that makes prior authorization decisions.
Shahriar, an internal medicine resident, said he spent hours on the phone with his father’s insurer, arguing that the latest medical guidelines supported the scan. The imaging request was eventually approved. But his father’s scan was delayed several weeks — and multiple appointments were scheduled, then canceled during the time-consuming process — while the family feared the cancer would continue to spread.
EviCore by Evernorth spokesperson Madeline Ziomek wrote in an emailed statement that incomplete clinical information provided by physicians is a leading cause of such denials. The company is “actively developing new ways to make the submission process simpler and faster for physicians,” Ziomek said.
In the meantime, Shahriar, who often struggles to navigate prior authorization for his patients, accused the confusing system of “artificially creating problems in people’s lives” at the wrong time.
“If families with physicians are struggling through this, how do other people navigate it? And the short answer is, they can’t,” said Shahriar, who wrote about his father’s case in an essay published last year by JAMA Oncology. “We’re kind of reaching a tipping point where we’re realizing, collectively, something needs to be done.”
The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City sidewalk in December prompted an outpouring of grief among those who knew him, but it also became a platform for public outrage about the methods insurance companies use to deny treatment.
An Emerson College poll conducted in mid-December found 41% of 18- to 29-year-olds thought the actions of Thompson’s killer were at least somewhat acceptable. In a NORC survey from the University of Chicago conducted in December, two-thirds of respondents indicated that insurance company profits, and their denials for health care coverage, contributed “a great deal/moderate amount” to the killing. Instagram accounts established in support of Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old Maryland suspect accused of murder and terrorism, have attracted thousands of followers.
“The past several weeks have further challenged us to even more intensely listen to the public narrative about our industry,” Cigna Group CEO David Cordani said during an earnings call on Jan. 30. Cigna is focused on “making prior authorizations faster and simpler,” he added.
The first Trump administration and the Biden administration put forth policies designed to improve prior authorization for some patients by mandating that insurers set up electronic systems and shortening the time companies may take to issue decisions, among other fixes. Hundreds of House Democrats and Republicans signed on to co-sponsor a bill last year that would establish new prior authorization rules for Medicare Advantage plans. In January, Republican congressman Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey introduced a federal bill to abolish the use of prior authorization altogether.
Meanwhile, many states have passed legislation to regulate the use of prior authorization. Some laws require insurers to publish data about prior authorization denials with the intention of making a confusing system more transparent. Reform bills are under consideration by state legislatures in Hawaii and elsewhere. A bill in Virginia approved by the governor March 18 takes effect July 1. Other states, including Texas, have established “gold card” programs that ease prior authorization requirements for some physicians by allowing doctors with a track record of approvals to bypass the rules.
No one from AHIP, an insurance industry lobbying group formerly known as America’s Health Insurance Plans, was available to be interviewed on the record about proposed prior authorization legislation for this article.
But changes wouldn’t guarantee that the most vulnerable patients would be spared from future insurance denials or the complex appeals process set up by insurers. Some doctors and advocates for patients are skeptical that prior authorization can be fixed as long as insurers are accountable to shareholders.
Kindyl Boyer, director of advocacy for the nonprofit Infusion Access Foundation, remains hopeful the system can be improved but likened some efforts to playing “Whac-A-Mole.” Ultimately, insurance companies are “going to find a different way to make more money,” she said.
 
In the weeks following Thompson’s killing, UnitedHealthcare was trying to refute an onslaught of what it called “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information” about its practices when another incident landed the company back in the spotlight.
On Jan. 7, Elisabeth Potter, a breast reconstruction surgeon in Austin, Texas, posted a video on social media criticizing the company for questioning whether one of her patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery that day needed to be admitted as an inpatient.
The video amassed millions of views.
In the days following her post, UnitedHealthcare hired a high-profile law firm to demand a correction and public apology from Potter. In an interview with KFF Health News, Potter would not discuss details about the dispute, but she stood by what she said in her original video.
“I told the truth,” Potter said.
The facts of the incident remain in dispute. But the level of attention it received online illustrates how frustrated and vocal many people have become about insurance company tactics since Thompson’s killing, said Matthew Zachary, a former cancer patient and the host of “Out of Patients,” a podcast that aims to amplify the experiences of patients.
For years, doctors and patients have taken to social media to shame health insurers into approving treatment. But in recent months, Zachary said, “horror stories” about prior authorization shared widely online have created “unified anger.”
“Most people thought they were alone in the victimization,” Zachary said. “Now they know they’re not.”
Data published in January by KFF found that prior authorization is particularly burdensome for patients covered by Medicare Advantage plans. In 2023, virtually all Medicare Advantage enrollees were covered by plans that required prior authorization, while people enrolled in traditional Medicare were much less likely to encounter it, said Jeannie Fuglesten Biniek, an associate director at KFF’s Program on Medicare Policy. Furthermore, she said, Medicare Advantage enrollees were more likely to face prior authorization for higher-cost services, including inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and chemotherapy.
But Neil Parikh, national chief medical officer for medical management at UnitedHealthcare, explained prior authorization rules apply to fewer than 2% of the claims the company pays. He added that “99% of the time” UnitedHealthcare members don’t need prior authorization or requests are approved “very, very quickly.”
Recently, he said, a team at UnitedHealthcare was reviewing a prior authorization request for an orthopedic procedure when they discovered the surgeon planned to operate on the wrong side of the patient’s body. UnitedHealthcare caught the mistake in time, he recounted.
“This is a real-life example of why prior authorization can really help,” Parikh said.
Even so, he said, UnitedHealthcare aims to make the process less burdensome by removing prior authorization requirements for some services, rendering instant decisions for certain requests, and establishing a national gold card program, among other refinements. Cigna also announced changes designed to improve prior authorization in the months since Thompson’s killing.
“Brian was an incredible friend and colleague to many, many of us, and we are deeply saddened by his passing,” Parikh said. “It’s truly a sad occasion.”
[subhed] The Final Denial 

During the summer of 2023, Ekirch was working full time and preparing to take the bar exam when she noticed numbness and tingling in her arms and legs. Eventually, she started experiencing a burning sensation throughout her body.
That fall, a Richmond-area neurologist said her symptoms were consistent with small fiber neuropathy, and, in early 2024, a rheumatologist recommended IVIG to ease her pain. Since then, other specialists, including neurologists at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, have said she may benefit from the same treatment.
There’s no guarantee it will work. A randomized controlled trial published in 2021 found pain levels in patients who received IVIG weren’t significantly different from the placebo group, while an older study found patients responded “remarkably well.”
“It’s hard because I look at my peers from law school and high school — they’re having families, excelling in their career, living their life. And most days I am just struggling, just to get out of bed,” said Ekirch, frustrated that Anthem continues to deny her claim.
In a prepared statement, Kersha Cartwright, a spokesperson for Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, said Ekirch’s request for IVIG treatment was denied “because it did not meet the established medical criteria for effectiveness in treating small fiber neuropathy.”
On Feb. 17, her treatment was denied by Anthem for the final time. Ekirch said her patient advocate, a nurse who works for Anthem, suggested she reach out to the drug manufacturer about patient charity programs.
“This is absolutely crazy,” Ekirch said. “This is someone from Anthem telling me to plead with a pharmacy company to give me this drug when Anthem should be covering it.”
Her only hope now lies with the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance, a state agency that resolves prior authorization disputes between patients and health insurance companies. She found out through a Facebook group for patients with small fiber neuropathy that the Bureau of Insurance has overturned an IVIG denial before. In late March, Ekirch was anxiously waiting to hear the agency’s decision about her case.

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Connecticut officials reached a settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings clearing a path for the operator to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency room and behavioral health at Rockville General Hospital in Vernon, according to an agreement published on May 23.
Rockville is one of three hospitals in Connecticut owned by Los Angeles-based Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in January.
The settlement signed on Friday between Prospect and the state of Connecticut concludes an ongoing state investigation into unauthorized service cuts at Rockville launched in October of last year. Prospect agreed that Connecticut will have a $300,000 claim included in the bankruptcy case as a result of the termination of services, subject to approval by the court.
The terms require Prospect to maintain emergency services at Rockville for three years and keep existing inpatient behavioral health services “at or within 30 miles of their current location on the RGH campus.” However, it doesn’t require the operator to reopen services that were cut without state permission.
The agreement also grants Prospect permission from the state’s Office of Health Strategy, or OHS, to terminate Rockville’s status as a full-service acute care hospital and convert it into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. Prospect must now also obtain permission for the consolidation from the Department of Public Health, which oversees hospital licensing, Wendy Fuchs, a spokesperson for OHS confirmed.
A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.
In a Friday press release, OHS Commissioner Deidre Gifford said the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital.  The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read.
The agreement requires Prospect to announce the consolidation of Rockville with Manchester Memorial publicly, create an interim strategic plan for services at Rockville and hold a community forum within 60 days.
Spokespeople with Prospect Medical Holdings and Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which owns Rockville General and Manchester Memorial, did not respond to a request for comment.
In March, Suzanne Koenig, a bankruptcy-court appointed patient care ombuds reported that, during a visit to Rockville General, she found that surgical services, as well as the intensive care and medical-surgical units at the hospital had remained closed since March 2020. The company did not receive state permission to permanently close any of those services in advance of doing so.
State law defines a termination of services as “the cessation of any services for a period greater than one hundred eighty days.” Termination of services by a hospital without state approval can result in civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day.
The unauthorized cuts were the subject of an October 2023 investigation by the Connecticut Mirror.
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, state officials offered assurances that its three Connecticut hospitals would remain open and operating.
​​“Some people think bankruptcy means the lights go out and the party’s over. That’s not true at all. These hospitals are very successful,” Lamont said during a press conference in the days following the bankruptcy announcement.
Although Rockville General will technically remain operational, it will no longer be a stand-alone, full-service acute care hospital.
A spokesperson for Lamont did not return a request for comment.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, whose district contains Rockville General Hospital, said Friday that the state had failed her residents.
“Profit over people. That’s what I think we’ve come to expect here unfortunately from OHS and the state when it comes to health care for residents that are not in large cities,” Nuccio said.
The agreement with the state will be binding for any future buyers of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals.
Yale New Haven Health first reached a tentative agreement to purchase the three facilities from Prospect for $435 million in 2022. But the deal has been mired in complications since then, including lawsuits and, most recently, Prospect’s bankruptcy. In February, Yale said it would be “impossible” to close the deal.
An auction process for the Prospect-owned hospitals will take place through bankruptcy court.
In the state’s Friday announcement, OHS said the process is “ongoing.” In court documents, the sale hearing was tentatively scheduled for June 5, but no notice of hearing has been officially posted and spokespeople for Prospect and their lawyers have not responded to multiple requests regarding the auction timeline.

If enacted, the budget moves would wreak havoc on campuses everywhere, but especially at the nation’s 1,100 community colleges, including 15 here in Massachusetts, which enroll a third of America’s undergraduates, including the poorest, most underserved and vulnerable students in all of higher education. 
The post Trump cuts would devastate community colleg[...]","FOR THE PAST few months, America’s most prestigious universities have been under attack by a president intent on chastening “woke elites” and flexing his political muscle to show that not even the world’s most esteemed institutions of higher learning are beyond his control. But while public attention has been focused on Ivy-leaguers like Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania striking deals or filing lawsuits to protect the billions of dollars in federal funding and other public subsidies they receive, another, potentially more dire threat has received much less coverage. It’s a threat with far more sweeping consequences for American higher education and the preparation of the nation’s future workforce. Congress is considering dramatic changes to federal financial aid that would disproportionately harm community college students, and President Trump has presented a budget for next year that would eliminate nearly every form of federal support for the nation’s most disadvantaged students and institutions. In a surprise move during Congress’s budget reconciliation process, the House Education and Workforce Committee has recommended major changes to the federal Pell Grant program, which awards around $30 billion annually to more than six million low-income students, while at the same time President Trump has released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which would eliminate TRIO programs aiding first-generation college students, federal Work-Study, and other programs that support college access and success. Taken together, if enacted, the budget moves would wreak havoc on campuses everywhere, but especially at the nation’s 1,100 community colleges, including 15 here in Massachusetts, which enroll a third of America’s undergraduates, including the poorest, most underserved and vulnerable students in all of higher education. The Pell Grant: A Pathway to College for Millions For more than half a century, the Pell Grant Program has provided assistance to students with exceptional financial need, offering them a more affordable pathway to a college degree.  While the grant originally paid for nearly all the cost of attending college, including tuition and living expenses, over the years it has not kept up with inflation. Still, it provides up to $7,400 a year per student, about 25 percent of the cost of attending a public university, and half the cost of enrolling at a community college. Right now, the Pell Grant guidelines define a full-time student as someone enrolled in 12 or more credits. Students can take any number of credits each semester they are enrolled and can qualify for a prorated amount of Pell Grant support based on their courseload.   For example, a low-income student taking twelve credits would qualify for the full $7,400 award, while the same student taking three credits would only qualify for 25 percent, or $1,850, of the that amount. The changes to the Pell Grant recommended by the House committee would make it harder to qualify for support by redefining full-time enrollment as at least 15 credits and eliminating funding for students enrolled less than halftime, or 7.5 credits. Students attending four-year universities would barely notice the difference: Nearly 90 percent of them are enrolled full-time and would not be affected by the changes. At community colleges though, where students are older and often balancing classes with jobs and families, two-thirds of them are enrolled part-time, and the proposed changes to the Pell Grant would have an immediate, devastating effect on community college student enrollment nationwide. At Northern Essex Community College, nearly half of our students are currently eligible for Pell Grants. This semester, 78 percent are enrolled part-time.  They take an average of just over 7.5 credits each semester, though the most common number of credits taken is only 6. If the proposed Pell Grant changes were implemented, they would impact nearly 3,000 students at NECC, eliminating more than $5 million in financial aid, and likely cutting enrollment by a third or more. Across all fifteen community colleges in Massachusetts, the changes would affect tens of thousands of students, slashing over $80 million in support and decimating enrollment at the state’s community colleges. To add injury to injury, the state’s free community college programs, MassReconnect and MassEducate, are “last dollar in” programs that rely on federal Pell Grants.   If Massachusetts had to cover the lost $80 million, especially facing an increasingly bleak budget year ahead, those programs, which were designed to meet the Commonwealth’s future workforce needs, might not be able to continue, and the state’s anticipated college-educated worker shortage would get even worse. Student Support Services Endangered While the House committee’s Pell Grant changes would likely result in millions of students dropping out of community colleges because of lost financial aid, the president’s proposed $4 billion budget reductions to the federal TRIO, GEAR UP, Work Study, Child Care and other student support programs would endanger the prospects of those who still managed to enroll. All of the cuts would be harmful, especially to community college students, but the most significant reductions are to TRIO, which is actually a collection of eight different programs, including Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Student Support Services, all designed to support low-income students, those who are the first in their families to attend college, and students with disabilities. Altogether, there are more than 3,500 TRIO projects serving nearly 900,000 students across the country for just under $2 billion annually.  While outcomes may vary by project, collectively research has shown that TRIO programs have a significant positive impact on college enrollment, retention, and graduation for the students they serve. As an example: For more than four decades, Northern Essex Community College’s TRIO-funded PACE Program has served around 250 first generation, low-income students a year, providing them with study skills workshops and coaching, essay writing tutorials, internship opportunities, field trips to four-year universities, and access to transfer scholarships. The results are spectacular: Every year, persistence, academic standing, and graduation rates for PACE students are 20-30 percent higher than the overall student population, all at a cost of just $1,500 or so annually for each student, an amazing return on investment. Each of the programs the president is aiming to eliminate serves a marginalized, at-risk population of students, such as those with the greatest need for financial assistance, single parents, first generation students, veterans, or students with disabilities; or provides assistance to under-resourced institutions like community colleges or schools that, based on their  enrollment demographics, are designated as minority serving institutions. An Existential Threat to the Safety Net Every budget is a reflection of someone’s priorities.  Those priorities can be debated, and reasonable minds may disagree, but whether you support it or not, President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget represents the most extreme reductions to America’s social safety net programs proposed by any president in modern history. It recommends cutting nondefense discretionary funding, mostly resources for education (like the TRIO Program), health, and housing programs that benefit the poor, by $163 billion to the lowest level since recordkeeping began in the 1960s, in order to fund more defense and border security spending, and extend his 2017 tax cuts, which have primarily benefitted corporations, investors, and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. While the president insists he is putting “America first” and delivering national economic prosperity with his “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the budget working its way through Congress, if adopted, would inflict enormous damage on disadvantaged populations nationwide.  When it comes to community colleges, it’s doing anything but putting America – and Americans — first. These cuts will pull the rug out from under working-class Americans who are trying hard to better their lives and that of their family — and whose efforts will boost America’s economy and global competitiveness in the process.  It is a vision, and a budget, we must vigorously oppose.  Lane Glenn is president of Northern Essex Community College.  The post Trump cuts would devastate community colleges, undermining lower-income students striving to better their lives   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/massbay-e1707743859561.jpeg?fit=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-25 11:02:14.982163

Credit: Tracey AttleeMore than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)During her tenure as the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem liked to remind legislators at budget time that the money they were dealing with was not their own. 
From a 2019 address to the Legislature: “I’m committed to maintaining the fiscal integrity for which our state is known. We won’t spend money we don’t have. We will not raise taxes.”
From 2022: “I recognize that taxpayer dollars are not our own — they belong to the people of South Dakota. We all must remember throughout our budget discussions that this money belongs to the hard-working people of South Dakota.”
From 2025: “During my time as governor, I have always kept my budget proposals focused on our people, not government programs. After all, this is the people’s money. They entrust it to us and expect us to spend it wisely and responsibly.”

Those are good reminders that legislators should take to heart. However, it seems that Noem was just reading from the teleprompter rather than paying attention to her own advice. Recently Noem’s actions with taxpayer dollars were the topic of discussion on a couple of fronts. 
A South Dakota Searchlight story noted that the Government Operations and Audit Committee in Pierre was trying to get answers about how Noem rang up $750,000 on her state credit card during her six years as governor. Noem admonished lawmakers to look out for the way taxpayer dollars were spent while she was racking up travel expenses on a book tour, a Canadian hunting excursion and various out-of-state political trips to tout the hopes of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. 
Who’s to say if South Dakota will ever have another governor like Noem who became the darling of the Republican Party for her reaction to the pandemic. During her many travels, she was quick to praise South Dakota’s maskless response to the pandemic and just as quick to label as fake news anyone who dared point out that the state was leading the league in per capita COVID-19 deaths. 
Lawmakers on the committee learned that under the current laws, there isn’t much that state bookkeepers can do when called on to cover a governor’s credit card expenses. They can question a credit card charge, but if it isn’t then handled voluntarily by the elected official, the state has to pay. 
Basically, the current law treats elected officials like adults. As adults, those officials should know when the people should pay and when they should reach into their own wallets to cover any expense that doesn’t directly have anything to do with their elected positions. Given the example Noem set, lawmakers who took her advice about fiscal integrity seriously are now faced with proposing legislation that calls for creating some sort of credit card overseer or nanny. That’s a move that wouldn’t be needed if Noem’s credit card use was more statesmanlike instead of resembling a sailor on leave. 
Another Searchlight story published on the same day chronicled Noem’s appearance before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. At the meeting, Noem had it pointed out that her new department has budget problems. 
“Your department is out of control,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. “You are running out of money.”
Given that Noem has been given responsibility for Trump’s signature issue — immigration control — it would certainly be a bad look for the president if the department charged with rounding up illegal immigrants ran out of funds before the end of the fiscal year. Fiscal restraint may be the order of the day as Noem works for a man who changes Cabinet secretaries the way other presidents changed their socks. 
For her part, Noem doesn’t seem like she’s pinching pennies, spending $100 million on TV commercials that praise Trump policies and warn immigrants not to come to the United States illegally. 
She has also unveiled a plan to offer $1,000 in “travel assistance” to illegal immigrants who self-deport. The cost of that could be as much as $1 billion if Trump reaches his goal of deporting 1 million people. Those hardly seem like the actions of someone who has been entrusted by taxpayers to spend their funds “wisely and responsibly.”
All of Noem’s budget guidance for South Dakota lawmakers should have come with another bit of helpful advice: Do as I say, not as I do.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season, a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season and a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.

The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, Louisiana, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms—including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125 percent of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130 percent of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51 percent chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26 percent chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33 percent chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56 percent chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets, because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

Lancaster Hill and other Black Americans in the Massachusetts Bay colony, “who are detained in a state of Slavery in the Bowels of a free & Christian Country,” declared in a petition that they were born free just like the white citizens and “have never forfeited this Blessing by any compact or agreement whatever.” 
Seven years later, Elizabeth “Bett” Freeman heard that the new Massachusetts Constitution said every person had a right to freedom. The next day, she approached a lawyer and was quoted as asking, “I heard that paper read yesterday, that says, all men are created equal, and that every man has a right to freedom.” She said she wanted her freedom, too. The lawyer agreed and filed a lawsuit on behalf of her and another African American. 
In 1781, the case went to court, and a jury ruled in her favor, making her the first Black woman set free under the Massachusetts state constitution. 
“Any time while I was a slave,” she said, “if one minute’s freedom had been offered to me and I had been told I must die at the end of that minute, I would have taken it, just to stand one minute on God’s earth a free woman!”
At the same time, Quock Walker sued his former master, Nathaniel Jennison, for battery. After the local courts ruled in his and Freeman’s favor, they pressed the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on whether the state’s Constitution applied to those enslaved. That challenge led to Supreme Court Chief Justice William Cushing’s conclusion that slavery was “inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)It took six months, but the race for the North Carolina Supreme Court is finally over. The rules of the game held – just as they did following the 2020 election – and the winner is now in office.
That’s a win for democracy.
And we owe that win in large part to an exceptionally strong ruling from Trump-appointed judge Richard E. Myers II, chief judge of the Eastern District of North Carolina.    
While other branches might be absent (Congress), or ambivalent on whether or not it has to follow the Constitution (Executive), the federal judiciary continues to hold the line.
North Carolina is one of seven states that has partisan elections for its judges. In the November 2024 election for one of North Carolina’s Supreme Court seats, Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes. Out of 5,540,090 votes. Griffin challenged the results in court, as is his right.
Included in Griffin’s challenges were attempts to retroactively challenge the state’s election laws, and then use the new understanding of the law to throw out 60,000 presumptively-valid votes. All based in election denial conspiracies.
Such an effort violates two important principles of how our elections are run: 1) You can’t change the rules of the game after the game, and 2) You can’t punish voters for following the rules as they were understood at the time.
These principles are what kept Al Gore from invalidating 25,000 likely-Republican votes in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, and they’re what allow for finality in election results.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals and the North Carolina Supreme Court shocked the election community by partially indulging Griffin’s after-the-fact challenges. They showed they were willing to set a dangerous precedent of legitimizing false claims of voter fraud, especially in close margin races. 
If the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision had held, and if it had gained popularity in other state courts, then we would have been in a world of trouble for 2026. Elections would drag on for months.  
For example, if I, in Arizona, narrowly lost an election, but then challenged the legality of mail balloting, then that legal theory would have to be fully litigated before calling an end to the election. Despite the fact that I could have challenged the legality of mail voting before the election.  
Imagine if the election in dispute had been a seat in Congress. Or if the partisan balance of Congress had only been divided by one vote. Would we have been waiting until May to seat the Speaker of the House?
Maybe then it would’ve gotten more attention nationally. It flew largely under the radar for many Americans. And who can blame them? Democracy is under attack from so many angles, who can keep up?
The truth is, election denial was alive and well in North Carolina this election cycle. But ultimately, the federal courts stepped in and settled the race once and for all.
Judge Myers didn’t hesitate to rebuke the problematic nature of such an approach. He wrote: “A post-election change of practice that results in the discarding of votes is abominable under the Constitution of the United States.” 
Griffin ultimately called off the fight and conceded to Riggs, allowing her to, finally, be sworn in to a new term on the North Carolina Supreme Court.
As long as I wasn’t one of the candidates, nor a North Carolina citizen looking for finality, there’s a silver lining. The ruling provided a persuasive refresher on election law for judges.  It came from the chief judge of a district. It came from a Republican-appointed judge. It came from a Trump-appointed judge. 
Don’t get me wrong. The lawsuit threatened to undermine the legitimacy of our election system and silence the eligible voters. It’s going to take time for pro-democracy officials in North Carolina, and across our country, to rebuild trust in our election system.
We have the federal courts to thank for keeping our election system free, fair, and secure this cycle. I firmly believe that almost all federal judges consistently do the right thing according to fact and law, regardless of their politics. But for those who think the judiciary is just “politics in robes,” we couldn’t have asked for a better ambassador for election-law-sanity than we got in this federal court.
As I have said many times over the past few months, thank goodness for our federal judiciary, one which continues to be the envy of the world.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5131673-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

Hounding disturbs the peace of public lands and occurs on private properties without consent. It often lacks meaningful regulation or enforcement, especially during the training period.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lisa Jablow: Preparing for hound training season.","Dear Editor,Hounding involves releasing packs of dogs to chase wildlife, such as bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes and raccoons until the animals are cornered, treed (forced up a tree) or simply too exhausted to continue. The hound “training” season begins on June 1 in Vermont and lasts all summer long, offering wildlife little reprieve from harassment. The practice can be particularly traumatic at this time of year for mother animals and their offspring. Hounding occurs on both public and private lands, raising ethical and legal concerns among property owners and outdoor recreationists who fear run-ins with uncontrolled hounds. It causes extreme stress and suffering for both the hunted animals and the hounds, especially when violent encounters occur between the dogs and their quarry, sometimes resulting in severe injuries or death. Young wild animals who can’t outrun the hounds stand little chance of escape.  Hounding also disturbs the peace of public lands and occurs on private properties without consent. It often lacks meaningful regulation or enforcement, especially during the training period. Raccoon, bobcat and fox hounding, for example, are governed by few regulations, allowing hounders to run their dogs even in the middle of night.If you’re looking to take action, there are several potential steps:Contact legislators to advocate for restrictions or bans on hound hunting.

Fern was known for her kindness, joy and strong connection to nature. We are also deeply troubled by the outcome of the trial of Seth Brunell, which failed to deliver justice for Fern. This injustice was not merely an isolated incident. It is part of a broader, deeply rooted pattern of violence and neglect that transgender people face across the United States.READ MORE
Our Quaker faith teaches that there is that of God in everyone. This belief calls us to affirm the dignity, worth and spiritual gifts of all people. Our community is enriched by the presence of transgender and gender diverse individuals. Transgender people deserve not only affirmation, but protection. To honor Fern is to reject the negligence and prejudice that enable transphobia to thrive in courtrooms, police departments, and legislatures. It is to recognize that the criminal legal system is not only broken, but structurally incapable of serving the communities most impacted by violence.Vermont has taken crucial steps towards creating a safe and inclusive environment for transgender people. However, we still must hold our public institutions accountable. When our system fails to uphold justice for Fern, it has failed all of us. We must allow ourselves to grieve, but it is equally important to transform that grief into courage, solidarity and love towards the transgender community. We recognize that honoring each person’s self-identified gender is a spiritual practice rooted in love and truth. As Friends, we are called to speak out against injustice and to work towards a world where all people can live free from fear and violence. Fern’s life reminds us of the beauty and resilience of transgender people. Her death reminds us of the urgent need for cultural and political change across our society.

This story was originally reported by Alexis Wray, Eden Turner and Sabreen Dawud of The 19th. Meet Alexis, Eden and Sabreen and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Sunday is the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.
Furthermore, in 2025, 67 percent of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65 percent felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
 ‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’

Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.

Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

 ‘I hope many people hold onto … the possibility that lies ahead’

Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”

 ‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’

Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

 ‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’

While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

 ‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’

In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/george-floyd-square-1024x593.jpeg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

If the tidegates on No Name Slough — an estuary at the Skagit River delta — appear to be stained, crusted and a bit sagging with age, it could be because they are 60 years old.
If they fail, 450 acres of prime farmland could be inundated with salt water spilling in from Padilla Bay, and lost to farming.
The Skagit Delta tidegates have a simple purpose: to drain farmland when the tide goes out, then block incoming tides when they come lapping at the gate. The Skagit River delta produces about 90% of the agricultural value of all farms in Skagit County. Some of the highest value crops — spinach and cabbage seed, wheat and barley — grow on the soil protected by the diking districts.
The gates have made the Skagit River delta one of the state’s most productive farmland areas, acre for acre, for 140 years. Now, the future of farming on 60,000 acres of delta land protected by a network of dikes and 100 tidegates can no longer be assumed.
The issue is now being fought in federal court. A lawsuit brought by Skagit Dike, Drainage and Irrigation Improvement District 12 seeks to overturn a biological opinion by National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, that the district says imposed onerous impact fees for merely repairing existing infrastructure.
The fate of the Skagit delta’s highly fertile farmland is inextricably intertwined with that of the Chinook salmon, classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.
The district lost its request for summary judgement  in the first round on April 28, when U.S. District Court Judge Brian A. Tsuchida ruled for NMFS on all key claims. The decision was based on review of documents filed by both sides.
Tsuchida’s decision mooted his earlier decision in 2024 that the district could proceed with repairs because NMFS had taken too long in its environmental review of the tidegate repair permit.
At issue, notes the ruling, is “NMFS’ conclusion that the No Name Slough tidegate project would further reduce the quality and perpetuate poor conditions of nearshore and estuary habitat for Puget Sound Chinook for an additional 50 years” — thus necessitating habitat mitigation and restoration. In bringing suit, District 12 contends the project is “a simple tidegate replacement which does not expand the footprint of existing structures, and provides benefits to fish.”
Commissioners of the district voted on May 12 to file an appeal with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing before a three-judge appeals panel is not yet scheduled.
 ‘Disappointed’

Jenna Friebel, executive director of the consortium that represents all 12 diking districts, said her organization “disagrees with and is disappointed with the district court’s decision.”
A rule that NMFS adopted in November of 2020 imposes substantial mitigation fees for any nearshore infrastructure repairs, from tidegates to Port of Seattle piers.
The No Name Slough tidegates are the first in the Skagit delta system to face the consequences of the rule. Before the change, the Skagit Tidegate Fish Initiative, or TFI, in 2010 established a system whereby tidegate improvements could be made without having to go to NMFS for permission for every individual project.
The Diking District 12 tidegate replacement on No Name Slough has been pending for four years, since the district’s original application for a permit approval from NMFS.
The ruling expands the baseline for determining effects of a repair project from the immediate vicinity of the work to the entire Puget Sound range of Chinook salmon. The next step under ESA, unless conditions for Chinook recovery show improvement, would be to declare the species endangered, triggering more stringent rules to protect the fish.
The rule also has been extended to include repairs to public infrastructure such as piers, waterfront bulkheads, ports and any other project that NMFS decides must involve mitigation fees.
 Added cost for district

For District 12, that would add $2.5 million in mitigation fees on top of whatever it costs to replace the tidegate and repairs to a section of the dike around it. What NMFS wants to have mitigated is the subject of a lawsuit the district filed against the agency last December.
Tsuchida sided with the federal fisheries agency on virtually every issue, citing at one point the “deference” given to NMFS as the source of expertise and scientific knowledge on the ESA.
Despite disagreement with the ruling, “our member districts remain committed to working with state and federal resource agencies and local tribes to develop solutions to the complex at hand that are grounded in facts and science,” Friebel said.
Senior Civil Prosecutor Will Honea, who deals with natural resource issues, said that Skagit County government has no direct stake in the District 12 lawsuit against NMFS.
“However,” he said, “We are concerned that NMFS’s single-minded focus on punitive regulatory measures is preventing productive progress in the Skagit, damaging the Skagit fisheries resource, hampering our ability to prepare for sea level rise and climate change and creating unnecessary conflict in our community.”
NMFS officials have declined to comment on the ruling.
 Swinomish perspective

The TFI was intended to make the process of obtaining permits for work on tidegates easier for applicants. The Army Corps of Engineers was empowered to issue permits directly for tidegate repairs under terms of the TFI approved by NMFS. It created an oversight board consisting of dike district representatives, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and Skagit County, state Fish and Wildlife and NMFS, with a staff member acting as coordinator.
The program included a system by which districts could acquire “credits” by doing work that made “operational improvements” to their tidegate systems. Districts could do the work even if they did not have any credits stored.
The Swinomish objected, complaining that the districts were using the operational improvements to do work that was more than the system should have allowed. The tribe gave 60 days notice of intent to sue NMFS. The tribe threatened to sue the Corps of Engineers for approving the District 12 work after its own finding that the project would have minimal effect on the threatened Chinook.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tidegate.jpg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

(Screenshot from event video stream)A panel of speakers at a Tuesday “Voices for Veterans” event recently agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The panelists’ remarks were in response to a question by moderator Michael McElroy, a political correspondent at Cardinal & Pine, the North Carolina online publication that hosted the event for the purpose of “supporting North Carolina’s veterans and military families.”
 Big VA cuts spark big worries

The comments came amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The nation must do for veterans what it said it would do with “no strings attached, with no arguments, with no pushback,” Patterson-Powell said.
(U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”)
Dr. Kyle Horton, founder of On Your Side Health, a nonprofit that addresses health care disparities and works to improve veterans’ care, said the nation has a sacred obligation to protect those who serve.
“Those who wrote a blank check in service to this country with their lives do not deserve to be penny-pinched by Washington bureaucrats,” Horton said.
Horton added: “They don’t deserve to be penny-pinched by Captain Bone Spurs in the White House [a reference to President Donald Trump, who obtained a medical excuse from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs] right now and they don’t deserve to be penny pinched by DOGE [the so-called Department of Government Efficiency] and  [Elon] Musk who don’t even know what they’re doing. Period.”
Patterson-Powell said there is a push by the Trump administration to privatize the VA. That could be harmful to veterans who wouldn’t receive the specialized care they now get at the VA, she said.
  Scott Peoples (Screenshot from event video stream)
Scott Peoples, a retired Army captain, member of Veterans for Responsible Leadership (VFRL) and an advocate for free and fair elections, noted that America fights its wars with volunteers. The proposed budget VA budget cuts could make people think twice about making a commitment to serve, Peoples said.
“How we take care of them after service is kind of our Number One recruiting tool as well for future people who want to join the military,” Peoples said.
He said the Trump administration’s firing of VA staff members made him angry.
“Every single one of those people got into it for the right reasons; wants to serve their country by taking care of our veterans and the way they have so inhumanely shrugged off cutting people with no transparency, just people receiving emails, people having moved their families across country [to work at the VA], is just despicable,” Peoples said.   
  Grier Martin (Screenshot from event video stream)
Grier Martin, Secretary of the NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said the cuts would have a devastating impact on rural communities.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to see the VA’s presence in rural areas start to dry out,” Martin said. “These are areas that are already starting to see their civilian hospitals close also.”
The state’s decision to expand Medicaid has been helpful in helping some rural hospitals remain open, he said, but veterans will have difficulty finding care near home if the VA’s presence is diminished.
“If you live on the coast, you’re not going to drive to Durham and you’re probably not going to drive to Fayetteville to the VA hospital to get your care,” Grier said.
Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the outpouring of concern and support for veterans gives him cause for hope amid threats of major cuts to the VA.
“That is how change happens,” Ager said. “It may not be immediate. It may not always be completely satisfying. But the fact that veterans are coming together, that the community is coming together to support veterans, I think will eventually lead to change.”   
 Threats to democracy

A second panel discussion moderated by Cardinal & Pine’s managing editor Billy Ball, focused on threats to democracy and the evolving role of veterans as defenders of democracy.
  Bobby Jones (Screenshot from event video stream)
Panelist Bobby Jones, president of VFRL and retired Navy commander, said he could see the cost of freedom in the faces of the veterans in the audience. Jones said the services the VA provides are essential to national security.
“I know this panel is about national security, but my thing is you cannot have one without the other,” Jones said. “The VA has to be sound in order for us to have a proper national security apparatus.”
Jones was critical of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said neither man understands the concept of service to country.
“For the first time, I believe in American history, we have leadership that doesn’t get it, that thinks the Constitution is nothing more than a suggestion,” Jones said. “Hell, even the South for the Civil War had the good sense to defect and secede before going against the Constitution.”
America is in “unparalleled, unprecedented times” and veterans must step up to lead the country out the quagmire, Jones said.
Ball asked the panel to discuss the much-watched North Carolina Supreme Court race between Republican Jefferson Griffin and Allison Riggs, a Democrat. The outcome of the closely contested race wasn’t resolved until this month after nearly six months. Griffin conceded after a federal judge ordered the state to certify Riggs’ election victory.
Military and overseas votes were at the center of the election dispute. Griffin challenged the validity of some military and overseas absentee ballots in the 2024 contest.
“To protect military and veterans’ families’ votes, really has to come from the voters, really has to come from political pressure,” said Sean Wright, a former Army medic. “We have to make it, as voters, unacceptable to take away the right to vote.”
Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) said men and women who serve overseas have expectations that they will be treated with a certain amount of respect.
“This election really showed how little the powers that be cared about that,” Brown said. “I like to think about it in terms of people that talk a good game, but they don’t back it up.”
Brown said Americans can’t afford to take a day off defending democracy.
“We have to make sure that’s it’s not just doing election season, it’s not just when there are votes on the line, it’s not just when a bad thing happens,” Brown said. “It’s all the time that we’re making sure that y’all are laser-focused on protecting against threats to our democracy.”
Jay Carey, leader of Resist & Persist, a nonpartisan veterans advocacy organization, said the challenge to the state Supreme Court election was a test by the GOP to determine how much the judicial system and voters could stomach.
Carey, who garnered national attention after he was escorted out of U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards’ townhall meeting in Asheville in March, said there will be more challenges to valid election victories.
“They’re [the challenges] are going to get more and more ridiculous,” Carey said. “It’s going to tie up time and waste more money. Like I said, it was a test. They just wanted to see what they could do.”
The discussion turned to talk of Trump’s removing the military’s Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) and replacing them with what some panelists said are loyalists to the administration. JAGs advise commanders on legal matters and oversee the military judicial system.
Jones said the legal protections provided by JAGs are critical to defending the nation against internal threats he fears are coming from the Trump administration.
“I can’t stress the panic level enough on this,” Jones said. “All of the dominoes are falling. To those of us paying attention, it’s blatantly obvious. Any time there’s a voice of dissent, they shut it down.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,It’s time for lawmakers to do Mississippi taxpayers a solid in the special session,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/25/its-time-for-lawmakers-to-do-mississippi-taxpayers-a-solid-in-the-special-session/,Column: It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had lawmakers finished their work on time earlier this year. Here's how they can make it up to us.,"In early April, the Mississippi Legislature opted to end the 2025 session and come back in special session, at greater expense to taxpayers, to pass a budget for the upcoming fiscal year that begins July 1.
It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had legislators just voted to remain in regular session to work on the budget. They could have remained in regular session without actually being in Jackson until an agreement between legislative leaders was reached on a budget. At that point, members could have come back to Jackson to vote on the budget, and the additional expenses would have been nominal.
In special session, legislators receive the same expense reimbursements they receive in regular session. In addition, however, the 175 members (including the lieutenant governor) will receive an additional $75 per day.
It is worth noting that legislators receive $1,500 per month when out of session. If they had voted to remain in regular session, they would not have received the $1,500 for April and the $1,500 for May.
Granted, in a representative democracy, making laws can be messy and disagreements occur that lead to added expenses. Those additional expenses can be the cost of living in this country. After all, Russia does not have to worry about additional expenses for lawmakers because of disagreements with Vladimir Putin.
And this is not intended as an argument that Mississippi legislators receive too much money. After all, they have not received a pay raise since 1997 except for increases in their daily per diem when in session for living expenses. The per diem is tied to the federal rate.
But this is simply to point out that legislators had a choice to make back in April: stay in regular session for less money or come back in for a more costly special session.
Since at this point there is no escaping the added expenses for the Legislature being in special session, there are a few extra steps lawmakers could take to give the taxpayers something more for their money.
First of all, when they come back, they should work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Presumably, legislative leaders have been working behind the scenes to reach a budget accord. So, when the governor calls the special session and legislators return to the Capitol, they should be ready and rearing to go.
Second, pass a responsible budget that takes care of the people of the state and not the special interest of any particular legislator or group of legislators.
And finally — and this is an important one — be transparent. The final passage of the state budget normally occurs in the waning hours of the regular session and in one big blur. Transparency is almost never a focus.
The budget is passed piecemeal in more than 100 individual bills. And while this has not always been the case, in recent years often there has not been a readily available document that provides information so that it can be ascertained whether agencies are receiving more or less funding and how the funding the agencies are receiving is being divvied up.
Many legislators often do not actually know what they are voting on when passing the budget in the fog of the end of the regular session.
Legislative leaders, during their out-of-session negotiations, should have had plenty of time to have staff develop such documents, which used to be provided as part of the normal budgeting process.
It could be argued that legislators like the whirlwind process and the lack of transparency because that is how things like funds for work on golf courses or work on obscure streets are sneaked into budget bills while other major needs are neglected.
But since the Legislature has been able to work behind the scenes on a budget for almost two months now, there is no excuse for the lack of transparency.
After all, taxpayers should be getting something for their money. So come on, legislators, it is time to do the taxpayers a solid.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10091749/Legislative-Session-2025-10.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerMARLBORO — As a longtime volunteer and chair of the town’s new cemetery commission, Marcia Hamilton annually prepares for Memorial Day by helping place American flags at the graves of local soldiers. This year, that tradition hit especially close to home with the latest addition to the list: The 102-year-old World War II hero she knew as Dad.Richard Henry Hamilton was born to nearby Brattleboro farmers on Sept. 28, 1922. The family didn’t plug into electricity until after he graduated from high school in 1940, which is why all were huddled around a battery-powered radio when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.“Listening to that, we didn’t know where Pearl Harbor was,” Richard recalled in a 2015 National WWII Museum interview, Drafted in 1942, the young Vermonter joined the Army Air Corps. He was serving as a radio operator and gunner on a B-17 bomber named “Destiny’s Child” when it flew over Germany on July 20, 1944.Vermont television station WCAX profiled Richard Hamilton for its “Super Senior” series in 2018. Photo by Joe Carroll/WCAX“When dots were spotted way back, we assumed that was our escort,” Richard said.Instead, the speeding specks were 60 enemy fighters that shot a wing off his plane. Richard saw bullets and a resulting blaze kill four crewmen before he and four others parachuted down 18,000 feet. Separated from his fellow soldiers, he soon found himself in a wheat field.“The whole village seemed to turn out — with their clubs and pitchforks,” he recalled in a 2008 Library of Congress interview. “I don’t speak German, but I was introduced to it very suddenly.” Richard landed in the Stalag Luft IV prisoner-of-war camp. Jailed for 10 months, he was forced out on Feb. 6, 1945, for a multiweek death march.“Day after day we were just on the road,” he said. “There was no destination.”It instead led to dysentery, frostbite, blisters, body lice and jaundice. “My feet were black and blue and infected,” he said of his 76th day. “I came to a decision that I wasn’t going to go anymore.”Miraculously, that’s when two Allied soldiers liberated him on April 24, 1945.“When we saw the Statue of Liberty, I could just sense how those immigrants placed all their hopes and dreams in that,” he said of his return home.Richard Hamilton stands second from the left in the back row for this World War II photo of the “Destiny’s Child” B-17 bomber and crew. Photo from the 91st Bomb GroupBack in Vermont, Richard married his sweetheart Joyce White and moved to Marlboro, a southeastern Vermont town known for its former namesake college and longtime music festival. There, they acquired the Skyline restaurant, which the couple ran atop Hogback Mountain until retiring almost 50 years later in 1994.Ever busy, Richard also served on the town select and school boards and as a constable, tax collector and justice of the peace. He wound the clock in the Meeting House steeple until his hip was replaced at age 90. He commanded the Vermont chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War, and after drawing faith by memorizing Psalm 91 during his capture (its line “He is my refuge and my fortress” appears on his gravestone), he helped Gideons International distribute Bibles to hotels, schools and prisons.Richard died at home on Feb. 19 at age 102, leaving four daughters, seven grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.“He was still active” attending men’s breakfasts, senior lunches and veterans’ dinners, his obituary said.Marlboro residents were still thinking about him two weeks later when they voted to create a local cemetery commission.A tree grows in Marlboro’s Center Cemetery. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAccording to state law, municipal gravesites are the responsibility of a town selectboard or city council unless a community “votes to place its public burial grounds under the charge of cemetery commissioners.”Marlboro approved Vermont’s newest such commission in a 308-22 vote March 4, electing Marcia Hamilton and fellow volunteers Hollis Burbank-Hammarlund and Sally White to its three seats. They’re now working on spring cleanup, summer mowing, year-round green options and “a user-friendly flowchart to help the public navigate the burial process,” according to meeting minutes.“One thing we plan to do is create a policy to standardize the care each cemetery gets,” Marcia said of the group, which has a $16,200 annual budget. “We’re trying to show that a commission is a good idea by not having a spurt of expenditures. It’s not going to cost any more money than it ever has.”Marcia and her family received help at her father’s graveside service May 14 at King Cemetery. More than 200 friends, neighbors, veterans and first responders assisted with a 21-gun salute, the playing of taps and a U.S. Air Force flyover.Shortly after, Marcia followed in the footsteps of her late mother by gathering three generations of her family to place American flags at the burial plots of local soldiers. She started with her father and went as far back as Revolutionary War militiaman Elijah Bruce, who is believed to have fought at the Battle of Bennington in 1777 before dying from smallpox in 1835.Each stone, she knows, has its own story.Read the story on VTDigger here:  A Vermont WWII veteran survived a death march.

(Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Maine students have been restrained and secluded more than 22,000 times a year in some years. But the real number of times educators put students in holds, move them against their will and shut them alone in small rooms is likely much higher.
Restraint and seclusion are widely condemned practices that create lasting trauma for students, their families and the educators involved. That’s why every use is supposed to be documented and reported to the state. But over the past decade, only 24 out of more than 250 private schools and public districts in Maine have consistently reported their numbers.

Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education, however the department did not say whether there was any penalty for failing to report.
Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE “has not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.”
Rather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district’s lack of reporting means schools didn’t restrain or seclude any students that year.
“It is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,” said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren’t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. “The Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.”
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it’s “beyond unlikely” that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.
Overall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state’s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data.
“I know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven’t reported,” Reilly said. “So does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.”
At least one school not reporting high use to state
A closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.
Bangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.
During the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.
None of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data.
Though Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program’s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn’t know and couldn’t find out due to recent changes in district leadership.
“The superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,” he said.
The DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school’s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department “reports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it’s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don’t report it to the state.
“We still don’t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,” he said. “So what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?”
Few districts regularly report data
This underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.
The law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic — particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.
“It’s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,” Jones said.
In the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine’s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.










I don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.


–  Superintendent Clay Gleason, Maine School Administrative District 6


Only 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.
Together, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine’s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state’s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.
In the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.
By 2022-23, MSAD 6’s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.
That district’s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student’s behavior poses an “imminent danger” of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year — a 44% drop.
“I don’t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it’s traumatic, it’s not good,” said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. “However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.”

Numbers still high despite underreporting
Despite inconsistent reporting, it’s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.
“These are still extremely high numbers,” said Jones with Lives in the Balance. “Each one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there’s probably more of it going on based on what we know.”
The number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.
Some districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But “whether they’re model programs, or whether they’re just not reporting their restraints, I don’t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,” Cobo-Lewis said.
“I have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,” he said.
While the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.
The proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student’s behavior from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Both Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop.
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
From 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Most years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries.
MSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms.
“There are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,” he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.
“But I don’t know if it’s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it’s like an internal measure,” he added.
According to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, “I have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,” he said.
While the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.
Majority of reports from schools for students with disabilities
When public school districts determine they can’t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.
Having sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student’s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that’s not always the case.
Pointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be “hotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.”
Over the past decade, Maine’s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.
Though the data from these schools haven’t been consistently included in the state’s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.
Maine’s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.
The Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state’s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows.
The centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.
There is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.

Margaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population’s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the “intensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,” she said.
They sometimes display aggression — including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair — that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.
Hathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a “last resort” but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may “over-document and over-report.”
For example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old’s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.
But repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.
“Of course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,” he said. “We are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.

“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.
But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
‘It is a fight’: Patients, OB-GYNs and sexual health advocates determined to stop Medicaid cuts

A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

But during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, that’s what happened — at least 18 times, according to Emerson and school district incident reports reviewed by the Maine Morning Star. Staff members put the 7-year-old boy in holds, forced him into empty rooms and did not let him out until he calmed down or his parents picked him up.
“It broke him, and it broke me,” Emerson said.
The trauma became so severe that her son, now a third grader, no longer attends school in person, she said.
What happened to Emerson’s son is not an isolated case. Across Maine, schools use restraint and seclusion on students more than 10,000 times each year, according to Maine Department of Education data — with some districts resorting to the emergency tactics regularly while others have changed policies and taken other steps so that such interventions are only used as a last resort.

​In recent years, Maine as a whole has made an effort to reduce restraint and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities, with the U.S. Department of Education citing staff and student injuries and the resulting trauma for students as the reasons to curtail their use. The department has also condemned and discouraged these practices for years under multiple presidential administrations. Rare cases have resulted in serious injuries to students and even death.
A 2021 state law limits restraint and seclusion to emergencies. But as Maine educators report more challenging student behavior in the years since pandemic school closures, there have been calls to allow school staff to restrain and seclude children more often. A newly proposed bill would broaden the circumstances under which school staff could restrain or seclude students, igniting debate among educators, parents and lawmakers about how to manage student behavior without inflicting harm.
The Maine Education Association and the Maine School Management Association, representing teachers and administrators statewide, both support the proposal, citing increased reports of disruptive and violent student behavior — something educators nationwide have also reported in recent years.
The Gardiner-area school system, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 11, has led the push for that proposal. Victoria Duguay, principal of River View Community School in Gardiner, and MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins shared stories with lawmakers of students who hit and spit at adults, scream in hallways, throw chairs and destroy other students’ schoolwork.
Under the 2021 state law, school staff can only restrain students (immobilize them and move them against their will) or seclude them (isolate them in a room that they can’t leave) if their behavior “poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury” — requiring medical intervention beyond first aid, according to the Maine Department of Education regulations that govern restraint and seclusion.
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” Hopkins said during an April 23 public hearing.
This extreme behavior, when it happens in a public place at school, traumatizes other students who witness it, Duguay said. The school sometimes has to close off access to common spaces — the gym or cafeteria — if a student acts out in a hallway through which students would need to pass.
Under the legislation MSAD 11 is supporting, staff would be able to move students against their will to a seclusion room or another quiet space without it counting as a restraint, which districts have to record, document, and report to the state.
But some educators who have pursued alternative training don’t agree that loosening restraint and seclusion requirements is the answer.
“The consequences of passing this bill will only inflict more trauma on students,” said Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of special education programs at the University of New England, who trains special education teachers. “Additionally, the behavior will keep happening, because restraint and seclusion is not an appropriate response to challenging behavior, and it will in no way help students remediate their behavior. These should not be referred to as strategies, treatments or solutions.”
Inside the three-hour restraint and seclusion of a 7-year-old
In October 2023, Emerson’s son started a behavior plan to help with concentration and self-regulation. The plan, which Emerson shared with the Maine Morning Star, highlighted the mother’s concerns about her son’s anger, dysregulation, anxiety and ADHD, and noted Emerson’s finding that occupational therapy had helped her son better regulate.
One week after the plan was put into place, the boy arrived at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School already agitated, hit another student with a Pete the Cat stuffed animal and tried to leave the classroom, setting off a series of escalating interventions in which staff physically restrained him, relocated him against his will, and ultimately placed him in a small room where he stayed until his father arrived, according to incident reports shared with the Maine Morning Star.
The reports, which staff or administrators are required to write, offer an inside look at the behavior leading up to the restraint, how the situation escalated as staff restrained and secluded the boy, and how it continued for three hours, ending when Seth Emerson picked his son up from a seclusion room.
When the second grader initially tried to leave his classroom, two educators cornered the boy in a hallway nook, according to the report written by the school’s assistant principal. When he tried to push past them, they placed a mat between themselves and the child to block him from hitting them, and initiated the first of several physical holds. Each time he was released, he briefly calmed down but didn’t follow directions to sit still or stay in a designated spot, prompting a cycle: he would attempt to flee, staff would block him, the boy would resist, and staff would restrain him again, the report says.
About an hour in, while hiding in a locker, he asked to go home. A staff member moved him to a classroom, where he hid under a desk, retrieved rocks from his backpack, and threw them at staff, the report said. While the report described the projectiles as rocks, Emerson said her son had pebbles in his backpack.
Two hours in, staff called his parents. Even after he calmed down, they placed him in a seclusion room — referred to as a “quiet room” in the report — where they continued telling him to sit in a specific spot. When his father arrived, the boy walked out on his own, calm and cooperative.
Incidents like that continued for several more months for reasons that Emerson said did not warrant these measures: After he pulled books off shelves, punched a door, or refused to accompany staff to a quiet room, staff would put him in a physical hold or placed him in a room alone, according to a complaint Emerson filed with the district.
“I never condoned any of the behavior, whether he was throwing a book or whether he was yelling or running out of the classroom,” she said. “But he was not getting any education whatsoever last year. He was literally just going to school and being restrained and secluded.”
  Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, pictured here, is far from the only school restraining and secluding children, practices that Maine law said should be used only in emergency situations.

Frequent seclusions push an educator to quit
It’s not only students and their families who feel the trauma from restraints and seclusion. The educators who are told to put their hands on children feel it, too, several current and former teachers and education technicians told the Maine Morning Star.
Ashley Rose took a job as an ed tech at SeDoMoCha Elementary School in Dover-Foxcroft in August while working toward a degree in special education. But after months of witnessing staff placing students in empty rooms as they screamed and cried to be let out, she changed course.
In March, Rose switched her major, deciding she no longer wanted to become a teacher. On April 28, she resigned, writing to Superintendent Stacy Shorey that she had repeatedly raised concerns with supervisors about the school’s frequent use of seclusion, the lack of staff training on student behavior, and the absence of alternatives — without seeing meaningful change.
SeDoMoCha Elementary School has “quiet rooms” located within special education classrooms — which Rose described as 10-by-6-foot rooms with no windows. Some have benches and one light, while others are entirely empty, she said. All the doors have windows in them so staff can monitor students.
In her 10 years of working in special education, she has never seen such frequent use of quiet rooms, Rose said.
In December, Rose found herself participating in her first seclusion. The student she was working with wasn’t physically aggressive, just loud, and Rose’s plan had been to escort her into the special education classroom — not the quiet room — to help her calm down.
The student went with her voluntarily but was crying, she said. When they got to the classroom, another staff member who had worked at the school longer said it was part of that student’s behavior plan to go to the quiet room.
“That wasn’t my plan,” Rose said. “That room scares me just looking at it as an adult.”
As the student became more agitated, Rose said her own anxiety rose. If the student didn’t calm down, the other employee told Rose she had to shut the door. Rose complied, and then her colleague told her to hold the door shut with her foot to keep the student inside, she said.
Inside the room, the student began having what appeared to be an anxiety attack and threatened to break the window. She calmed down after about 20 minutes, and Rose let her out. Rose said she was not directed to file an incident report, nor was she told if someone else in the district did, despite the requirement in state law that districts document every seclusion.
Over the holiday break that followed, Rose said she had trouble sleeping. “All I can think about is the student I put in that room,” she said. “School should be their safe place, and these students were not feeling safe.”
Shorey, the superintendent, said staff members are required to report every incident, but she did not know about the particular incident Rose described. Special Education Director Sue Terrill said it’s possible that a staff member other than Rose wrote a report, but the district was unable to locate any documentation of that event.
The district trains employees in safety care — crisis management and prevention practices — Terrill said. It is open to other trainings, too, she said, including one that Rose brought to Terrill’s attention in February offered by the Maine nonprofit Lives in the Balance, which other districts have used to dramatically reduce their reliance on restraint and seclusion.
Quiet rooms present a gray area
Rose said she saw staff members keep students in seclusion rooms even when they were calm, using those same rooms for a variety of reasons beyond seclusion, which is banned or strictly regulated in at least seven states, according to the MOST Policy Initiative, a Missouri nonprofit. Maine came close to banning the rooms in 2021, but the final version of the law was amended to allow their use in emergencies.
Rose said she saw staff place students in quiet rooms to calm down after acting out, and then not allow them to exit for 20 minutes after they calmed down. If the seclusion happened at the end of the school day, sometimes the student would be expected to return to the quiet room the next day, she said.
Terrill recalled Rose raising this as an issue but denied keeping students in the rooms after they calmed down and no longer met the legal threshold for confinement.
But the district does use these rooms as timeout spaces, either by student choice or by staff direction, Terrill confirmed. Often, Terrill said, staff members are positioned outside the rooms, as they would be in a seclusion incident, but the student is typically free to leave the room, which is not the case in a seclusion.
Sometimes, the door is open, or a student can choose to shut the door with a staff member standing outside, she said.
“It can be the same room used if the student was in seclusion,” she said. “But if they’re taking a break because of something that happened, and that’s being used as a break space, the student might continue to work in there until they’re ready to go back to the classroom.”
Like RSU 68 in Dover-Foxcroft, districts across Maine also use seclusion rooms as quiet spaces, according to Ben Jones, a former Disability Rights Maine attorney who now works for Lives in the Balance.
“I think it’s actually more the rare case that the school is like, ‘We’re going to build this room and we’re going to call it the seclusion room, and it’s going to be used just for seclusion,’” he said.
If a student has voluntarily shut themselves in the seclusion room with a staff member outside and is free to go at any time, it would not count as seclusion under Maine law, he said. But if staff members ask students to stay in there to complete their work, as Rose described, whether it would count as a seclusion that districts are required to report to the state is “open to interpretation,” Jones said.
“The overall thing is, the kid is not learning, not in the classroom, in something that could easily turn into seclusion,” he said. “It’s inappropriate at best and potentially illegal if it’s an unrecorded seclusion.”
When are students and staff in ‘imminent danger’?
Education technicians like Rose — aides who often work with students one-on-one or in small groups — are often the ones handling student outbursts or potential violence, said Greg Kavanaugh, who spent 13 years working as an ed tech and special education teacher in Biddeford, Portland, and Yarmouth.
Ed techs are among the lowest-paid professionals in education, and often the least trained — including on behavior management techniques.
“They’re having to make good decisions about when to restrain, when to seclude, and their judgment is going to be really hard because they’re so stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid,” Kavanaugh said. “That just leads to more mistakes, more lapses in judgment.”
In his experience, Kavanaugh said, restraint and seclusion were consistently treated as last-resort measures — used only in extreme situations.
Staff received training on managing student behavior, they debriefed after restraints and seclusions, and they held regular conversations with parents, he said, which disability rights advocates recommend as best practices.
But working in a functional life skills program with students with moderate to severe disabilities, Kavanaugh said, deciding whether to restrain or seclude a child was never easy despite clear protocols in place. Even when a student threw a laptop across the room or hit him, he had to determine whether the behavior posed an imminent danger of serious injury that would require medical intervention beyond first aid — the standard in Maine law — and only intervene physically if it did. He also had to keep calm if students hit him, he said, because that still did not meet the legal standard.
Every time he did restrain or seclude a child, it stayed with him long after. He said he often questioned whether it had been the right call, thought about how families would respond, and considered the lasting effects the practice might have on the student — and on himself.
“Anytime there was a hold, a restraint or a seclusion, you’re taking that home, and you’re thinking about that kid when you’re at home, trying to move on with your day,” he said. “I’m a pretty strong-willed person, but there are plenty of times I would quietly be in tears, or going home and having an extra glass of wine, because I’m just not processing it well in the aftermath.”
Other students in the classroom witnessing these incidents are also traumatized, Kavanaugh said.
“You see the terror on their classmates’ faces, and you feel bad for the kid in a certain way because this is going to hurt their relationships,” he said.
But talking to parents afterward would always make him feel better, Kavanaugh said, because parents of students with disabilities are often dealing with similar behavior challenges at home.

District response to a parental complaint
Emerson, the parent in Ellsworth, complained to the school board, Superintendent Amy Boles, and the Maine Department of Education in August 2024, alleging that staff members had not met the legal threshold for using restraint and seclusion so often on her son.
Boles wrote back in October, saying in cases where Emerson’s son was hitting, scratching, and kicking staff, “it is my conclusion that active behavior like this toward another person does create an ‘imminent danger’ that the other person could be sufficiently injured that he or she may need more than ‘routine first aid.’”
“The incident may not in fact have caused an injury requiring that level of care, but a reasonable and prudent person could reasonably conclude that this could occur,” Boles wrote in her letter, reviewed by Maine Morning Star.
But the investigation the district launched in response to Emerson’s complaint found that staff had improperly restrained and secluded her son in at least five of the 18 incidents to which his mother objected. Some incident reports were also vaguely written, Boles wrote, which was the case for the three-hour incident in October 2023 — making it difficult to determine whether restraints and seclusion were warranted.
Nonetheless, Boles concluded in her letter to Emerson that all staff need training on the proper use of restraint and seclusion, and she agreed the district should rely on the practice less often.
Boles declined to comment on the investigation or specific incidents, but said district staff have undergone an initial training with Lives in the Balance, and followup trainings are planned.
“Behavior is an issue across the board. I mean, it’s skyrocketing everywhere. It’s not just Ellsworth,” she said. “But we’re working really hard to try to be preventative before it gets to that extreme state, trying to teach staff day-to-day strategies to prevent the behavior before it escalates.”
Emerson said her son is still visibly shaken every time he passes by the school, or even when someone mentions the word “school” around him.
On April 23, she testified at a public hearing, telling Maine lawmakers restraint and seclusion in public schools must stop. The day before, her son had said he was still afraid to go to school in person.
“His world has become so small since these events, he rarely leaves our home,” she said. “Everyone continues about their day, and yet I’m left to pick up the pieces.”

(Troy Bennett/Maine Morning Star)About a decade ago, a Maine school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district’s 500 or so special education students.
Those tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district’s special education director.

“We started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,” Hall said.
So in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish — and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset — the 2,350-student district’s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.

The Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75’s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion — when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics “are not effective in altering a student’s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,” according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.
The model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts — including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia — to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.
But despite that model’s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization’s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer.
Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly.
“Any one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn’t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,” Wilkinson said.
In response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.
“What works in Falmouth isn’t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that’s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,” Wilkinson said.
Since 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike.
The Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer.
“The mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,” she said.
Instead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.
“If a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we’re working with that student,” Hall said. “Once we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you’re way too late.”
Changing how schools think about student behavior
The founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.
Greene’s approach helps schools address what he calls “concerning behaviors” without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can’t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.
“I get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they’re communicating the exact same thing — they’re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,” he said.
Rather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students’ skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.
“The problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who’s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,” he said.
Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.
One district that’s advocating to loosen the state’s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene’s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.
“Given that we’ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we’re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,” said Angela Hardy, the district’s director of curriculum and instruction.
In the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents.
Classroom design as prevention
A special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies.
“It’s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,” said Lapointe, who is now the district’s elementary special education coordinator. “That leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead — and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.”
Classroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out — and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.
She started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn’t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.
“I’ve still had kids climb on tables, and I’ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?” she said. “Is it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.”
The other piece was training ed techs — aides who often work one-on-one with students — in the new approach.
“Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,” Lapointe said. “The way you talk to kids matters a lot.”










Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.

If a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they’re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: “What can I tolerate? Why can’t they leave the classroom? What’s the worst that’s going to happen?”
“The level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that’s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,” Lapointe said. “You must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you’re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?”
That’s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.
“Teachers or ed techs will report, ‘We’ve been safety-care trained, we’ve had de-escalation training’ … all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,” Wilkinson said. “That means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they’re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.”
Even in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn’t complete. Lapointe said it’s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.
A new approach
The Topsham-area district combines Greene’s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS — a research-based model used in schools across the country that’s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave.
This is how the combination of the two models could look.
In the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene’s approach would come into play if a student can’t keep quiet in the library, she said.
It may be that the child can’t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.
Moving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.
“Instead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can’t, you try to figure out what’s behind the behavior,” Hall said. “We still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren’t, ‘We’re going to put you in a seclusion room.’ Because that’s not a consequence, that’s a crisis response.”

When the Neighborhood Health workers first met this homeless man in Hartford, they weren’t sure he would be able to get around on his own again, or even if he’d survive. The flesh was rotting off his feet, and his tendons were exposed from frostbite.
But last week, squeezed into the back of the former ambulance they use to get around the city, they were watching a video of the man taking some of his first steps on new prosthetic legs. They craned their necks to see their colleague’s phone. 
They could see the patient smiling, hesitantly pushing a walker as he meandered down a hallway.
The man had been living on the streets of Hartford over the winter and couldn’t get into a shelter. As the homeless population has risen, shelter space has become more scarce and scenarios like his more common. 
The Neighborhood Health workers, employees of Hartford HealthCare, cheered when they saw him walking with the prosthetics. Then they climbed out of the ambulance, grabbing gloves on the way. They had more patients to help, more people with complex health care issues like his.

Launched in 2021, the team drives a refurbished ambulance to shelters or encampments, then provides health care on-site for people experiencing homelessness. They’re out nearly every day. 
In recent months, as more people, particularly seniors, have lost their housing, health workers are finding that the cases they handle are more complicated. People often have multiple diagnoses, and with older age groups, there are often health complications that make the illnesses or injuries harder to treat. Sometimes, conversations are veering to end-of-life care.
These conversations between health care professionals and patients are poignant as state lawmakers debate funding for the systems that offer shelter and other services for the unhoused population. The providers that would benefit from the state support — none affiliated with Hartford Healthcare — could help prevent many of the injuries the nurses see in the first place, health care workers said.
Homelessness in Connecticut increased by about 13% from 2023 to 2024. Recent data from the state’s response system shows that nearly 6,000 people are experiencing homelessness, and nearly 1,000 are living outside instead of in shelters. Providers have asked for $33.5 million for homelessness services to help with the increased population, but most budget proposals so far have suggested they’ll get only a fraction of that money.
“When you think about the fact that the average life expectancy of an unhoused individual is about 50 years, a 60-year-old is like dealing with a 90-year-old that’s housed, so these individuals are really sick and complex,” said Kelly Toth, system director of the Neighborhood Health Operations.

In the case of the older man with frostbite, workers did the best they could for him, bandaging and cleaning his wounds. But within days, his legs had to be amputated in the hospital. Soon after, another problem presented itself.
“They finished the acute stuff, but there was nowhere to send him, because no nursing home wanted to take him, because he’s homeless” and unable to pay, Toth said. “So they were going to discharge him to the street with no legs.”
It took 24 hours and more than a dozen health care workers, but Toth and her team helped find a place for him in a rehabilitation facility. He’s doing physical therapy while he learns to use his new legs.
The Neighborhood Health program started in 2021 with funding from Hartford HealthCare, grants from organizations such as the Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, Farmington Bank Community Foundation and TD Bank Charitable Foundation, as well as private donations.
The team works out of an ambulance that’s been retrofitted to allow for more seating and storage. The team offers a range of medical aid, from eye care to wound care and overdose prevention and treatment. Part of their goal is to keep health problems from getting worse — and even harder to treat — down the road.
Earlier this month, they gathered in a circle at the Hartford office to talk about the day ahead before clambering aboard the rig.
“We’re going to go to Pope Park first. There’s someone who got a gunshot wound in November and never followed up,” Toth said.

David Mingolelli, a physician’s assistant and street medicine lead, said they might see a patient there who has been getting treatment for an opioid use disorder. They have high hopes that he’ll get clean and plan to bring him another regiment of medication for the addiction.
Another nurse told the group that a service provider at Hands on Hartford, a nonprofit that offers housing and support services, told her they had a lot of folks who needed wound care, and everyone nodded as they packed up the ambulance to head out into the field for the day.
Throughout the day, the staff recalled the stories of different people they’ve treated: cuts on a man who was living in a dumpster and was accidentally picked up by a dump truck, a man on dialysis who needed help getting follow-up appointments, a woman who had leg surgery months ago and never got her stitches out.
Toth spent hours removing that woman’s stitches and staples while sitting on a milk crate in a public park. She fears the woman will get an infection.
“I told her, ‘Not only could you lose your leg, you could lose your life,’” Toth said.

End-of-life care
Two months ago, the team started working with inpatient referrals — meeting with people who come into the hospital for treatment but don’t have a place to go after. Sometimes, like in the case of the man who lost both legs, they try to find a short-term rehabilitation or nursing facility that can admit them. In other cases, they just make sure to follow up with them at their encampments or shelters.
In the coming months, they hope to expand to provide mobile medicine in the eastern part of the state.
Many of the people they treat don’t have watches or phones, Toth said. They don’t know what day it is or what time, and even if they did, transportation to get to follow-up appointments is a challenge.
They’re seeing more seniors, Toth added. The latest state data shows that more than 1,300 unhoused people were over 55, up from 800 last year.
It’s been a concern for the past couple of years as rents have risen and people on fixed incomes struggle to keep up. Toth said many of their patients also struggle to access shelters or warming centers in the winter because of mobility issues.
One warming center in Hartford is on the second floor of a building with no accessible entrance, she said. And sometimes, shelters only have top bunks available.
“It’s hard. Sometimes you feel like you’re trying to boil the ocean, but you just take it one visit and one patient at a time,” she said.
The growing number of seniors also means she’s having more conversations about end-of-life care. In one case, a patient with HIV was in and out of the hospital every couple of days. In another, an older man broke his femur and got an infection that could only be treated with IV antibiotics. The patients weren’t sure about entering the hospital full time, which is what their care required, Toth said.
“We need to figure out how we can support him out here the way he wants and have him still have control, do it his way, have dignity,” she said.
She said she’s asking questions she hasn’t had to in the past, such as: If we find you unconscious, do you want CPR? Do you want us to put a tube down your throat to breathe for you? Where do you want to be when you die?
“Within the last month, we’ve had multiple conversations popping up,” Toth said. “They don’t want to be in the hospital for six weeks for IV antibiotics, or they don’t want to undergo surgery. That’s OK, and I respect that, but it’s thinking about how we support them out here and make sure they’re comfortable.
“They can die with dignity and they can die where they feel safe, and if safe is a park bench that’s your home, that’s your spot. So it’s a crappy realization, but I think this is going to be something we are seeing more and more now that the population is getting older and sicker.”
Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, said her organization is focused on helping people get housed and increasing funding for the homeless response system. For years, providers have said they don’t have enough resources to meet the need.
“For people who are outside, you know, their mortality is increased exponentially,” Fox said. “People age so much faster because it is so stressful to be outside and to be unhoused.”

The budget request
As homelessness has increased over the past few years in Connecticut, more people are also living outside.
Homeless service providers, such as overnight shelters, this legislative session asked the state for $33.5 million.
The providers’ request includes $7.8 million for prevention, including legal and social services for people facing eviction, and flexible funding for things like rent aid, utility bills or other expenses that could help keep people housed.
It also seeks $19.5 million in crisis response, which includes annual funding for cold weather emergencies, and $6.2 million to increase the number of people getting housing vouchers through the state’s Rental Assistance program.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget proposal would have added rental assistance vouchers for senior citizens and people with disabilities, as well as a $5 million allocation for eviction prevention and additional funding for the homeless system’s response to cold weather. 
But that $5 million was set to come from the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee budget. The proposal has been controversial among lawmakers and advocates who say the state shouldn’t dip into that money for anything other than its intended purpose.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a press briefing last week that the details of the budget are still being worked out. But the legislature and governor are faced with difficult funding choices, as many programs say they need more money.
Lamont has favored a fiscally conservative approach to pay down debt. But that’s become more difficult to maintain as state officials grapple with federal budget cuts and which holes the state will fill.
The Appropriations Committee proposed spending less than Lamont did: $3.5 million for cold weather services.
Fox said that simply isn’t enough.
“We asked for $33.5 million to prevent homelessness, to respond to homelessness when it arises, and then to house individuals and ensure that they’re stable,” Fox said. “And it’s exactly still what we need. We need every dollar. And when we look at people with complex medical needs, or people who are literally losing their limbs because they aren’t able to get into a warming center, those are our neighbors, and that’s the lens that we look at this from.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers announced the launch of the Homelessness Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers focused on improving services for the unhoused population. Caucus chair Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk, said he’s still talking to other lawmakers, trying to get them more money.
“We’ve just been trying to spread the word, putting a lot of pressure, not just on the governor’s office, but each one of these reps — you guys represent a population that is homeless in your communities,” Roberts said.

Housing Committee ranking member and Homelessness Caucus member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, called into question the state’s priorities. It’s been hard to get enough funding for homeless services, he said, and he thinks the state wastes money on other programs.
“These are the people that are the most vulnerable people in the entire state,” Scott said. “If we’re not here to help those folks, what are we doing here?” 
Fox added that putting people in shelters and preventing some of these medical needs will likely save the state money in the long-term by keeping them out of emergency rooms or urgent care.
That’s one of the goals of the Hartford HealthCare team as well. In addition to medical care, they carry supplies to take care of people’s basic needs. They keep Slim Jims and mini muffins in the ambulance, as well as a couple of stuffed animals in case they come across any children.
During the recent trip earlier this month, Talia Neves, a nurse with the Hartford Neighborhood Health team, examined one man’s tent and sleeping bag. They were wearing out, and she helped him make plans to get new supplies.
Two people with tents facing one another, and a clothesline stretched between two trees, needed new prescriptions for medication as well as treatment for a wound.

First Helene, then Milton lashed Florida’s Gulf Coast with deadly flooding and destructive winds, as well as damage from unprecedented tornadoes generated by the second storm. The toll of two major hurricanes in such a short amount of time has left people in the Sunshine State reeling and communities in ruins, with barely any time to recover in between.
Few parts of the southeastern region were spared from this one-two punch of tropical weather. Only a week and a half before Milton, entire communities from Virginia to the Carolinas were left unrecognizable by the widespread wrath of Helene. Some were unreachable for days after being cut off by mudslides and washed-out roads and bridges. The catastrophic hurricane also knocked out power and cell service for millions of people, leaving residents in a virtual black hole as they frantically tried to reach their loved ones and even making it difficult to call 911.
Responding to historic disasters like these requires a massive relief effort comprised of agencies from all levels of government, along with nonprofits and mutual aid from utilities across the country. Among the thousands who didn’t hesitate to answer the call for help: dozens of Eversource crews from Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire who traveled to storm-ravaged Virginia to help turn the lights back on after Helene. 
In today’s world, staying connected is more than a convenience. It has become a fundamental part of how we work, travel, and engage with others. From remote professionals managing business on the go to families keeping in touch across cities, the expectation for seamless and reliable mobile access has never been greater.
The evolution of digital connectivity has shaped how we interact with technology. Mobile service is no longer just about making calls. It powers everything from virtual collaboration to entertainment and navigation. The shift toward flexible and adaptive mobile access reflects the changing demands of users who rely on their devices as essential tools for daily life.

The Demand for Seamless Transitions
One of the most significant transformations in mobile technology has been the push for smoother connectivity between home Wi-Fi and mobile data. Consumers expect their connection to move with them, whether stepping outside for a walk, commuting, or traveling across the country.
The rise of nationwide 5G networks has made this transition easier, allowing people to work remotely, stream content, and stay in touch without interruptions. As the workforce embraces hybrid models and businesses expand their digital reach, the ability to move effortlessly between networks has become crucial.
Connectivity should adapt to users, not the other way around. People expect mobile service that enhances mobility, instead of restricting them with outdated models or rigid contracts.
Flexibility in Mobile Plans to Fit Real-Life Usage
Traditional mobile contracts have often forced users into standardized tiers that may not align with their habits. Mobile needs vary widely. Some people use their phones only for essentials, while others rely on constant data access to stay productive.
Flexible mobile options are gaining traction. Pay-as-you-go models allow occasional users to pay only for what they need, while unlimited plans provide freedom for those who depend on continuous connectivity for work and travel. This shift represents a larger movement toward customizable digital experiences, where technology adjusts to individual lifestyles rather than locking users into predefined choices.
Why Seamless Integration Matters
For many, home internet and mobile service are no longer separate. They work together to create a unified digital experience. Whether joining a virtual meeting from a laptop, switching to a mobile hotspot, or streaming content across devices, users expect a simple transition between networks without disruption.
Mobile service providers now recognize that strong coverage is not enough. Consumers want ease of use, cost-effective bundling options, and integration that makes managing their digital experience simpler. As Wi-Fi-to-cell transitions become more reliable, people can move between environments without interruptions. This has become especially important for remote work, travel, and day-to-day communication.
Security and Reliability in a Mobile-First World
As digital interactions grow, mobile security has become increasingly important. Whether working remotely, conducting transactions, or managing sensitive information, protecting data on the go is a priority.
Consumers expect mobile providers to invest in privacy safeguards, encrypted connections, and network reliability. The rise of predictive troubleshooting and real-time customer support reinforces confidence in secure connectivity. Mobile service has become more than a tool for communication. It is now a critical part of both personal and professional life.
The Future of Mobile Flexibility
The way people communicate, work, and engage with digital technology continues to evolve. Hybrid workplaces are expanding, streaming services are growing, and connectivity plays a larger role in daily routines. Expectations for adaptive, user-focused mobile experiences will only increase.
This transformation is not about making mobile access more complicated. The goal is to make it effortless, reliable, and aligned with real-world lifestyles. People no longer want to adjust their habits around mobile plans. Instead, they expect providers to offer solutions that work for them, giving them mobility without limits.
A New Standard for Connectivity
In a digital world that never stops moving, flexibility in mobile service is no longer a luxury. It has become a necessity. As expectations shift and innovations bring new possibilities, seamless, integrated, and adaptive connectivity is setting the standard for how people stay connected, whether at home, at work, or on the move.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Featured-Image_Cox-Mobile-771x578.jpg,,,2025-05-25 05:02:07.316359

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Jails are hard places made necessary by people like Ernest Hoefgen.
Few are likely to remember Hoefgen now, but back in September 1943 the 31-year-old escaped from the city jail at Cottonwood Falls. He’d been picked up for assault, according to newspaper accounts, and was using an alias. In reality, Hoefgen was an escapee from the Texas state prison at Huntsville, where he had been serving a life sentence for murder.
Stick with me, because this is not a story about a murder that took place eight decades ago, but about due process in America in 2025. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the Constitutional guarantee of due process, which means everyone should have access to fair and adequate legal proceedings when the government threatens to deprive us of life, liberty or property. This is regardless of what Kristi Noem, director of Homeland Security, may say it and habeas corpus are.
Our thinking about courts and jails and their role in American society has been shaped by Hoefgen and other criminals like him. The reason “In Cold Blood” stays with us, apart from Truman Capote’s writing, is that it’s a story of a farm family in western Kansas who were murdered in a sensational way. It leaves us asking, why?
Movies, books and television also tend to blur our thinking about who is a criminal and who is not. If you’re in jail — or a detention center, as they’re likely called now — you must be a criminal, right? Well, no. There are plenty of people being processed in our jails right now who have committed no crime but who have violated relatively minor civil codes, comparable to getting a ticket from the city for the height of your grass. But unlike policing lawn care, there’s a gold rush related to immigration enforcement. There’s a billion-dollar detention industry hungry to fill beds with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, and civil liberties are being eroded in the process.
ICE doesn’t like to talk about how much it pays facilities, or to have any of its contractors talk about how much they make per day for each detainee. Apparently, the first rule of ICE club is don’t talk about ICE club.
But let’s talk first about how jails are supposed to function.
In 1938, Hoefgen killed carpenter George Richet with a hatchet from Richet’s own toolbox. Hoefgen and a teenage girlfriend, Sylvia Phipps, were hitchhiking near Wichita Falls when the carpenter gave them a lift, according to the Associated Press. Hoefgen later told investigators he didn’t know why he killed Richet, who still had $8 in cash when his body was found by railway workers. The case remained unsolved for two years.
Both Hoefgen and Phipps were later picked up on forgery charges at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, found guilty, and sentenced to prison. In 1940, Phipps told the matron at the women’s reformatory she wanted to talk to investigators because she had witnessed the killing of Richet in Texas. When questioned, Hoefgen confessed.
We know all this about Hoefgen because of due process. The evidence against him was carefully detailed in court filings, he had advice from lawyers, and his court proceedings were open to the public and the press.
Hoefgen was sent to Huntsville to serve his life sentence, but he escaped — twice. After the second escape, he ran back to his home state of Kansas, where he married a local girl named Pauline and got into trouble at Cottonwood Falls. After escaping from the city jail, he stole another car and picked up a hitchhiker, 18-year-old Kansas State University student Bruce Smoll. When Smoll became suspicious, according to a United Press story, Hoefgen shot him to death. Rabbit hunters found the body a month later in a cornfield near Peabody, about 40 miles southwest of Cottonwood Falls.
Based on a hunch from Smoll’s father that Hoefgen may have been involved in his son’s death, and tips from Pauline’s parents, investigators found Hoefgen living in Denver and returned him to Marion County, where he was charged with Smoll’s murder.
Hoefgen’s story is full of odd details that, if you put them in a movie, would shatter the audience’s suspension of disbelief. When he and Phipps were in the county jail at Gering, Nebraska, awaiting trial on the forgery charges, they allegedly hatched a ridiculous jailbreak plot by hiding notes to one another in bananas and tomatoes. My interest in Hoefgen is because his last murderous jail escape began in Cottonwood Falls.
The Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls has received attention lately as being the last and largest ICE-contracted jail facility in Kansas. The 148-bed facility was built to turn a profit for this central Kansas county of 2,500, and it has been mostly full since the mass deportations began under the Trump administration. Back in 2021 and again earlier this month, I wrote about my discomfort with a picturesque Kansas county profiting from the misery of ICE detentions. Four years ago, the rate paid per day of inmate detention was $62.
Curious about how much Chase County is now receiving to house detainees, I filed a Kansas Open Records Act request for the facility contract. I was told to take a hike.
“Due to being a federal contracted agency,” Sheriff Jacob Welsh wrote in an email, “there are contract restrictions which I am not allowed to disclose any information about the contract.”
Requests, he said, were to be sent directly to ICE.
Welsh did not respond to a request to cite the KORA exemption he felt applied in the situation or to provide the language in the federal contract that forbade him from discussing the contract.
I did contact ICE for the contract but received an automated out-of-office reply from spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe. The email said she would respond when she returned “Monday, May 21.” As of Friday, I had not received a response from O’Keefe or any other ICE representative.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment lawyer at Lawrence, told me that Welsh’s responses showed a lack of concern for open records and state law.
“The sheriff’s response violates the Kansas Open Records Act,” Kautsch said, “because he does not ‘cite the specific provision of law’ authorizing denial of the request,” which he must do under Kansas law.
There are legitimate exemptions to KORA that allow the use of federal law to deny requests, such as how public universities can deny some requests for student information under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
“If the sheriff insists on denying the request based on guidance he’s received from the federal government, he must come clear to the public and cite that authority, as KORA requires,” Kautsch said. “He also would need to explain why he is unable to produce even a redacted version of the requested records.”
Welsh’s response raises concerns about open government.
“These circumstances suggest, at a minimum, that the sheriff is indifferent to open records laws, attention to detail, or both,” Kautsch said. “That conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the inmate information portal on the sheriff’s website says access to records held by the Chase County Jail is purportedly governed by the ‘Kentucky Open Records Act.’ Their office is in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. If the sheriff’s office can’t be bothered to properly identity its own state law on its own website, perhaps it is to be expected that it wouldn’t know how to respond to a KORA request, either.”
Why Kentucky?
I don’t know. Perhaps the template for the inmate portal was borrowed from the Muhlenberg County Detention Center.
To get a better understanding of what ICE detainees at Chase County and elsewhere go through, I contacted Kansas City, Missouri, immigration attorney Michael Sharma-Crawford.
For years, Sharma-Crawford told me, Chase County was the only immigration detention facility for most of Kansas and Missouri. There are now more counties being contracted, he said, especially in Missouri. In Kansas, for-profit CoreCivic is attempting to repurpose a shuttered prison in Leavenworth for ICE detention, but it has faced legal challenges and has not yet opened.
The issue with the current wave of detainments, Sharma-Crawford said, is the speed at which deportations are being carried out and the difficulty in tracking cases through the system. Migrants are typically given a handful of documents upon their arrest containing the specifics against them. Without access to those papers, it’s difficult for an immigration attorney to evaluate a case, he said, or to track a migrant’s case online. In many instances, he said, jails meant to house criminal detainees are unprepared to deal with civil immigration cases.
He commended Chase County on being willing to fax immigration documents to attorneys, while allowing the detainees to keep the originals, and to facilitate attorney-client phone calls.
“I’d take 12 Chase Counties compared to other facilities,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Access to legal counsel is an important Sixth Amendment right, he said, and this is especially important when deportation may now occur three weeks or less from the time of arrest.
“If you’re from Mexico, you have to move quickly,” he advised. “If you don’t know what your status is, you should talk to an immigration attorney.”
He also suggested having important documents, like birth certificates, at the ready, and being prepared to seek a second legal opinion when necessary.
Sharma-Crawford said the immigration system was broken and that things were building to a chaotic crescendo. The administration’s goal, he said, is to artificially clog the system and then claim it is impractical to give every detainee a hearing. But as late Justice Antonin Scalia said, due process applies to everyone.
It’s something average Americans should take to heart, no matter where they were born. It’s something that is being lost among the current rhetoric about crime and immigration. The vast majority of ICE detainees, he said, are held on civil charges.
“I don’t defend people against criminal charges,” Sharma-Crawford said.
If we don’t protect the due process rights of migrants now, he said, we might be denying due process for everyday civil infractions tomorrow, such as allowing your grass to grow too high.
“At some point, this leads to abbreviated trials” and other erosions of due process, he said.
The prospect of CoreCivic opening a thousand-bed facility at Leavenworth terrifies him. The previous prison operated by CoreCivic in Leavenworth was described as a “hell hole” of abuse and mismanagement. The city of Leavenworth sued to stop the facility from being reopened as an ICE detention facility, but on Thursday a federal judge dismissed the case.
While Chase County did not provide answers to my questions about how lucrative its ICE contract was, a 2024 report by the American Immigration Council provides some clues. It estimated the average daily rate for detention to be $237 per person, with single adults spending an average of 55 days in detention. The rate for Chase County, of course, might differ. But with nobody willing to talk, who knows?
Communities such as Cottonwood Falls and Leavenworth must weigh the price of monetizing ICE detainment in the age of Trump against the fundamental American values of fairness and compassion. Leavenworth wouldn’t directly share in the per-day rate as Chase County does, but there is the lure of jobs and economic development. It is a devil’s bargain, a Faustian pact, the civic equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.
Back in 1943, Hoefgen pleaded guilty in Marion County District Court to the murder of K-State student Smoll. He was sentenced to death.
Hoefgen was hanged shortly after 1 a.m. Friday, March 10, 1944, on a newly constructed gallows in a warehouse at the Kansas State Penitentiary at Lansing. His last meal had been fried chicken. He declined requests to speak to reporters and showed little emotion as he was led up the 13 fated steps, an eyewitness from the Associated Press reported. Hoefgen was the first person to be executed by Kansas since 1870.
The death penalty is currently legal in Kansas, but it hasn’t been used since 1965. The most notorious murderers executed at the Lansing gallows were “In Cold Blood” killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smith.
While it’s easy to see the story of Hoefgen as that of a criminal who got what he deserved, it’s also a saga of Constitutional due process. He was repeatedly brought before the courts in the downward spiral of his life, afforded lawyers, treated humanely and even given fruit while in custody. Whether you agree with capital punishment or not, there was no abbreviation of justice.
County jails were typically places where criminal defendants were sent to await their trials or where those convicted of misdemeanor crimes served sentences of a year or less. They were not places for defendants in civil cases. Criminal cases can result in punishment that includes jail time, while civil cases typically involve settling disputes.
The migrants now being rushed through the deportation pipeline deserve the full protection of due process. If we deny them legal representation and access to courts by accelerating their cases through a broken system, we are betraying core American values. We risk turning justice into an unthinking machine run by idealogues and fueled by the monetization of detainment.
It is either due process for all, or due process for none.

You know what TOD is, right?  Transit Oriented Development… building homes and offices near mass transit facilities.  Well, I’m going to suggest you think about TOR… Transit Oriented Recreation.


Did you know you can travel to many state parks and beaches by train and a connecting bus shuttle?  Details on this year’s program are still to come, but the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have partnered since 2021 to offer ParkConneCT from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
In years past, beach and park shuttles meeting in-coming trains have been free on weekends and holidays, taking you to places like Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden or Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison.
While many state parks close their gates on weekends when their parking lots are full of cars, the shuttle buses can still deliver you to Mother Nature without the hassles.
The state’s modest marketing efforts to attract tourists seem to be working as the number of visitors was up 2% last year.  Officials say tourism brings Connecticut $18.5 billion each year… more than what’s seen in Maine, which bills itself as “Vacationland.”
And it’s clearly our beaches that are a main draw.  Who needs to endure I-95 when you can take the train to visit…
…. Sherwood Island State Park in Westport:  Just take Metro-North to Westport Station and grab the Sherwood Island Shuttle from the station to the park to enjoy swimming, picnicking and great views of LI Sound.

… Silver Sands State Park in Milford:  Metro-North gets you to Milford Station where a walk or bike ride to the beach presents newly refurbished boardwalks, pristine beaches and bird-watching spots.
… or Bluff Point State Park in Groton:  Take Shore Line East or Amtrak to New London Station, then grab the SEAT (Southeast Area Transit) Route 11 bus to the beach where you can enjoy walks along the coast, biking and fishing.
Beyond TOR, how about TOE…. Transit Oriented Entertainment?
You wouldn’t think of driving to New York City to see a Knicks or Rangers game. You’d take the train, right? Well, you can take Metro-North directly to Yankee Stadium, too.
…Or to Bridgeport to see Ringo Starr or Jerry Seinfeld at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater… also walking distance from Amtrak and the Port Jefferson Ferry.
Going to see a play at The Shubert in New Haven or Andrea Bocelli at the XL Center in Hartford? Ditch the car and try mass transit.
And if you’re a rail fan, visit the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat by training to Old Saybrook and hopping into a cab for the quick ride back into history.
If you’re city-bound, check out Metro-North’s “MTA Away” packages… train and event tickets, often at a discount… for venues both in New York City and the ‘burbs. You can go star gazing or catch an outdoor concert in Forest Hills without a car.
Whatever your destination for summer fun, think twice before enduring the traffic and maybe consider taking mass transit.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CT-park-connect-1024x442.jpg,,,2025-05-25 05:02:07.316359

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)TRENTON, N.J. – The U.S. government has sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson and Hoboken – and their elected officials – for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
Prosecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.
“The United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,” the lawsuit states. “While states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.”
The complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and the cities’ council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey’s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.
Baraka blasted the latest prosecution as “absurd.”
“We are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,” he said in a statement. “Nothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.”
Fulop said he would not be “bullied” and vowed to fight the feds.
“Jersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city — I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,” he said. “Here is the truth: Jersey City’s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.”
And Sayegh dismissed the complaint as “a frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.”
“We will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson’s expense,” Sayegh said.
Bhalla also said his city “will not back down.”
“The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,” he said.
In the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring “otherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.”
Prosecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump’s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit “even the most basic cooperation with federal officials” and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.
“These efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,” the complaint states.
The complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.
“Such discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,” the complaint says.
The complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.
Jail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka’s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.
Immigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds’ attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities’ policies don’t violate federal law but instead “reflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.” She urged the cities to resist caving to federal “bullying.”
“Over the last few months, the Trump Administration’s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey — first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,” Torres said in a statement. “It is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A group of 19 community organizations have joined forces to push for oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee. Together the groups signed an open letter addressed to the city’s common council, asking it to adopt a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinance.
The measure would require existing surveillance technologies used by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) to receive a public hearing and be subject to approval by the Milwaukee Common Council.  The ordinance would also require the department to produce an annual report of surveillance gear. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“The proliferation of surveillance technology by the Milwaukee Police Department has occurred with virtually no transparency, no opportunities for community input and — without a real opportunity to reject surveillance techs or advocate for critical guardrails — presents significant threats to civil rights and civil liberties that hurts us all but disproportionately impact communities of color, queer communities, people seeking reproductive healthcare, immigrant communities, people fleeing violence, and low-income communities,” the coalition states in its letter. 
“While we trust our local elected officials in Milwaukee, in light of the current political climate and the uncertainty surrounding future administrations at both the federal and state levels (both in Wisconsin and in other states), it is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the letter adds.
CCOPS ordinances have already passed in 26 cities nationwide, and calls to rein in the flow and development of police surveillance technologies have grown in recent years in Milwaukee. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin began advocating for CCOPS ordinances in the Badger State, prompted by a lack of discussion on the issue and the impending Republican National Convention during the summer of 2024. 
As with the 2020 Democratic National Convention four years earlier, the RNC brought with it an influx of new equipment that allowed MPD to augment its surveillance network. Before the DNC the police department upgraded its mobile phone surveillance gear, expanded a camera network capable of using automatic license plate reader technology, and purchased vans equipped with cameras and drones. The RNC likewise opened the door for a new open source intelligence software, growing MPD’s social media surveillance capabilities. 
 
CCOPS Coalition Letter to Common Council
 
During the summer of 2020, many people who joined protests following the death of George Floyd witnessed these technologies, and reported suspicions that they were being monitored. As time passed, investigations revealed that local police departments monitored social media closely and drew information from confidential databases, with one agency funneling much of what it’d learned into a “target list” of nearly 200 people. The list had been shared with dozens of local, state, and federal agencies from Milwaukee to Kenosha. 
Since then more attention has been focused on intelligence units such as the MPD’s fusion center, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s “MATRIX Group”, and on technologies including drones, wiretap devices, gunshot detection sensors like Shotspotter, and spyware. More recently, Milwaukee residents have begun to express concerns about MPD’s plans to acquire facial recognition technology.

The accumulation of these issues spurred the group of 19 community organizations to sign the letter calling for CCOPS. The coalition includes Planned Parenthood, Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), the ACLU of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO), Voces de la Frontera Action, ComForce, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County League of Women Voters and others.  
The letter states that “policies are increasingly enacted, and local governments and their surveillance mechanisms will likely be used to target individuals seeking or providing these services. This scenario is particularly alarming given that Black, Brown, Muslim, queer, low-income, and immigrant communities are already disproportionately affected by law enforcement practices.” 
The letter suggests the stage is being set to repeat law enforcement spying scandals from the 1960s and ‘70s.
“Without robust oversight, we risk a resurgence of COINTELPRO-like tactics, where surveillance was used to suppress political dissent and target minority groups, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,” the letter states. “At a minimum, people who live, work, visit, or attend school in Milwaukee deserve to know if and how they’re being surveilled and who has access to that surveillance data.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2403-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-24 11:04:53.093139

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
  Cash cow 

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
  David vs. Goliath 

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.




States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much (help) coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“(States) are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
 

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
  State solutions 

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In November of 1976, after graduating from high school I went to the polls, and along with more than 75,000 Alaskans, voted YES on Proposition 2; this vote created Alaska’s Permanent Fund (PF). It continues to amaze me that more than 30,000 Alaskans voted against this measure.
We were blessed to have wise leaders who had the foresight back in 1976 to ask Alaskans if we should save a portion of our non-renewable resource; making it a renewable resource in the corpus of the PF.
The vote on Proposition 2 has created enormous wealth for Alaska and is the envy of other states. Today, Alaska’s PF and Earnings Reserve Account (ERA) has over $80 billion and is being managed and invested by experienced financial professionals. 
In addition to the deposits discussed above, the Legislature with the support of the Governor has deposited billions more into the fund’s corpus and appropriated hundreds of millions more in inflation proofing deposits to maintain the value of the PF.
The PF consists of two separate, but related accounts; the corpus or principle of the PF and the ERA, which receives earnings and realized gains from the PF investments. The corpus of the fund is constitutionally protected. The ERA is not; it can be appropriated — spent — with a simple majority vote of the legislature.
Senate Joint Resolution 14 currently resides in the Senate Finance Committee and proposes to ask Alaskans to combine Alaska’s PF and the ERA into one account. Simply put, this resolution proposes two changes: 1) the balance of the ERA shall be deposited in the corpus and become part of the PF principle and 2) the Legislature MAY appropriate from the PF an amount that is NOT more than 5%. 
Part 2 is particularly important. Currently the Legislature is withdrawing 5% to meet the public’s needs and balance the state budget. There is growing concern with falling oil prices, dwindling savings accounts, and few, if any, revenue options, that the Legislature will move to withdraw more than 5% to meet current needs. Placing the 5% withdrawal limit in the constitution will protect the remaining realized earnings in the corpus/principal of the PF and provide a known revenue stream for sound fiscal policy planning.
I believe that if the Legislature passes SJR14 as soon as possible, it would allow Alaskans to debate this important issue.
The Board of Trustees of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. has recommended combining the ERA with the corpus of the PF. As a former legislator and a former Senate Finance committee co-chair, I have come to trust the knowledge of the staff at the APFC and value the experience and recommendations of the members of the Board of Trustees.
The Senate Finance Committee sponsor statement for SJR 14 says it best: “Consolidating the two accounts follows globally recognized best practices for endowments and trusts. A single-fund model ensures all earnings are retained and reinvested within the fund, eliminating the need for inflation-proofing, and the endowment model structure guarantees an annual, sustainable POMV transfer. Additionally, constitutionalizing the draw protects the Permanent Fund, preventing the legislature from making ad hoc draws on the Fund.”
As a more “mature” woman, retired, with decades of work experience and community service I support combining the corpus of the PF and the ERA. 
Given the opportunity, I will vote YES on a constitutional amendment, to secure the PF for future generations of Alaskans and provide a sustainable and predictable revenue stream for our state.

Elevators were scorched. Conveyor belts collapsed. Metal doors melted. As smoke filled the sky, employees scrambled to escape. One dialed 911.
“The plant’s on fire,” he hurriedly breathed.
“Is everybody out of there?” The dispatcher asked.
“Working on it.”
Local fire crews extinguished the blaze at the Archer Daniels Midland plant about three hours later. Equipment failure likely created a spark. But the product upon which ADM built an empire was most responsible for the destruction: grain.
Processing grain generates a highly explosive byproduct, dust. Industry guidelines recommend, and experts encourage, that companies install machines to capture airborne dust and routinely clean dusty areas. A few days after the explosion, ADM assured the community it was qualified to handle the emergency. “Safety is always our top priority,” a spokesperson told the Fremont Tribune. “ADM has extensive processes and procedures in place.”
A federal safety inspector found a different story.
About two weeks after the explosion, the inspector arrived and immediately spotted the problem: Dust-coated walls and pipes. As the inspector collected samples, the plant manager grew irate.
“I know I have a dust problem,” the plant manager confided.
Near the top of the Fortune 500, with annual profits exceeding several billion dollars each year, ADM has long dominated American grain processing. It underpins the agriculture and food industries, producing feed for livestock and artificial sweeteners for Coca-Cola. It has touted its safety record, and it recently highlighted that it was named “one of America’s most responsible companies.”
However, despite its vast resources and awareness of the risks, ADM has failed to prevent a series of recent grain explosions, according to interviews with experts and a review of federal, state, and local records obtained by Investigate Midwest.
Disregarding industry best practices and government warnings, the company has allowed dust to accumulate to unsafe levels, has failed to maintain equipment designed to prevent explosions properly, and has not developed procedures for safely removing dust.
In total, one person has died and 15 employees and first-responders have suffered life-changing injuries.
The death occurred in Iowa in 2019. After a fire had started in a grain silo, ADM allowed fire crews to blast the product with water. Research going back decades showed the best way to handle a silo fire was to close all openings so it could burn out. Pressurized water only generates grain dust, creating fuel for the fire. ADM employees had no idea. As firefighters hosed the fire from the silo’s roof, it blew.
Two government investigations concluded ADM’s mismanagement was at least partly responsible for the death. ADM has denied this.
The same year, a section of ADM’s North American headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, exploded.
Again, mismanagement contributed, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found. ADM had not studied how destructive dust could be. Contractors had flagged incorrectly installed parts and parts needing replacement on the facility’s dust collectors, but no maintenance was performed.
Two more explosions rocked the facility in 2023. OSHA found the same problems: poor maintenance. Eleven workers suffered third-degree burns across their faces and bodies. ADM is contesting the government fines.
Between 2018 and 2024, ADM has had eight grain explosions, or about 13% of all such incidents in the agriculture industry, according to Purdue University research. Only two other companies have had more than one during that time period. Investigate Midwest also identified a handful of other grain fires at ADM facilities.
John Newquist, a former OSHA administrator who now trains companies on dust explosion prevention, said there’s little doubt ADM had policies in place addressing the problem.
“The real, million-dollar question is, Why didn’t they follow their own program? This is one of the 500 largest companies in the United States,” he said.
“They have everything to do it right. They have the money. They have the resources. There is no excuse for a big, billion-dollar company to have any dust explosions.”
Over the past six months, Investigate Midwest has repeatedly sought comment from ADM, first contacting spokeswoman Jackie Anderson in early November. She declined an interview request but asked for specific questions. Despite two rounds of detailed, written inquiries and repeated follow-ups since then, she has not responded.
In corporate documents, ADM has said safety is a top concern. Most years, about 80% of its locations, including about 200 North American processing facilities, have recorded no worker safety incidents, the company reported. After the 2023 explosions, ADM admitted in corporate records its “safety performance did not meet our expectations,” though it did not mention the incidents specifically.
“Our people are our lifeblood,” ADM has said. “We are refocusing our efforts in both occupational and process safety in support of our vision of Safe or We Don’t Do it. We remain committed to fostering a safe working environment for all of our employees and contractors.
ADM added it was “enhancing efforts” related to maintenance activities, risk management and employee health.
Preventing dust buildup can be challenging, said Kingsly Ambrose, a Purdue University professor and authority on grain dust explosions. Facilities process large volumes of grain, which is jostled around as it’s transported up and around the building. This flings grain dust into the air. “When it gets suspended in air, that’s the major challenge,” Ambrose said. In that scenario, even a small fire can lead to a massive conflagration.
“If anyone sees dust,” he said, “better to clean it up immediately.”
ADM has, at times, been slow to address maintenance issues. A stark example is the aftermath of the Christmas Eve explosion in Nebraska, which has not been previously reported. Newquist said the discussions detailed in the OSHA investigation are “rare” — company managers and executives are generally more tight-lipped.
After getting upset, the plant’s manager, Eric Stanley, took the safety inspector to his office. Stanley, who told the inspector he was “under intense pressure” from his bosses, unburdened himself. He had not stopped working in the week since the fire, he said, and he knew the facility was behind on dust maintenance.
Eventually, Stanley told the inspector he was “happy” OSHA was now investigating. When asked why, the inspector later wrote, “Stanley stated that (ADM) is finally doing things that needed to be done. (He) indicated that he has brought things to their attention in the past and no action was being taken.”
After OSHA’s visit, the plant was shut down for about a week. Soon after, ADM fired the facility’s maintenance contractor, A-Lert Construction Services, a Kansas-based company that installs and maintains dust collection systems. When the inspector interviewed an A-Lert manager, he seemed salty at the dismissal. ADM did not fix anything “until it was broken,” the manager said.
A-Lert did not respond to requests for comment. ADM did not comment on A-Lert’s responsibilities.
A-Lert’s performance later became a central issue at a meeting — it’s unclear where, based on reports — between OSHA and ADM. The inspector, Stanley and an ADM corporate lawyer were present.
Also attending was a longtime safety executive, David Frazelle. His tenure at ADM began in 1979. Over the years, he traveled the country to hand out safety awards, and he defended ADM against OSHA oversight. In one case, OSHA fined the company $7,000 for exposing workers to an unsafe manlift. Before an administrative law judge, Frazelle successfully argued the manlift was exempt from OSHA protections. At the time of the meeting, he was the executive in charge of safety for all of ADM’s milling operations, the places most at risk for dust explosions.
Frazelle said A-Lert employees lacked strong mechanical skills and were unqualified to work at the Fremont facility. Then, he acknowledged Stanley had told the truth: The plant manager had been raising the alarm for a while.
“I’m going to say something that our attorney isn’t going to like,” Frazzelle said, according to the inspector’s notes. “Eric has been trying to get rid of the maintenance company for quite some time.”
Frazzelle retired in February. Asked for comment, he replied to an Investigate Midwest email with a screenshot of ADM’s media relations webpage.
A century of dust explosions
Dust explosions have plagued the industry for at least a century, almost as long as ADM has existed. In 1919, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, starch factory blew, killing 43. Five years later, 42 died at a corn processor in Pekin, Illinois. In 1927, ADM formed its grain division.
Deadly incidents continued throughout the 20th century. In the late 1980s, a rash of explosions prompted OSHA to act. A new rule forced companies to practice preventative maintenance, write housekeeping policies and create escape plans. The agency also defined how much dust was considered safe, an 1/8 of an inch. “If you can write dust on the floor, that’s too much dust,” said Newquist, the former OSHA administrator.
Since the rule, the number of dust explosions, and the number of deaths, has decreased dramatically, according to OSHA. Still, dangers exist. In 2008, at the Imperial Sugar Company in Savannah, Georgia, managers had allowed “massive accumulations” of sugar dust to build up. The explosion killed 14 and injured dozens. OSHA fined the company more than $6 million.
Experts said, overall, facilities that generate dust have made strides in preventing incidents. In the past decade, the agriculture industry has averaged about eight explosions per year, according to Purdue University figures. It’s a good sign the average isn’t changing, Ambrose said. At times, though, he’s surprised at the lack of knowledge of some of the industry insiders he trains. “They never knew that dust could explode,” he said.
ADM has its own history of incidents. In 1998, five men were injured at its Decatur facility. They were investigating a smoldering fire inside a piece of equipment, and, when they opened it, the full blast hit them. Explosions also occurred in 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2011. Few injuries were reported, but one man died.
In 2013, ADM aimed to improve its overall safety management, which included a “focus on serious and potentially serious events,” according to corporate documents. In June 2016, it announced it had just had its safest year in company history. Adding to the good news, a press release proclaimed ADM had reduced all workplace incidents by two-thirds in the past decade.
In the press release, ADM’s president and CEO, Juan Luciano, said workplace safety had become a “cornerstone of our culture, but our work won’t be complete until we have eliminated 100 percent of the incidents and injuries companywide. We have an ongoing journey to zero.” It was important to take time, he continued, “to reflect on what we’ve done well and also what we can do better in the future.”
While ADM was trumpeting its safety culture, its negligence, OSHA found, was laying the groundwork for a devastating dust explosion.
Months after Luciano’s statement, a maintenance contractor inspected a chemical suppression system at the Decatur facility. The system was critical to preventing explosions. It was linked to an indoor bucket elevator, which shot grain upward and flung dust into the air. If the suppression system sensed an ignition, it would suffocate the fire, preventing destruction. The National Fire Protection Association, which sets industry standards, requires the system to be inspected every three months.
But no one else would inspect the system for years, with life-altering consequences.

ADM allowed first-responders to douse a smoldering silo. It was a fatal choice.
Two hours before sunrise on Saturday, Jan. 5, 2019, at ADM’s Clinton, Iowa, facility, a group of contractors arrived at a row of six concrete silos along the Mississippi River. Each silo was about 100 feet tall, 24 feet wide and more than a foot thick. Typically, about a thousand workers bustled around the facility, but on weekends, there was a skeleton crew, including contractors.
What they found that morning would prove deadly.
Inside one of the silos, wet, processed corn had crusted into a hardened bridge. The contractors had been blasting the blockage with water for months, trying to break it apart. The night before, they’d opened the silo’s hatches, allowing air to flow through. As they began again that morning, they noticed the corn material tumbling out — it was black, burnt.
The product had self-ignited. When stored, organic material can produce its own heat. Any exposure to oxygen can start a fire.
Silo fires have been a known risk for decades, and a growing body of research prior to 2019 showed what factors caused them and how to prevent smoldering burns from turning into destructive explosions. In 1988, Pennsylvania researchers published a study with a succinct conclusion: “Do nothing to increase the level of oxygen or air inside the silo,” the authors wrote. “Opening the top hatch cover to dump water or foam inside can create an explosive mixture.”
Simply, the best way to handle a silo fire is to close any openings and let it burn itself out. No one at the ADM facility that day knew that.
ADM did not answer questions about what its corporate safety team understand about silo fires or whether any plant personnel were trained on how to handle them safely. Small fires had occurred in the silos before, but ADM did not answer questions about what lessons were learned.
Alerted to the fire, ADM plant managers quickly gathered to determine how to proceed. They asked the contractors to douse the fire, but the contractors refused, citing lack of training. Around the same time, managers announced the emergency over the radio and called the Clinton Fire Department.
At 5:52 a.m., fire trucks arrived, and first-responders huddled with plant management about 500 feet north of the smoking silo.
ADM has hotly contested what happened next.
Two independent investigations, by a state office and a federal agency, concluded firefighters were given inaccurate information that determined their response. They were not told the silo contained potentially explosive corn material. Instead, they understood it housed a less flammable product. An explosion was also unlikely, they were told, because contractors had been soaking the material for months.
ADM has denied the findings. In a later court case, company lawyers deposed a firefighter who said ADM staff told him the silo could blow because of “corn dust.” The company claims the firefighter did not tell his supervisors.
ADM has not disputed what happened after, as detailed by the two government investigations.
As smoke filtered from the silo, the fire department and plant management continued to debate the best approach. Firefighters noticed a hatch about 13 feet off the ground, large enough for a person to squeeze through. Could they pump water through it? An ADM manager cautioned against it, arguing the burning product could spill onto those who opened the hatch.
Then, it was decided water would be pumped from the roof of the silo, through a top hatch. The fire department’s ladders could not reach the roof. Two men would have to summit the silo, shouldering 50 feet of hose, and connect the nozzles. Eric Hosette, 33, and Adam Cain, 23, prepared themselves.
An ADM employee guided the firefighters along a catwalk that led to the silo’s roof. With no respirator, the smoke overcame him. He was forced to turn back several feet from their destination. He pointed to the roof and rushed away. Hosette and Cain walked through a gray haze of smoke and dust to reach the opening. They began pumping.
On the ground, a new ADM manager arrived. He told the assembled crew the burning bridge was likely below the hatch, the one firefighters had originally wanted to open. Firefighters could likely extinguish the fire in relative safety. As the manager spoke, around 8:45 a.m., gray smoke turned white.
Then, a roar.
Hosette was hurled toward the ground and landed near the river. His colleagues rushed to revive him as a helicopter was called. At the hospital, he died from his injuries.
Attention then turned to Cain. ADM employees and firefighters searched the area but were unable to find him.
After about 30 minutes of searching, a contractor told firefighters the hatch had a viewport. No one had volunteered this information before. When firefighters peered through, they saw Cain sitting semiconscious on the bridge, among chunks of the roof.
Cain was hospitalized for three weeks. He declined an interview request, saying he wanted to move on. Hosette’s widow could not be reached.
The Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration completed its investigation in early 2019. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s worker safety arm, released its report in January. (The pandemic delayed its release, a spokesperson said.)
Iowa OSHA found ADM had failed to prepare its plant personnel to handle the emergency. Managers who assumed responsibility during the incident were “not properly trained.”

They did not effectively organize the company’s response, including assigning staffers to roles they were not qualified for, such as guiding firefighters to the silo’s roof. Because of poor training, “vital information” — such as the silo’s destructive contents or the presence of a viewport — was not communicated to first-responders.
ADM commissioned its own third-party investigation from Exponent, which specializes in workplace safety reviews. The report, obtained by Investigate Midwest, did not examine the company’s role in the explosion. Instead, it examined the explosion’s root cause: Water pumped through the silo’s top hatch. (Its author, Sean Dee, who spoke at two ADM-sponsored events before his investigation, did not respond to requests for comment.)
The report concluded the buildup of combustible gas in the silo was the explosion’s likely cause, but the presence of dust “could not be ruled out.” In this scenario, the water stirred up the grain dust. Side hatches left open overnight likely fanned the flames, but the water generated ample fuel.
In April 2019, Iowa safety inspectors explained their findings to plant management and lawyers. During the meeting, ADM “expressed concern regarding the penalty size,” inspectors noted. The company was fined about $56,000, less than many plant workers’ yearly wages.
As Iowa’s investigation concluded, ADM faced questions about its actions at another facility, about 200 miles south.
At ADM’s flagship plant, dangerous dust problems were ignored
Two days after the April meeting in Iowa, federal safety inspectors visited ADM in Decatur. The campus, on the Sangamon River’s banks, is almost two square miles and provides the city’s only skyline. A few thousand employees and contractors work there. The inspectors were investigating a series of failures that had led to a fireball blowing a hole in a grain elevator.
Missed opportunities to prevent the destruction stretched back to the previous summer. During an inspection, a technician noted that parts on a dust collector needed replacing. On another dust collector, parts were incorrectly installed.
Six months later, a technician inspected the same collectors, and discovered the same problems. Yet another dust collector was also likely malfunctioning, but, the technician told the feds, he was “allowed very little time to investigate” the problem.
Also, ADM had not analyzed the risk dust posed to its facility, which is considered an industry best practice. The company didn’t even have guidelines written down for how to analyze such a risk, inspectors found. Without a policy, ADM was missing a “critical step” in determining how to prevent dust explosions.
ADM’s response to the explosion was haphazard as well, safety inspectors discovered during their April visit. After the blast, the company installed two chemical suppression systems, which could snuff out flames. However, it was unclear if the systems were “operational and effective.” Nothing documented their proper installation.
Despite the litany of issues, accountability proved elusive. In a July 2019 letter, federal officials informed ADM that “no OSHA standards generally apply to the majority of the concerns.”
In cases where specific violations aren’t on the books but an unsafe environment exists, OSHA can wield what’s called the “general duty clause.” Essentially, it ensures employers provide an overall safe workplace. The standard is rarely invoked.
In this case, OSHA officials decided it was “not considered appropriate at this time” to use the general duty clause. There would be no citations, no fines.
“In the interest of workplace safety and health,” an official told ADM at the time, “I recommend that you voluntarily take the necessary steps to eliminate or materially reduce any employee exposure” to dust explosions.
ADM did not answer Investigate Midwest’s questions about what new safety measures it implemented following OSHA’s admonishment.
In 2022, ADM’s corporate leadership unveiled a new slogan for its facilities: “Safe or We Don’t Do it.” The company announced, “We have improved our investigation work processes with a goal to prevent repeat incidents.”
The new focus was almost immediately put to the test.
Back-to-back explosions rock the Decatur plant
Around 2:50 p.m. on April 20, 2023, Antonio McElrath clocked into work on the western half of the Decatur campus. His job was in an area where grain flew through conveyor belts and bucket elevators, stirring up dust. By the time he entered, dust littered the interior.
For ADM workers, nothing about the situation seemed amiss, according to a lawsuit McElrath later filed. The outgoing shift did not indicate anything was unusual. But unknown to McElrath, the dust had already reached dangerous levels.
Later in the workday, employees discovered a bucket elevator was smoking. It was outfitted with a chemical suppression system, which theoretically could suffocate any nascent fire. But the system had not been inspected since late 2016. If it had been, inspectors would have found it was inoperable.
As smoke filled the area, McElrath was directed where to stand by his immediate supervisor, according to his lawsuit. The bucket elevator was opened. An influx of oxygen hit the smoldering grain. He heard a deafening pop.
He suffered third-degree burns across his face, torso and legs. Doctors placed him in a coma for three weeks. “He has lifelong injuries,” his lawyer said. Two other men were hospitalized with severe burns. One suffered permanent damage to his arms, hands and fingers. Another’s entire body was torched. (The men could not be reached for comment through their workers compensation attorneys.)
While their coworkers recovered, plant employees had a short reprieve. Around 7 p.m. on Sept. 10, 2023, a building processing soybeans was torn open. The explosion was one of the worst in the agriculture industry in recent years.
Eight employees were injured. Helicopters rushed at least four to trauma centers. One man was transported 150 miles east to Indianapolis for specialized burn treatment, according to the Decatur Herald & Review. Another man’s lungs were burned. A single mother of two suffered burns on her back. (None of the workers could be reached for comment.)
A month later, OSHA fined ADM $325,000 for the April explosion. The company’s failure to inspect the chemical suppression system for several years was a major reason for the hefty fine. Also, OSHA mandated the company develop a “written housekeeping plan” — which it first suggested the company do after its 2019 explosion — to ensure dust does not reach dangerous levels.
ADM is contesting the fine, which is currently at about $200,000. While the fine amount is debated, OSHA’s investigation into the April 2023 explosion remains open. The agency fined ADM about $50,000 for the September 2023 explosion, and that investigation also remains open, as ADM contests the fine. (Detailed accounts about how the explosions started are not available until the investigations are administratively closed.)
David Horn, a Decatur city council member, said, if “systemic issues” plague ADM’s operations, the company must address them. But assessing the quality of ADM’s safety oversight will be challenging if the company is not sharing information publicly, Horn said.
The only communication between the company and the city about the explosions appears to be a single email exchange. Gregory Webb, an ADM lobbyist, forwarded the company’s public statement about the September explosion to Decatur Mayor Julie Moore-Wolf. She replied, in full, “Thank you!”
When asked about her communication with ADM, Moore-Wolf said, “My initial concerns were about the injured workers, and their progress toward recovery. I do not recall specific dates or details of communications regarding the accident.”
Without a full accounting of the changes ADM is pursuing, it can be difficult to trust the company’s actions, Horn said. “I think it would create greater confidence among our city residents to hear from ADM: This is what happened, these are the steps that we have taken since then and this is why these types of incidents won’t happen again.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Admfinal-2-1024x768.png,,,2025-05-24 10:01:58.272944

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.
The Tulsequah Glacier meanders down a broad valley in northwest British Columbia, 7 miles from the Alaska border. At the foot of the glacier sits a silty, gray lake, a reservoir of glacial runoff. The lake is vast, deeper than Seattle’s Space Needle is tall. But it didn’t exist a few decades ago, before 2 miles of ice had melted.
On an overcast day, a helicopter carrying three salmon scientists zoomed up the valley. As it neared the lake, the pilot banked to the right and flew over the south side of the basin, whirring over a narrow outlet where it drains into the Tulsequah River. He landed on a beach of small boulders and the researchers clambered out one by one.
“We don’t think there are fish here yet,” said one of them, Jon Moore, an aquatic ecologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. “But there will be soon.”
The lake, so new to the landscape that it doesn’t have an official name, is still too cold and murky for salmon. But that’s likely to change soon: As the Tulsequah Glacier above it retreats, the lake is getting warmer and clearer, becoming a more attractive environment for migrating fish. “It’s going to be popping off,” Moore said.
It’s among hundreds of ice-fed lakes, rivers, and streams in Alaska and western Canada that could turn into prime fish habitat as the planet gets hotter. These new salmon grounds could help counteract other threats to the fish from climate change, such as warming seas and drought. And they could bolster a commercial fishing industry that generates millions of dollars for the state each year.
The disappearance of glaciers is also creating opportunities for the multibillion-dollar mining industry. Like migrating salmon, mineral exploration companies are moving quickly into areas exposed by melting ice, hoping to strike the next big lode.
With gold prices booming and demand soaring for copper, a metal necessary for making solar panels and electric cars, mining corporations have backed a number of major projects in the region. The Canadian government is paying for roads and power lines to improve access to them.
This mineral rush promises jobs and revenue for some towns and First Nations in northern Canada. But it’s troubling to many Alaska fishermen, environmental advocates, and Indigenous leaders living downstream, near several salmon-rich rivers that start in Canada and head west across the international border. The Tulsequah River is a major tributary of the Taku River, which runs about 50 miles from British Columbia’s Coast Mountains to the Pacific Ocean just south of Juneau, Alaska. The Taku supports iconic runs of sockeye and coho salmon that power commercial fishing businesses in both countries. In 2023, Moore and other researchers warned in the journal Science that, barring key policy reforms, future mines could impair future salmon habitat in glacier-fed watersheds like the Tulsequah and Taku.
Alaska Native leaders have called on British Columbia’s provincial government to clamp down on mining in the region, and some First Nations are working to restrict mineral exploration and development in their traditional territories. But Canadian officials largely support the proposed mines, and the Trump administration has stayed quiet on the issue of mining near the border, though Canada’s mineral riches have reportedly attracted President Donald Trump’s interest.
On the Tulsequah River, the stakes are clear. A few miles downstream from the new lake, a ribbon of rust-colored water flows into the waterway: acid runoff from a former gold mine. Contaminants from the Tulsequah Chief mine have been flowing into the river ever since the operation shut down in the 1950s. Alaska’s elected officials, salmon advocates, and Indigenous nations have urged British Columbia’s government and mining companies to clean it up for decades without success.
The pollution is confined to just a short stretch of river — and fish, including some salmon, still swim in the waters below it. Still, environmental groups often cite the uncontained acid drainage as an example of what can go wrong with mining.

A small Vancouver-based company, Canagold, wants to reopen and expand a different gold mine on the other side of the river from the shuttered Tulsequah Chief. The opening of a new mine could coincide with the expansion of salmon grounds in the upper Tulsequah watershed. Moore and his colleagues hope that their projections of emerging fish habitat in the lake that drains into the Tulsequah River will be incorporated into environmental assessments for new mining proposals like Canagold’s.
In some watersheds, nearly all of the projected habitat lies within a few miles of mining claims. Even though no fish swim in those lakes and streams now, that could change in just 20 or 30 years, the lifespan of a typical mine, said Chris Sergeant, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Washington who works with Moore on the Tulsequah and nearby rivers. Sergeant wants regulators to consider this prospect before they approve a mine. Accounting for this future habitat is especially important, he added, “because there just aren’t that many places where salmon are doing well.”

News articles describing the effects of climate change on salmon usually tell an alarming story: Fast-warming oceans and rivers are threatening an iconic fish that thrives in cold water, while record droughts are drying up their streams.
Some of these grim effects were on display last September about 250 miles south of the Tulsequah Glacier at Meziadin Lake, a long basin ringed by hemlocks and firs, near the small mining town of Stewart, British Columbia. It’s one of the province’s most abundant spawning areas for sockeye salmon.In a typical year, hundreds of thousands of sockeye fill Meziadin Lake and the surrounding creeks. Two creeks that feed the lake, Hanna and Tintina, have a reputation for being especially prolific. Each September they swell bank to bank with sockeye, splashing, spawning, and dying en masse. These runs can be so plentiful that wolf packs and grizzly bears sometimes catch fish within feet of each other.
 
As salmon disappear, a battle over Alaska Native fishing rights heats up

	But last year, during what should have been the peak of Tintina’s sockeye run, only a handful of salmon made it upstream. After a summer of high temperatures and drought, the creek was flowing at its lowest level in recent history, said Kevin Koch, a fish and wildlife biologist who works for the Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs, a First Nation whose traditional territory encompasses the area. Below a highway bridge, the slow, sad creek looked more like a pond. A thick mat of algae blanketed its bottom.
Two years ago, “you would have seen hundreds of fish,” Koch said, looking down from the bridge on a crisp day last fall. He saw none.
Hanna Creek, a couple miles away, also trickled at a historic low, according to Koch — though some ruby-red fish still wriggled in its mucky water.
What’s happening at Hanna and Tintina is only part of the picture, though. As the planet warms, a third creek that flows into Meziadin Lake has also transformed in a stunning way, but one that’s actually helping salmon.
For a long time, Strohn Creek gushed out of a huge glacier, and hardly any sockeye swam in its turbid water. While glacial runoff helps make some streams more habitable for salmon by keeping them cool, it also can have the opposite effect: Streams that flow directly from glaciers are often near freezing, too cold even for the cold-loving fish. And they’re full of silt, which blocks the sunlight that forms the basis of the food chain. Salmon eat insects and tiny aquatic animals called zooplankton; the insects and zooplankton eat algae; and the algae feeds off the sun.

	As the glacier above Strohn shriveled up and retreated from a mountain pass in the second half of the 20th century, its runoff started to drain down the other side of the Coast Mountains, away from Strohn Creek. Without a torrent of ice melt, the creek lost its silt and warmed up enough that, after a few decades, salmon now spawn there in the thousands. “There was this huge shift happening before our eyes,” said Naxginkw Tara Marsden, who directs the Gitanyow Nation’s sustainability program.
Approaching Strohn Creek to observe the peak of last year’s sockeye run, Koch brushed aside alder branches and yelled to alert lurking brown bears.
“This spot is one of the most pain-in-the-ass spots for grizzlies, where I’m taking you,” Koch said. “So sorry about that.”
The stream came into view. Half-eaten fish carcasses were strewn along its banks, and dozens of bright-red salmon splashed in its shallow blue waters. Their tails slapped the surface as they fought against the current.

	In some years, more sockeye return to Strohn than to Hanna or Tintina Creek. Scientists think it could be a bellwether: There are countless creeks like Strohn across Alaska and western Canada — glacial streams that could transform into salmon havens as the ice above them melts. Fish are turning up in these new spots surprisingly quickly. Hundreds of miles from Strohn Creek, scientists found pink salmon in a stream in Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park less than a decade after it emerged in the wake of a receding glacier.
According to a paper in Nature that Moore co-authored in 2021, nearly 4,000 miles of new salmon streams could appear in Alaska and northwestern Canada by the end of the century. The gains could be “enormous,” Moore said.
And that estimate — one of the only published projections of emerging salmon habitat near glaciers — doesn’t account for new lakes, like the unnamed one below the Tulsequah Glacier, or streams or rivers that already support a handful of salmon but could boast a lot more. By one rough, unpublished estimate from Moore and his colleagues, the extent of lake habitat accessible to salmon in the 4.5-million-acre Taku River watershed could double over the next 100 years.
This all sounds promising for a species under siege, but salmon researchers warn that the region’s mining boom could stand in the way.
In the Nass River watershed, which encompasses Strohn Creek and Meziadin Lake, some 99 percent of emerging salmon habitat is within roughly 3 miles of mineral claims, according to Moore and Sergeant’s study.

Around the same time that Gitanyow leaders first witnessed the salmon bonanza in Strohn Creek, about eight years ago, they also discovered that companies looking for valuable minerals had staked mining claims in the mountains upstream, including beneath some of the small glaciers and snowfields that drain into the creek.
It was a glimpse of the mineral rush that now spans hundreds of miles of British Columbia’s Coast Mountains, from Meziadin Lake in the south to the Tulsequah Glacier in the north. Nicknamed the Golden Triangle for its metal-rich rocks, the region first lured prospectors 150 years ago. They led horses across glaciers, and tunneled thousands of feet into the ice using steam-powered equipment and sleds.

	Today, they travel by truck and haul drills by helicopter. Driven by record-high gold prices and demand for copper, northwest British Columbia drew some $250 million in investments in mineral exploration last year, accounting for more than 60 percent of the industry’s total expenditures across the province, according to British Columbia’s Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals. A government report in 2022 estimated that more than $900 billion worth of metals could be sitting beneath the Golden Triangle. That figure stands at well over $1 trillion with today’s record-high gold prices.
The mining industry’s mark on northwest British Columbia is hard to miss. Ore trucks thunder along the region’s main highway, hauling loads from a large copper mine, built a decade ago and now set to expand. A hefty 200-mile transmission line skirts the same road: a $500 million project developed in 2014 largely to power new mines with hydroelectricity. Large signs bearing the names of mining companies — Teck, Newmont, Skeena Resources — stand beside gated gravel roads that spur off the two-lane highway.
Deeper in the Coast Mountains, the gold and copper rush happens mostly out of sight, across roadless, heavily glaciated terrain. Roughly one-fifth of all the mining claims in northwest B.C. are covered by glaciers, according to a report released last year by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a global watchdog group. As those glaciers melt, they’re exposing outcrops of gold and copper that are luring mineral companies, whose geologists then drill into bedrock freshly exposed to the sun after thousands of years under ice. Mining companies are even staking claims beneath glaciers, poised to move in as soon as the ice melts.
“The glacier might melt at some point, and you want to be the first person” to see the rocks beneath it, said Matthew Reece, a U.S. Forest Service geologist based in Juneau who oversees mining in Alaska’s national forests.
Vancouver-based Scottie Resources Corp., one of the companies with claims in the mountains near Strohn Creek, has a few prospects that could attract more investors as nearby ice thaws. Hoping to find more gold, the company is drilling into the rock near a long-shuttered underground mine in a mountain partially covered by a glacier. Old tunnels, built decades ago, allowed miners to dig up just a sliver of the deposit. Scottie Resources is discovering more gold as the ice above it melts, according to Thomas Mumford, the company’s vice president of exploration.
“We are literally the first humans to look at those rocks,” Mumford told Grist.
Not far from Scottie’s claims, another small Canadian firm, Goliath Resources, recently discovered gold and copper in a small island of rock surrounded by a massive ice field. “I get the question, ‘Why hadn’t someone drilled it before?’” Roger Rosmus, Goliath’s chief executive, said in an interview posted on YouTube last year. “It was actually buried under the glacier and permanent snowpack, which are no longer there. We got lucky.”

	Reviewing filings from Canadian securities regulators, corporate presentations, and marketing materials for investors, Grist identified more than 20 companies that tout the promise of melting glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia. That number, likely an undercount, could grow as demand increases for metals like copper, and as more ice disappears. Last year, a private company named B-ALL Syndicate, partly funded by Goliath, launched a “large-scale exploration and prospecting program” aimed specifically at melting snow and ice across the region.
Most of these companies, including Goliath and Scottie, are small and based in Canada, where they can take advantage of generous tax policies. They tend to be funded by investors who like taking risks, or are eager for tax write-offs. Just a tiny fraction of prospects ever become producing mines.
Government support can help boost their chances, though — and the industry in northwest British Columbia has received a good deal of it over the past decade. Just last year, Canada’s federal government and British Columbia’s provincial government committed $140 million to upgrade the region’s only major road, Highway 37, explicitly to support production of “critical minerals.” Those are elements, like copper, that Canadian officials have deemed essential for national security and renewable energy.Some Alaskans, including the state’s Republican U.S. senators have worried that funding for Canadian mines could also come from the U.S. government, potentially boosting mining upstream from Alaska and endangering the state’s fishing industry. The Biden administration directed tens of millions of dollars to mineralprojects in Canada, also in the name of national security and clean energy as it considered Canada akin to a domestic source.

The Trump administration has yet to say if that funding will continue. Trump himself has signaled strong support for mining on the American side of the border: On his first day in office in January, he signed an executive order to develop Alaska’s minerals and other resources “to the fullest extent possible.
But Trump has also tried to unravel the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which established tax credits and other financial incentives that have spurred mining in both the U.S. and, indirectly, Canada. And some analysts have warned that certain tariffs Trump has threatened to put on Canadian goods could hamper Canada’s mining industry and the U.S. mineral supply chain.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, has called for a halt in sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to Canadian mines, citing past pollution, like the old, acid-leaking gold mine along the Tulsequah River. “I join many in Southeast Alaska who do not believe that our pristine waters are adequately protected,” she wrote to Biden in 2023.
Murkowski’s plea came even though she has supported mining elsewhere in the state. Earlier this year, she praised Trump’s Alaska-focused order.
Many Alaska Native leaders have also been lobbying against mining in Canada upstream from their communities. Worried about threats to salmon and other traditional food sources, the biggest Indigenous nation in Southeast Alaska — the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska — wants the B.C. government to put a hold on mine permitting in transboundary watersheds until Canada and the U.S. agree to a framework for resolving mining disputes in the region. The council has also asked for a permanent ban on storing waste behind large dams above salmon-bearing rivers that cross into Alaska.
Are critical minerals “more critical than our lives?” Richard Peterson, president of the Tlingit and Haida government, asked an audience of tribal citizens, environmental advocates, and government officials at a conference in Juneau last year. “More critical than the fish?”

	Government regulators and industry representatives contend that mining can be done safely, without harming salmon. All mining in British Columbia “is subject to a robust environmental review process, whereby any potential impact to wild salmon habitat must be avoided and mitigated,”according to a spokesperson for the province’s Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals. Regulators in the province ensure that any activity in mountain watersheds “adheres to the highest standards of environmental protection,” he wrote in an email.
The mining industry is also a vital source of jobs and revenue for two First Nations in the region: the Nisga’a and Tahltan. Over the past two decades, those nations have made deals with mining corporations for production royalties or cash payments, as well as commitments to hire their citizens. Tahltan leaders have also signed a series of agreements with the provincial government that gives the Tahltan a voice in regulatory decisions on a few mining projects in the nation’s traditional territory.

While small Canadian companies have been scouring rocks near receding glaciers, publicly traded mining giants have also been investing in prospects across Alaska and B.C. One of North America’s biggest, Newmont Corp., bought a company with two operating mines in northwest B.C. in 2023, and it’s now seeking to develop a third, in partnership with another mining giant, Vancouver-based Teck Resources.
That development, Galore Creek, would be a massive open-pit copper and gold mine 25 miles from the Alaska border, in an area ringed by receding glaciers. In 2023, Teck and Newmont’s geologists discovered minerals in rocks there that had been covered by ice a few years before. Last year, Canada’s department of natural resources handed the companies $15 million to build a key access road to a proposed processing site.

	Galore Creek’s backers are marketing the mine as a climate solution: It’s sitting on an estimated 12 billion pounds of copper, enough to make it one of North America’s biggest sources of the mineral. Since copper is great at conducting electricity, it’s especially useful for building energy equipment like solar panels and transmission lines. S&P Global projected in 2022 that demand for the metal would double by 2035.
But Teck, Newmont, and other mining corporations that could benefit from copper subsidies aren’t just after copper. Most of them are also looking for gold, which is used mainly for jewelry and in financial markets and considered less important for developing renewable energy than copper and other minerals like lithium and cobalt. The Biden administration didn’t consider gold “critical” but Trump promoted it along with dozens of other minerals in an executive order he signed earlier this year to spur mining nationwide. In addition to the copper that Galore Creek’s owners like to advertise, their mine could yield some 9 million ounces of gold, worth roughly $29 billion at current prices.
Critics argue that huge corporations shouldn’t be getting clean energy subsidies to dig gold out of the ground. The mining industry’s marketing of critical minerals, while miners largely hunt for gold, is “one of the biggest greenwashing efforts on Earth,” said Mary Catharine Martin, a spokesperson for SalmonState, an Alaska-based mining watchdog group.
One company that’s focused primarily on gold is Canagold, with its proposal to resurrect a mine along the Tulsequah River, some 40 miles from Juneau and about 8 miles downstream from the future sockeye lake that Moore and Sergeant are studying. Canagold bought the site in the 1990s and still hasn’t started producing. Soaring gold prices, driven by Trump’s tariffs and global economic uncertainty, however, have injected new life into the project, known as New Polaris. Canagold has proposed shipping construction materials by barge up the Taku River from Alaska and building an airstrip where the company would load ore concentrate onto planes to fly out of the mountains.

	The success of New Polaris hinges in part on a unique agreement between Canagold and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation, whose traditional territory encompasses the site and the Tulsequah River. Their agreement, announced in 2023, gives the nation a say — by a vote of its citizens — in whether the mine gets built.

	The Taku River Tlingit nation is also a key partner on Moore and Sergeant’s salmon research: The nation’s fisheries coordinator, Mark Connor, co-authored the 2023 policy analysis in Science that first noted the prevalence of mining claims near future salmon habitat. (Marsden, with the Gitanyow nation, was also a co-author on that paper.)
To keep emerging fish habitat intact, Taku River Tlingit established their own protected area, prohibiting mining across 60 percent of the Taku River watershed. In the other 40 percent, the First Nation allows some development with its approval. New Polaris sits in that zone, and the nation’s leaders are confident that Taku River Tlingit citizens will have a say in whether a mine ultimately gets built.
“We already have verbal agreements with the company that they will not proceed with a mine should our citizens, or the majority of our citizens, not agree with that,” said Rodger Thorlakson, Taku River Tlingit First Nation’s lands and resources manager.
Canagold, however, doesn’t have similar agreements with Indigenous governments downstream in Alaska. Clarence Laiti, president of the Douglas Indian Association in Juneau, said he’s “very, very concerned” about mining in the Taku River watershed. For decades, Laiti caught salmon for a living at the mouth of the Taku, some 30 miles below New Polaris. “It’s everybody’s river,” he said.



On the beach along the upper stretch of the Tulsequah River, 8 miles upriver from New Polaris, the three salmon scientists — Sergeant, Moore, and Brittany Milner, one of Moore’s doctoral students — unraveled a 30-foot seine fishing net. To learn more about the habitat, they catch, record, and release fish in dozens of spots along the river. They had never seen salmon this far up the river, this close to the new lake. They still sample the spot, though, because they think fish could appear any year as the water warms.
Milner grabbed one end of the long net and stood on shore. Moore took the other end and waded into the water, slowly walking in a circle to corral any fish that might have been lurking. Once again, they caught nothing.
About a week later, the researchers flew back to check a dozen small, cylindrical minnow traps that they had set in the lake itself. To their astonishment, they found a Dolly Varden, a common species of char, the first fish they’d ever seen in the new lake.

	“It was kind of surreal,” said Milner, who had set the trap in a shallow area near the mouth of a stream that was slightly warmer than the rest of the lake. Dolly Varden, which can tolerate very cold water, often move into glacial lakes and streams before other species.
“I’m assuming the fish was just in the lake swimming around and was able to find this pocket of a little bit warmer water,” Milner said. “I was really stoked.”
The rest of the traps came up empty: still no salmon. But to Milner and the other scientists, that one Dolly Varden sure looked like a sign of more to come.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Ben Carver, a boat captain for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, assumed the worst.
When Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed — killing six construction workers and sending thousands of tons of concrete and steel hurtling into the Patapsco River — Carver feared that the foundation’s nearby oyster reef would be smothered beneath the sediment and debris.
“I thought all of our little buddies out there would be dead,” said Carver, the foundation’s Baltimore Harbor Environmental Education Program captain.

He had last visited the reef, located beside historic Fort Carroll, the night before the tragedy, when he dredged up some oysters from the river bottom for a regular check-up. It would be about six months before he could return to inspect the reef, upon which 6 million oysters have been planted since 2008.
What he found surprised him. Healthy oyster after healthy oyster.
“These are resilient little things,” Carver said.
This month, the Bay Foundation began oyster planting at the fort for the first time since the bridge fell. In two boat trips to the site, schoolchildren and other volunteers have tossed an estimated 128,187 oysters overboard, to start their new lives in the Patapsco. The goal is to plant half a million oysters there this summer.
Last year, with maritime traffic limited in the Patapsco River channel during the typical planting season. oysters grown in and around the Baltimore Harbor that would have gone to Fort Carroll were planted in the Magothy River instead.
It was a hard decision, said Kellie Fiala, Maryland oyster restoration coordinator for the Bay Foundation. Staffers toyed with keeping the oysters in their dockside cages, and waiting to plant them at the fort, a manmade island fortress that never saw battle, but has become a sanctuary for cormorants, gulls and other seabirds. But keeping the oysters out of the reef during peak feeding season could have caused some to perish, Fiala said.
“People were very understanding, but we’re very excited to get oysters back in Baltimore, in the Patapsco River, where people are growing them,” she said.
Aboard the Snow Goose, the Bay Foundation’s educational vessel, volunteers start by counting the number of oysters, which appear as small dots on the rough grey shells, on a selection of shells. From there, they estimate the total number of mollusks that will be planted.
Once they reach Fort Carroll the process is simple: Volunteers grab a bright blue basket filled with oysters, and dump them over the side of the boat and into the murky depths.

But getting each oyster ready for release day is a bit more complicated.
It begins at the Bay Foundation’s Oyster Restoration Center in Shady Side, where oyster larvae are placed in tanks with recycled oyster shells, their preferred substrate. The setup mimics a natural process, which has become more difficult for baby oysters as the Chesapeake Bay’s oyster reefs dwindle.
“Imagine being fertilized, being born, and then having two weeks to find your forever home,” Fiala said. “That’s what they have to do.”
Once the baby oysters adhere to a shell, they’re known as spat. Afterwards, the spat-on-shell bound for Fort Carroll are moved to submerged cages around the Baltimore Harbor, where they are minded by volunteer “oyster gardeners” for their first year of life.
The cages help shelter the vulnerable young oysters, and keep them from sinking into the mud, serving the function of oyster reefs, which once rose above the surface of the Chesapeake in some places, snarling passing ships.
Domino Sugars in downtown Baltimore is a longtime “gardener,” and contributed tens of thousands of oysters to a planting this week, the second since the Key Bridge fell. Others came from the Seagirt Marine Terminal in Dundalk and Vane Brothers in South Baltimore, which are newer participants.
Frits de Goede, operations manager for Ports America Chesapeake, which operates Seagirt, said the group wants to up its game next year, in hopes of inching closer to Domino’s oyster number. Ports America grew 5,580 oysters this year, compared to Domino’s 21,060.
“We’re trying to work up to that,” de Goede said.
Gardeners periodically pull up the cages attached to their docks, and clean off any algae or debris, to ensure that the oysters get plenty of water flow.

Oysters are filter feeders, which means that they pull nutrients from the water column in order to survive and grow.
Therein lies their value to the Chesapeake Bay, which is beset by excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, runoff from farm field fertilizer and sewage treatment plant discharges, among other sources. The excess nutrients spur the growth of algae, which essentially suck oxygen from the water as they die, creating hazardous anoxic conditions — “dead zones” — for crabs and fish.
But adding more oysters in the Chesapeake means more nutrients will be filtered out, strengthening ecosystems and further growing the natural oyster population.
Decimated by disease, harvesting and habitat loss, the bay’s oyster population has plummeted since the 1800s. While it once took Chesapeake oysters an estimated three days to a week to filter all the water in the bay, it now takes more than a year, Fiala said.
“We also couple that with the fact that there’s more people in the bay watershed than ever before having an impact. So, we need more oysters in the water than we have ever had,” Fiala said.
The strategy could be working. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources released a summary this week of its latest stock assessment for oysters in Maryland portions of the bay, which found that the population increased from 2.4 billion adult oysters in 2005 to 7.6 billion in 2024.
Back then, Maryland’s oyster population was just starting to recover from devastating bouts of disease, such as MSX and Dermo.
Mike Wilberg, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science who led the assessment, pointed to three reasons for the increasing trend in a news release from the department.

“The first one is that we have had some good spatsets,” he said. “The second one is that natural mortality rates, or particularly disease, hasn’t been as bad as it was in the 1980s and 1990s. And then the last one is that the department has maintained restrictions on harvesting that have allowed the oysters that are in some of these areas to continue to survive and reproduce.”
The stock assessment doesn’t include oyster sanctuaries like the ones at Fort Carroll, focusing instead on oyster bars that are open to harvesting. But large-scale restoration sites, planted by DNR and partner organizations, make up substantial portions of several harvest regions — and they’re likely strengthening the oyster harvest in their areas, Wilberg said in the news release.
“The three major restoration sanctuaries that are pretty much finished have all been really strong successes,” Wilberg said.
But the Bay Foundation believes there’s more to be done.
In a 2024 report entitled “Hope on the Half Shell,” the foundation pushed for Maryland and Virginia to establish sanctuaries in an additional 20 tributaries, ensure that 11 existing tributaries are maintained, and bolster the aquaculture industry, which grows oysters for consumption, by leasing more areas to proprietors.
There are two small sanctuaries on either side of Fort Carroll, Fiala said: a 2-acre plot and a 1-acre plot. In part to protect those two areas, the Bay Foundation is keeping a close eye on the effort to demolish the remainder of the Key Bridge and build its successor, said Gussie Maguire, Maryland staff scientist at the foundation.
“There are certain practices that can be put in place — and that we’re advocating for — to minimize the impacts of disturbing the sediment with the explosives and all that,” Maguire said. “Silt curtains on land, turbidity curtains in the water.”
In a September 2024 letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is in charge of permitting for the new bridge site, the Bay Foundation highlighted the importance of the reefs.

While testing found the reefs in “relatively good” shape after the collapse and the subsequent salvage effort, “more extensive disturbances” could “impact these nearby reefs in the absence of proper precautions,” wrote Allison Colden, the Bay Foundation’s Maryland executive director.
“Nearly every weekday during the spring and fall school season, students sample the reefs at Fort Carroll to learn about the importance of oysters for water quality, habitat, and biodiversity,” Colden wrote. “The protection of these areas from disturbance and damage associated with bridge reconstruction will be critical.”
The Bay Foundation is also pushing for the rebuilt bridge to include new features such as upgraded filtration for stormwater, reducing the amount of rainwater that washes off the bridge’s roadway and directly into the Patapsco, carrying pollutants with it.
That could include the addition of a piping system with filters included, but it could also include the installation of rain gardens, known as bioswales, on either end of the new bridge, like at the Aurora Bridge in Washington State, the Bay Foundation said. Or the new bridge could host floating wetlands that could filter pollutants, like the ones installed at Baltimore’s National Aquarium nearby.
The new bridge will be wider than its predecessor, potentially increasing the discharge of pollutants “including trash, oil and grease residues, salt and brine during winter weather, and tire dust and other sediments,” and increasing the necessity of adequate stormwater treatment, Colden said.
In the meantime, the return of oyster plantings mere feet from the Key Bridge wreckage is a welcome symbol of the city’s toughness, Fiala said.
“Baltimore has a lot more behind it — a lot more resilience — than I think people give it credit for,” Fiala said.

Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) was the keynote speaker Friday at Bowie State University's spring commencement ceremony. (Photo courtesy of Bowie State University)Kermit the Frog got most of the attention — and delivered most of the bad puns — for a University of Maryland, College Park, commencement address Thursday, but there were plenty of others who suited up in a cap and gown for the chance to inspire, comfort and, most of all, congratulate Maryland graduates in the Class of 2025.
Their speeches ranged from under 13 to 24 minutes, tolerable for anxious graduates and fidgety relatives, and while many touched on the current troubles in the world, most urged graduates to embrace the challenge.
For most of her short six months on Capitol Hill, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has done battle with the agenda of President Donald Trump (R) and administration, which have been working diligently to dismantle the federal government. But in her commencement address Friday at Bowie State University, the former Prince George’s County executive’s 15-minute speech leaned heavily into one word: hope.
“It seems like all the good things are happening for the absolute worst people. It looks as if the cruelest and most selfish characters are getting the service ahead,” she said at the campus’ Bulldog Stadium. “My response to that is just live a little longer.
“The callous and self-centered personalities may seem popular, but trust me, the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” Alsobrooks said.
Part of her speech mentioned the late Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the South Africa’s apartheid system. After Mandela’s release from prison in February 1990, he was inaugurated as the country’s first Black president in May 1994.
Before Alsobrooks left campus, she spoke to a few reporters and was asked whether one of the “characters” in her speech happened to be Trump, especially for any graduates who may want to become public servants in the federal government. She answered by looking beyond Trump.
“The great thing for these young people is they have … their whole life ahead of them,” she said. “There will come a moment when this current administration will leave office and the rest of us are still going to be here to carry on, to rebuild whatever’s been broken and to continue to ensure that they have the economic opportunities and that their families have the true opportunity to experience the American dream.”
At University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — another of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, along with Bowie State — Gov. Wes Moore (D) urged graduates to imagine themselves looking back on the journeys they are just now starting.

Moore told the UMES graduates they would be asked repeatedly, on commencement day and after, what they plan to do with their new college degrees. But he asked them to think farther ahead and start planning for the question they will be asked at the other end of the road they are starting down: What did you do?
“The ones who obsess over answering ‘what will you do?’ are often the ones who lose sight of answering ‘what did you do?'” Moore said. “The ones who stay focused on answering ‘what did you do’ are the ones who will never waver in their convictions, and will always continue the work.”
In between citing the achievements of his administration and giving shout-outs to high-achieving graduates, Moore assured the graduates that it was OK if they didn’t have a ready answer to the many “what are you going to do” questions they are sure to get in the coming days. The important thing is to stay focused on making the difference once they find their goals.
“Because when you look back many years from now, you aren’t going to say to yourself: ‘I wish I were more certain about what I wanted to do right out of school,'” Moore said. “You’re going to say: ‘I’m proud of what I accomplished.'”
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) delivered the commencement address May 10 at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.
Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, who spoke for about 24 minutes, told the graduates they will face challenges in today’s political atmosphere.
“Your class is graduating in a moment of profound crisis for humanity, and searing existential choice for each and every citizen,” he said. “The river could be taken all of us to a place of danger, or to a place of renewal. I wish this was commencement speech hyperbole, but it’s not.”
Raskin said hope can be obtained, but everyone must participate to improve society.
“If we’re engaged in a sustained titanic and perhaps final struggle on this small planet between the forces of democratic freedom and the forces of fascist authoritarianism, this is a battle unlike we have ever seen before, and it requires all hands on deck,” he said.
“Remember always the beauty and promise of America, which is made exceptional not because it is magically immune to the forces of racism or antisemitism or fascism, but because the people have always insisted that we will move forward to form a more perfect union,” Raskin said.
The day before her husband spoke at UMES, Maryland first lady Dawn Flythe Moore on Wednesday gave a less than 13-minute address at the University of Baltimore commencement ceremony.
Moore, who worked as a substitute teacher in Baltimore after she graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park, summarized three lessons to solve “big” problems.
“Division is the greatest barrier to progress. Two, collaboration is our path to success,” she said. “And three, the only way to elevate the work is to strengthen community. That work is more important now than ever before. Community is our lifeblood. It is the only hope we have as a state to secure our future.”
Other commencement speakers who attempted to inspire at Maryland colleges and universities this month included: Vice President J.D. Vance addressing the 2025 Class of midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy; entrepreneur Sal Khan at Johns Hopkins University; TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett at Morgan State University; Global Refuge CEO Krish O’Mara Vignarajah at Goucher College; urban Afrofuturist Lawrence T.

President Donald Trump signed an order making  federal funding available to affected individuals in Caldwell, Laurel, Pulaski, Russell, Trigg and Union counties. Additional counties may become eligible for aid if warranted by damage assessments, FEMA said in a news release.
Nineteen people died in Kentucky as a result of tornadoes, storms and straight-line winds May 16-17.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who had asked Trump for an expedited disaster declaration, thanked the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a post on social media. 
“Remember, this process takes time and we will add more counties to our request as damage assessments are completed,” Beshear said.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster, the FEMA release said.
Jeremy Slinker has been named the federal coordinating officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Slinker formerly was director of Kentucky Emergency Management.
Individuals and business owners who sustained losses in the designated areas should first file claims with their insurance providers and then apply for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 1-800-621-3362 or by using the FEMA App. If you use a relay service, such as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, provide FEMA the number for that service.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2215237419-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-24 08:02:38.033591

(Photo by Janecze Wright/U.S. Army)This month, students across Maryland headed to school to celebrate National Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day. Many did so despite facing perilous routes, a stunning lack of basic infrastructure like crosswalks, and poorly designed streets resulting from decades of failed public policy that prioritized cars over pedestrians.
Far too often, tragedy is no accident. It’s inevitable.
In November 2023, that reality hit Prince George’s County when two elementary school students were struck and killed walking to school. Sadly, their deaths were no anomaly, with U.S. pedestrian deaths hitting a 40-year high – more than 7,500 – in 2022. That’s 20 pedestrian deaths every single day, and meaningful action is long overdue.
Prince George’s County is leading the way. After tragedy, parent leaders from 11 schools representing 8,200 students came together with a clear message: Every child has the right to get to and from school safely. In addition to the immediate hiring of additional crossing guards, they also called for long-term reforms and a renewed policy focus on pedestrian safety.
That effort and earned media campaign helped launch the Prince George’s County School Pedestrian Safety Workgroup, a collaboration of parents, municipal leaders, and school and county officials who spent six months crafting a detailed report of 18 Safe Routes recommendations released last December.
Some formalized existing policies, such as ensuring pedestrian safety infrastructure at the time of new school construction and proactive meetings between agencies to improve coordination and efficiency. The group encouraged partnerships between school, municipal and county officials. And recommended establishment of Safe Passage Coordinators, officially hired by Prince George’s County Public Schools this spring.

Many recommendations formed a roadmap for local education agencies and municipalities nationwide. Creating a unified walk audit template to help standardize data collection will help school administrators establish internal goals and timelines for implementing these walk audits, while collaborating with local officials to initiate an overall evaluation of accessibility around schools. Once concerns are identified, schools and municipalities are encouraged to establish long-term strategic plans to equitably improve pedestrian infrastructure.
This data and planning can help create a pedestrian safety risk measure for each school, ensuring resource allocations are prioritized by need instead of politics. And Board of Education members are encouraged to take on greater roles engaging and educating their own school communities on pedestrian safety.
One recommendation focused on bilingual outreach and pedestrian safety education to ensure “every child has the right to get to and from school safely” truly means every child. Another empowers students to become Vision Zero advocates by launching an annual Youth Transportation Safety Summit. This event, organized by the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, successfully hosted more than 100 attendees earlier this month. And the group recommended working with artists to create walkability safety signs and high-visibility artwork for crosswalks.
Schools are encouraged to participate in events like National Walk, Bike and Roll to School Days and Ruby Bridges Walk to School Day (Nov. 14) to increase parent and community engagement. County and school district officials are recommended to establish both as official events, and there’s an ongoing legislative effort to recognize Ruby Bridges Walk to School Day statewide.
Parents can organize “walking school buses” and walking groups to help reduce the number of families driving to school. Less cars around schools means less opportunities for tragedy.
One recommendation encourages increased traffic calming infrastructure around schools and temporary street closures at drop-off and pick-up. And it’s crucial to encourage principals to be proactive and empower them to create their own innovative solutions to improve school pedestrian safety.
Finally, some recommendations focused on legislative and government solutions. The group strongly encouraged using unspent funds to subcontract with municipal police departments for difficult-to-fill crossing guard positions.
One of the most important recommendations involved lowering speed limits around schools. Municipalities must have greater autonomy to keep their own residents safe, without regulatory hurdles. The National Transportation Safety Board found a pedestrian struck at 20 mph has a 90+% survival rate; at 30 mph, chances of survival are around 55%. Lowering speed limits, while protecting and enhancing the radius of school zones, will save lives.
Creating safe walkable routes to schools is a rare opportunity for bipartisan consensus at every level of government. Investing in safer streets around schools also helps create safer routes to small businesses, parks, libraries and other community hubs. But we can’t expect students and families to walk to school – or anywhere in our communities – if we don’t provide them with the safe routes to do so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8591599.jpg,,,2025-05-24 08:02:38.033591

Bob Ferguson signed the next state budget on Tuesday, he vetoed a few dozen spending provisions scattered throughout its 1,366 pages.
The plan he approved lays out $78 billion in spending over two years. The roughly 55 items he removed add up to around $22.3 million in savings. 
He zeroed out funding of contracts to nonprofits serving foster youth, college students, immigrants, and seniors. He canceled spending for studies and work groups. Ferguson’s veto message, containing an itemized list, spans 15 pages.
Here are some of the targets of Ferguson’s veto pen.
Issaquah Teen Center
The Garage is a cafe where high school students can drop in after school and receive tutoring, counseling, or case management services. 
It will lose $300,000, or roughly one-fifth of its budget. If the dollars cannot be made up through private donations, the center will look at reducing its services for teens. The reduction would have a “massive impact” in the community, said KayLee Jaech, the group’s executive director. 
The governor wrote in his veto message that supporting programs and services for youth is important, but cited budget constraints. 
Mentor Washington
Mentor Washington has been recruiting, training and providing support for mentoring programs for at-risk youth in Washington using $1.55 million in contracts with the Department of Children, Youth and Families. About half is getting spent now on a pilot effort focused on foster youth.
Lawmakers shaved $1 million of that sum in the budget they sent Ferguson. While he noted the significant reduction for the “valuable” program, he axed the remaining $550,000. 
“We need to find a way to regroup and reconfigure what service looks like moving forward,”  said Jolynn Kenney, executive director of Mentor Washington.
Redmond Latino Cultural Center
Centro Cultural Mexicano in Redmond provides services for low-income, immigrant, and Spanish-speaking residents in King and Snohomish counties. 
They will lose a $200,000 state grant, which helped connect clients with health care, financial coaching, small business assistance, internships, and home buying services — all at no cost.
Free services like this help support communities, Ferguson said. But he said that due to the budget challenges, this program was something the state couldn’t afford.
Refugee Women’s Alliance 
Refugee Women’s Alliance provides services to refugees and immigrants, including an ice skating lesson program for preschoolers from diverse and low-income families.
They will lose the $200,000 the Legislature allocated for the skating program. They have previously received money from the state and have also partnered with the Seattle Kraken and One Roof Foundation. 
Political conservatives were sharply critical of this grant-funded program on social media. The governor said that while youth enrichment opportunities like this are beneficial, this one needed to be cut because of the budget deficit. 
Hospitality Center of Excellence
A year ago, the state Board for Community and Technical Colleges received $257,000 “solely for the creation of a Hospitality Center of Excellence” at Columbia Basin College in Pasco. 
It launched in January with its leadership drawing up a game plan to strengthen ties between culinary programs on campuses with hospitality businesses and organizations. A key goal was to develop best practices and strategies for workforce education and training in the industry.
Not now. It will close up shop in July. Though the Legislature did budget $408,000 for two years of operation, Ferguson deemed the “worthwhile endeavor” not affordable and crossed it out.
Offshore wind projects
The state Department of Ecology won’t get $816,000 of Climate Commitment Act proceeds to assess Washington’s siting and permitting authority around potential wind energy projects in federal waters off the state’s coast. The agency was also going to look into the ecological impacts of such undertakings as part of a broad analysis.
“Given the current federal administration’s position on offshore wind, this work is less
time sensitive,” Ferguson wrote in his veto message, adding he is “committed to continued dialogue with coastal Tribes regarding the future of offshore wind projects.”
Meanwhile, Ecology did receive $338,000 to develop “planning, engagement, and evaluation tools for effective ocean management and offshore wind energy development.” And Ferguson left $500,000 in the budget to contract with “a nonregulatory coalition” in Seattle that wants Washington to be able to receive power from future floating wind projects off the West Coast.
Senior housing options
How many places in Washington market themselves as “senior independent living” communities for individuals aged 55 years and older? 
Lawmakers put $80,000 in the budget for the state Department of Commerce to come up with an answer. And, by July 1, 2026, the department was to make recommendations on creating a registry of senior living locations as a consumer protection move for residents and prospective residents. Not going to happen.
“Supporting our seniors is important to me but I am vetoing this item because of the state’s significant fiscal challenges and funding cuts from the federal government,” Ferguson wrote to lawmakers in his veto message.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2829-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-24 07:01:44.096996

(Courtesy of Grace Rochelle)The 2024 presidential election had not happened when Grace Rochelle wrote an essay for her AP comparative government class at Rogers High School in Newport responding to the question of “Is America Today Our Forefathers’ Vision?”
But her perspective on the growing divide between conservatives and liberals remains relevant four months into the second administration of President Donald Trump. Rochelle sees the lack of political and social connection and collaboration at the national, state and local levels as hindering the country’s progress.


Grace Rochelle will read her award-winning VFW Voice of Democracy essay as the featured speaker at the 51st annual Memorial Day Commemoration on Monday, May 16, at 1 p.m. at the Rhode Island Veterans Cemetery in Exeter.
Listen to the audio version of essay here.

“I thought about the issues in America, and I don’t really feel like we’re in a place where we can be proud, I guess you could say, of where we’re at because a lot of issues need to be resolved,” Rochelle said.
History teacher Coleen Turner made the essay a mandatory assignment for her students and gave them the option of recording the essay and submitting it to the 2024-2025 Veterans of Foreign War Voice of Democracy National Scholarship Competition through VFW Post 406 in Newport. Rochelle, a competitive tennis player with three State and All-Division honors to her name, including 1st team All-State this year, was fair game.
“I thought I already did the essay, I might as well do the recording,” Rochelle, 17, a Rogers senior, recalled.
“It took a few tries, or more like 20, 25 tries,” she said. “It was either too short or too long depending on how I was pacing myself. But I just thought you know why not? We’ll see what happens.”
What happened was the VFW Department of Rhode Island named Rochelle the state winner. She won a total of $2,000 in scholarships and received a trip to the 2025 VFW Washington Conference held March 2-6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

“It was the best trip I’ve ever been on. It was cool to be around a bunch of different kids,” Rochelle said, adding she made several new friends.
“I got (to be) pretty good friends with Oklahoma and Guam and Louisiana and New Jersey. Those were the four girls I really clicked with.”
Rochelle will read her award-winning essay as the featured speaker at the 51st annual Memorial Day commemoration on Monday at 1 p.m. at the Rhode Island Veterans Cemetery in Exeter to honor service members who sacrificed their lives for our nation.
Gov. Dan McKee, the state’s four congressional delegates and state office holders and lawmakers are scheduled to attend. The 88th Army Band of the Rhode Island National Guard will perform and Gold Star Family members will participate in the ceremony.
Rochelle is the daughter of Brian and Carrie Rochelle, both Army veterans who served tours in Iraq. Her parents work at Naval Undersea Warfare Center where her mother is a contracting officer and her father is a contracts manager.
She plans to attend the University of Notre Dame to study political science and economics, with hopes of going to law school and making a career in international politics and government. Her dream job is to become a diplomat for the U.S. State Department or the United Nations.










I thought about the issues in America, and I don’t really feel like we're in a place where we can be proud, I guess you could say, of where we’re at because a lot of issues need to be resolved.


– Grace Rochelle, 17, of Newport


In discussing this year’s VFW Voice of Democracy question with her comparative government students, Turner had them the ideas of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness emerging from the Declaration of Independence and the contradictions over the meaning of equality as applied to different demographic groups.
“It was a good question. It fit in well with my curriculum,” Turner said of the class which looks at six different countries in relation to life in the United States.
Rochelle’s award-winning essay takes a contrarian view. She argues that the U.S. has been weakened by divisiveness and that’s not what the founding fathers envisioned at all.
“You go back to George Washington’s farewell address and he warned about political factions and that’s where we are as a society. We have political factions,” Rochelle said.
“I don’t necessarily feel like they are a horrible thing, but what political parties do however, is make people close-minded from what I’ve seen a lot of times. People aren’t willing to hear the other side and even consider the other side, and I think that‘s where the real issue comes.”
The solution, she said, is to somehow bring people back to the moderate side of both parties. 
“I do think the majority of Americans are somewhat moderate. They’re the less outspoken ones and I think we need to be uplifting the voices of those who are moderates and giving them the bigger platform than people who are far left and far right.”
Turner said Rochelle presented a “unique voice and a different perspective.”
“It came out really well,” Turner said of Rochelle’s essay. “She’s made us all proud. She’s going to do great things.”



Is America today our forefathers’ vision? 
By Grace Rochelle
When answering whether America today is our forefathers’ vision, there may be a variety of responses. On one hand, Americans are still some of the most passionate people when it comes to upholding liberties, democracy, and nationalism. But on the other hand, we have never been more fractionalized, and the divide between conservatives and liberals seems to continue to grow. I will attempt to navigate these complexities and demonstrate that overall, America today is not our forefathers’ vision.
The struggle to answer this question is mainly the stark differences between the late 18th century and the 21st century. Our forefathers could not possibly imagine the advancements we have today, especially when it comes to technology, transportation, and media. For example, Thomas Jefferson, a major proponent for privacy and freedom, may find mass surveillance and data gathering disturbing and unconstitutional. Furthermore, the further in time we progress, the more different our country will look compared to when it was founded. So how can we compare values from the late 1700s to today’s? I believe that as time progresses, central values may also have to progress and/or change to better fit the people of the time. 
Next, we look into what the forefathers wanted for our country. The most important and main issue was independence. In Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary, independence meant, “A state of being not dependent; complete exemption from control, or the power of others; as the independence of the Supreme Being.” I argue that today, we are greatly economically dependent on other countries through the trade of goods and services which goes against our Founding Fathers’ vision. Dependency, such as our large debt to China and reliance on their goods, leads us to be vulnerable to instability if a country were to collapse or eliminate trade with us. Since World War I, the U.S. has taken a sort of overseer role in the world. As a global power, we always appear to aid countries in need, whether it be supplies or money. While this certainly is a morally good thing, it also can undermine what gets done internally.   
In addition to the question of our true independence as a state, many of the forefathers were very weary and against the forming of political factions, but today we have not been more divided as a country since the Civil War because of factions. The current split between the conservatives and liberals has seriously hindered the progress of the legislature in this country, divided not just the government but also citizens, and weakens the country’s internal strength. The Founding Fathers knew the importance of unity, as they brought the 13 colonies together not just for the Revolutionary War against the British, but also to form a new country. They promoted and inspired nationalism in the colonies and preached that unity was vital to protecting America from external influences. With the constant stalemate we see in Congress, we have seriously fallen behind in making a budget for our country and addressing social and other important political issues. I believe the current disunity in this country is the complete opposite of what the forefathers hoped to continue for America. The internal conflict disrupts the nation’s progress and displays our weaknesses to our largest enemies such as China, Russia, and Iran. 
Although America today has seemed to have fallen on a different path from what our forefathers were envisioning, we have always and will continue to have fighting spirits. When it comes to civil liberties and social issues, Americans are some of the most vocal out of any groups in the world. While this is one of the main causes for discontinuity, it does show the freedom and pride that people have to improve this country. In the beginning days of our country, the Forefathers wanted the people’s voices to be heard, setting up a system to ensure that was made possible. Today we see that same system allowing citizens to protest issues such as abortion and gun laws, without prosecution. That system in the 18th century instilled a sense of identity and nationalism into the new American people and continues to do that in Americans today. 
Overall, America today is not our forefathers’ vision, whether it be the issue of independence or political factions. And while we have fulfilled some of their manifestations, altogether the drastic difference in society now has prevented their vision from completely continuing. While I wouldn’t expect America to be fully on the path of our forefather’s vision, I do believe they would feel we seriously need to fix our current system, economically, socially, and politically.

Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances, and deal with none of its consequences.
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control until the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution.
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. (Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

Story summary

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on in February urging Consumers Energy to delay the closure of the J.H. Campbell plant, however, it stopped short of filing a lawsuit in April.
Consumers Energy previously said the plan for closure was vetted and approved from multiple stakeholders and regulatory agencies; it is unknown how much coal remains at the site to continue operations.


PORT SHELDON TWP. — The long-planned closing of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township will be delayed at least 90 days after Trump Administration officials issued an emergency order directing Consumers Energy to remain “available for operation” going into peak summer demand.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, in coordination with Consumers Energy to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant to “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.
The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”
On May 14, Consumers officials said the planned May 31 closure of the Campbell plant remained on track. After Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, however, the company said it would comply.
“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said in a Friday statement to ONN.
 A long-debated topic

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.
The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.
In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from MISO as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.
MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”
“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.
NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”
“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.
Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.
“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”
One component of the cost savings was coal.
Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.
“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train car loads a day.”
Consumers did not respond to an inquiry Friday evening on how much coal remained on the site.
 A political talking point

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema — who strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure — asked the utility company’s officials in February what new assets were being brought onto the grid.
Isabell pointed to renewables as well as natural gas assets.
“We do have a lot of renewables that are coming online, so that is very important to us,” she said. “We do have natural gas. We like natural gas. It is part of our future that we have — it is agile, it’s able to come online quickly, we can dispatch that in a matter of hours, versus a matter of days in the cold — so we see natural gas as part of our future.”
Isabell also noted wind and solar and battery storage, “which is going to be a major, major component and required by law, so we are going to be adding a ton of battery storage as well.”
After Isabell noted that the state’s new clean energy laws required energy companies to have clean and sustainable energy sources by 2040, OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea asked if the new Trump Administration’s policies could lead to a relaxation in Consumers’ plans.
“Is it possible we might see a change in that legislation that would lift those requirements? I’m just wondering if it could be slowed down if we’re not looking at deadlines until 2040,” Rhodea said.
Isabell said Consumers was committed to its clean energy plan in 2021 — before the legislation in Michigan was approved in 2023 — and that bringing massive assets like the Campbell on and off the grid is no simple or quick task.
“We do our best to try to be as agile as possible, but assets like this aren’t something that you can just bring on and take off very quickly,” she said. “So we do our best in these integrated resources plans to try to plan for what we think could be possible in the future. But we can’t plan for everything that could happen with any type of policy. So our plan to retire (Campbell) was on the last integrated resource plan, which does actually meet the new state policy, which works for us going forward.
“But large assets like that aren’t something that you can just quickly change with new policies in two years.”
The integrated resource plans are required by the Michigan Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees public utilities in Michigan.
“The Michigan Public Service Commission requires us to create a 20-year plan that says, ‘How are you going to serve your customer, clean, reliable and affordable energy for the next 20 years?’ And this requires us to come up with scenarios,” Isabell said.
Those scenarios are then presented to stakeholders in a series of workshops over two years with community stakeholders who then provide feedback to help.
“We’re retooling, and we’re getting ready to do our next integrated resource plan, new technologies, new laws, new things like that require us to be agile. We constantly need to update those plans and make sure that we’re giving our customers the best technology and the best cost we possibly can,” Isabell said.
 How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.
“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”
The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.
At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.
“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net zero carbon emissions.”
Key to that strategy are natural gas-fired plants in Consumers’ portfolio, Van Kley said, which include locations in Zeeland, Jackson and a 1,200-megawatt facility that began operating in Van Buren County’s Covert Township in June 2023.
Those operations “will supply reliable, on-demand electricity to meet Michigan’s energy needs when renewables and other sources are not available,” Van Kley said.
Meanwhile, efforts continue to restart operations at Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert Township. The facility, owned by New Jersey-based Holtec International, went offline for decommissioning in May 2022.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-05-24 07:01:44.096996

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Income levels v. affordable housing markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”

Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 More schools, hospitals providing housing help for teachers, nurses

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast home-building states, like Idaho, have higher birth rates, federal data show

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Mesonet system)LINCOLN — Two National Weather Service offices that cover some rural parts of Nebraska will no longer monitor local weather around-the-clock. 
The Weather Service offices in neighboring states that forecast parts of western and southwest Nebraska cut back from 24/7 coverage after staffing reductions were made under the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. One office in Wyoming covers eight counties in the Nebraska Panhandle, and the other, in Kansas, forecasts for three counties in the southwestern corner of Nebraska. 
Those two offices in neighboring states are among only four nationally so short of staff that they lack enough meteorologists to staff an overnight shift. Other nearby forecasting offices — dealing with their own staffing problems — will have to handle the load during those shifts. They will be tasked with monitoring conditions and temporarily issuing forecasts and warnings each night for the two regions in addition to their normal coverage duties. 

Earlier this month, five former National Weather Service directors wrote an open letter to the public expressing fears that the cuts would endanger lives. An agreement last month between the Weather Service and its employees’ union warned of “degraded” services as more people leave.
“These shortages threaten public safety,” said Nebraska State Climatologist Deb Bathke, who works out of the State Climate Office based at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Bathke said staff may be unable to provide accurate and timely severe weather warnings, monitor for storm reports and monitor radar during severe weather because the offices are running thin. 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson Kim Doster told the Nebraska Examiner that the Weather Service has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts from shifting personnel. The same NOAA spokesperson told the New York Times that “several local NWS offices are temporarily operating below around-the-clock staffing.”
“These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce,” Doster told the Examiner. 
The Trump Administration fired roughly 600 workers at NOAA and NWS in March as it tried to reshape the federal bureaucracy. NWS was understaffed long before Trump’s second term, but the recent cuts required “urgent action,” according to NOAA. 
NOAA is offering paid moving expenses to get employees to move voluntarily to fill positions across the country, including the Kansas office that covers Nebraska. Like other rural areas across the U.S, rural Nebraska has fewer news outlets providing crucial, time-dependent information, such as weather alerts, to the public. Many of those areas rely on rural radio stations. 
Nebraska Rural Radio Association, also known as Rural Radio Network, is a group of stations owned by farmers and ranchers that provides news and weather reports for rural areas of the state. NRRA’s Bill Boyer, who manages the Scottsbluff market, said the change “raises concern” due to the possibility of a missing severe weather alert. 
Boyer said that western Nebraska had its own NWS office in the 1990s, but it was shut down, and the remaining operations were moved to the Cheyenne office in Wyoming. 
“More troubling is that we received no communication from the National Weather Service,” Boyer said. 
Kevin Spencer, manager of the biggest city in the Panhandle, Scottsbluff, told the Examiner that the city is monitoring the changes to the Cheyenne NWS office and working with the Scotts Bluff County Emergency Management Office to do so.
“We support NWS staff and have complete confidence in their ability to manage their time effectively, ensuring we receive accurate information in the event of inclement weather,” Spencer said. “We have been assured that staff will be available in case of severe weather.”
The two parts of Nebraska affected by the recent staffing cuts in forecasting are in U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith’s congressional district and include his Gering-area home. 
Smith said timely and reliable weather warnings can make all the difference in a region of the state where severe weather can arise suddenly. 
“I am working to get additional information from the NWS to ensure Nebraskans have access to the information they need when it counts,” Smith said. 
Russ Pankonin, who lives in the state’s southwestern corner, in Imperial, said this is the first time the region has felt a direct effect of DOGE. Pankonin said the area shouldn’t feel an impact if the other offices tasked with the overnight shift can handle it. He ran the rural Imperial Republican newspaper and several nearby papers for years.
This isn’t the first DOGE cut to the Weather Service affecting Nebraska this year. 
In April, an NWS office in the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices announced pausing the deployment of weather balloons. That decision was reversed after some of the state’s federal delegation pushed back on those DOGE cuts. At the time, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he hoped to introduce legislation that would reclassify National Weather Service employees as public safety personnel because it would exempt them from future hiring freezes and buyouts.  Flood has since said the station is launching two weather balloons a day. 
However, the Omaha area NWS office has said it is still facing staffing issues.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
A 2024 “Housing Supply Gap Analysis” of North Carolina’s rental and for-sale housing supply funded by the NC Chamber Foundation found that the state faces a significant housing inventory gap across all income levels and geographic areas in the state

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Senate Bill 7 would allow for the creation of four overdose prevention centers in Connecticut. These are safe, supervised spaces where people can use their pre-obtained substances in the presence of trained staff who intervene in the event of an overdose. 
This bill (Raised as Senate Bill 1285) recently advanced to the floor after a vote in the Public Health Committee, where it passed almost along party lines. 9 Republicans opposed it, while 22 Democrats and 1 Republican voted in favor. Though divided in their votes, all members expressed deep concern for the lives impacted by addiction and overdose. This crisis touches nearly everyone, as many Americans know someone who has died from an overdose, leaving a wake of grief behind. 
At the heart of the debate lies a critical question: “Do overdose prevention centers help people get into treatment?” 
To address this, we must define what we mean by ‘treatment.’ 
Treatment as Abstinence? 
For many, “treatment” means complete abstinence from drug use. This belief is foundational to 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), which frame addiction as a disease best treated through lifelong abstinence, peer support, and spiritual principles. While some people do find long-term recovery through abstinence-based programs, research shows that such strict abstinence is not a viable path for everyone. Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition, and data suggest that about 70% of people with an opioid use disorder will relapse at some point. This is not a moral failure, it is the nature of the condition. 
Why does this matter? Because relapse, especially after a period of abstinence, drastically increases their risk of overdose. Individuals lose their drug tolerance, and the modern drug supply is increasingly contaminated with fentanyl and xylazine, making even small relapses deadly. If our goal is to reduce overdose deaths, we must acknowledge that abstinence alone does not work for most people and should not be the only option. 
Treatment as Detox and Rehab? 
Others equate treatment with detoxification (i.e., withdrawal management) and inpatient rehabilitation programs – often called detox and rehab. While these programs can be helpful, they are not sufficient on their own. Research shows that people with addiction have a chronic condition in which the median time from first to last use is 27 years. This underscores a critical point: Substance use is rarely an immediate, one-time problem that can be resolved through a short-term intervention like one visit to detox or rehab. For people with long drug use histories, expecting instant or permanent change is not only unrealistic but also harmful. When individuals repeatedly enter programs that do not work for them, they are often discharged back into environments that increase their overdose risk—particularly if they have lost tolerance. Without ongoing support, detoxes alone have low success rates—many people relapse soon after leaving, often returning to use at levels that increase overdose risk. Further, withdrawal and detoxification are incredibly difficult, leading to symptoms such as fever, vomiting, seizures, and hallucinations. Sadly, Rehab programs that do not integrate medication for opioid use disorder often have poor outcomes—one Connecticut-based study found that individuals who continued using opioids had similar or even lower overdose death rates than those who attended detox and rehab without medication support.
So, what does work? 
Treatment as Medication for Opioid Use Disorder? 
The gold standard of addiction treatment is MOUD, such as methadone and buprenorphine. These medications (1) reduce drug cravings, (2) stabilize withdrawal symptoms, and (3) lower one’s risk of relapse and overdose. Overdose prevention centers can serve as a critical bridge to evidence-based treatment, providing a low-barrier entry point where individuals can engage with professionals and learn about medications for opioid use disorder, mental health support, and social services. 
But what if “treatment” could be even broader than that? 
Treatment as Any Positive Change?
Overdose prevention centers operate on the harm reduction principle that any positive change is a step in the right direction. On any given day, a person visiting an overdose prevention center may not enter treatment as defined above (i.e., abstinence, rehab, detox, medication for opioid use disorder), but they do stay alive another day, connected to and supported by staff and peers who will help them with treatment if and when they make that step. 
Each visit represents a moment of stability, a chance to engage in community, ask questions about safer use and overdose prevention, and make decisions at their own pace. While on a given day, someone visiting an overdose prevention center may not enter treatment as traditionally defined, they become part of a community that instinctively loves and cares for them. They might return the next day, alive and knowing they are safe. This could be the day they start a conversation with a peer worker, receive a pamphlet about support groups, or make an appointment with a doctor for a health issue. Over time, they might learn about access to mental health specialists and social workers. Eventually, they might inquire about medication-assisted treatment like methadone.
Overdose prevention centers offer a safe space where individuals are empowered by the community and the choice to pursue what is right for them at that moment. They build trust within a system that supports their needs rather than punishes them. 
This process is not hypothetical — it is a documented reality.

Do Overdose Prevention Centers Get People into Treatment? 
Decades of evidence say yes. Overdose prevention centers already exist in countries such as Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, and Denmark. Research demonstrates overdose prevention centers increase engagement in treatment services (including medications for opioid use disorder, rehabilitation, detoxification, etc.) among people who use drugs, increase engagement with mental health care and healthcare systems in general (e.g., primary care), reduce overdose deaths, lower public drug use, and much more. New York City’s overdose prevention centers are already proving successful, offering wraparound services that acknowledge the complex realities of addiction — including trauma, mental health issues, and social barriers. 
Senate Bill 7: Crucial for Treatment of Substance Use in Connecticut 
Senate Bill 7 would create four pilot overdose prevention centers within existing service hubs, ensuring that visitors receive access to treatment options tailored to their individual needs—whether that means abstinence, medication for opioid use disorder, harm reduction, or social support. 
Rather than pushing an immediate “success-or-failure” model of treatment, overdose prevention centers acknowledge that recovery is a long-term process with many stages. While some individuals may take years to transition into traditional treatment, their first step may simply be staying alive long enough to make that choice. 
A common misconception is that overdose prevention centers “compete” with abstinence-based models like NA/AA. However, they complement these systems by meeting people where they are rather than demanding immediate abstinence. Some people will ultimately choose abstinence-based recovery. Some will choose MOUD and harm reduction. Some will take years to transition into formal treatment, but all deserve to live long enough to make that choice. 
Instead of arguing “which model is better?” we should ask: How can we expand recovery options so more people can survive and thrive? The evidence is clear: Overdose prevention centers are one of those options. 
Do OPCs help people get into treatment?
Yes—when we recognize that treatment means more than just abstinence. 
Yes—when we acknowledge that recovery is a process, not an on/off switch. 
Yes—when we focus on saving lives first, people have the chance to seek treatment when they are ready.

(Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images)Violent tornado outbreaks, like the storms that tore through parts of St. Louis and London, Kentucky, on May 16, have made 2025 seem like an especially active, deadly and destructive year for tornadoes.
The U.S. has had more reported tornadoes than normal — over 960 as of May 22, according to the National Weather Service’s preliminary count.
That’s well above the national average of around 660 tornadoes reported by that point over the past 15 years, and it’s similar to 2024 — the second-most active year over that same period.

I’m an atmospheric scientist who studies natural hazards. What stands out about 2025 so far isn’t just the number of tornadoes, but how Tornado Alley has encompassed just about everything east of the Rockies, and how tornado season is becoming all year.
 
Why has 2025 been so active?
The high tornado count in 2025 has a lot to do with the weather in March, which broke records with 299 reported tornadoes — far exceeding the average of 80 for that month over the past three decades.
March’s numbers were driven by two large tornado outbreaks: about 115 tornadoes swept across more than a dozen states March 14-16, stretching from Arkansas to Pennsylvania; and 145 tornadoes hit March 31 to April 1, primarily in a swath from Arkansas to Iowa and eastward. The 2025 numbers are preliminary pending final analyses.
While meteorologists don’t know for sure why March was so active, there were a couple of ingredients that favor tornadoes:

First, in March the climate was in a weak La Niña pattern, which is associated with a wavier and stormier jet stream and, often, with more U.S. tornadoes.
Second, the waters of the Gulf were much warmer than normal, which feeds moister air inland to fuel severe thunderstorms.

By April and May, however, those ingredients had faded. The weak La Niña ended and the Gulf waters were closer to normal.
April and May also produced tornado outbreaks, but the preliminary count over most of this period, since the March 31-April 1 outbreak, has actually been close to the average, though things could still change.
What has stood out in April and May is persistence: The jet stream has remained wavy, bringing with it the normal ebb and flow of stormy low-pressure weather systems mixed with sunny high-pressure systems. In May alone, tornadoes were reported in Colorado, Minnesota, Delaware, Florida and just about every state in between.
Years with fewer tornadoes often have calm periods of a couple of weeks or longer when a sunny high-pressure system is parked over the central U.S. However, the U.S. didn’t really get one of those calm periods in spring 2025.
 
Tornado Alley shifts eastward
The locations of these storms have also been notable: The 2025 tornadoes through May have been widespread but clustered near the lower and central Mississippi Valley, stretching from Illinois to Mississippi.
That’s well to the east of traditional Tornado Alley, typically seen as stretching from Texas through Nebraska, and farther east than normal. April through May is still peak season for the Mississippi Valley, though it is usually on the eastern edge of activity rather than at the epicenter. The normal seasonal cycle of tornadoes moves inland from near the Gulf Coast in winter to the upper Midwest and Great Plains by summer.
  Where local forecast centers reported tornadoes in 2025, through May 22. Data is preliminary, pending final analysis. (NOAA Storm Prediction Center)
Over the past few decades, the U.S. has seen a broad shift in tornadoes in three ways: to the east, earlier in the year and clustered into larger outbreaks.
Winter tornadoes have become more frequent over the eastern U.S., from the southeast, dubbed Dixie Alley for its tornado activity in recent years, to the Midwest, particularly Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
Meanwhile, there has been a steady and stark decline in tornadoes in the “traditional” tornado season and region: spring and summer in general, especially across the Great Plains.
It may come as a surprise that the U.S. has actually seen a decrease in overall U.S. tornado activity over the past several decades, especially for intense tornadoes categorized as EF2 and above. There have been fewer days with a tornado. However, those tornado days have been producing more tornadoes. These trends may have stabilized over the past decade.
 
Deadlier tornadoes
This eastward shift is likely making tornadoes deadlier.
Tornadoes in the Southeastern U.S. are more likely to strike overnight, when people are asleep and cannot quickly protect themselves, which makes these events dramatically more dangerous. The tornado that hit London, Kentucky, struck after 11 p.m. Many of the victims were over age 65.
The shift toward more winter tornadoes has also left people more vulnerable. Since they may not expect tornadoes at that time of year, they are likely to be less prepared. Tornado detection and forecasting is rapidly improving and has saved thousands of lives over the past 50-plus years, but forecasts can save lives only if people are able to receive them.
  Average number of tornadoes by month, 2000-2024. (NOAA)

This shift in tornadoes to the east and earlier in the year is very similar to how scientists expect severe thunderstorms to change as the world warms. However, researchers don’t know whether the overall downward trend in tornadoes is driven by warming or will continue into the future. Field campaigns studying how tornadoes form may help us better answer this question
 
Remember that it only takes one
For safety, it’s time to stop focusing on spring as tornado season and the Great Plains as Tornado Alley.
Tornado Alley is really all of the U.S. east of the Rockies and west of the Appalachians for most of the year. The farther south you live, the longer your tornado season lasts.
Forecasters say it every year for hurricanes, and we badly need to start saying it for tornadoes too: It only takes one to make it a bad season for you or your community. Just ask the residents of London, Kentucky; St. Louis; Plevna and Grinnell, Kansas; and McNairy County, Tennessee.
Listen to your local meteorologists so you will know when your region is facing a tornado risk. And if you hear sirens or are under a tornado warning, immediately go to your safe space. A tornado may already be on the ground, and you may have only seconds to protect yourself.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”

Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Rockville is one of three hospitals in Connecticut owned by Los Angeles-based Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in January. 
The settlement signed on Friday between Prospect and the state of Connecticut concludes an ongoing state investigation into unauthorized service cuts at Rockville launched in October of last year. Prospect agreed that Connecticut will have a $300,000 claim included in the bankruptcy case as a result of the termination of services, subject to approval by the court. 
The terms require Prospect to maintain emergency services at Rockville for three years and keep existing inpatient behavioral health services “at or within 30 miles of their current location on the RGH campus.” However, it doesn’t require the operator to reopen services that were cut without state permission. 
The agreement also grants Prospect permission from the state’s Office of Health Strategy, or OHS, to terminate Rockville’s status as a full-service acute care hospital and convert it into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. Prospect must now also obtain permission for the consolidation from the Department of Public Health, which oversees hospital licensing, Wendy Fuchs, a spokesperson for OHS confirmed. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. 
In a Friday press release, OHS Commissioner Deidre Gifford said the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital.  The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read.  
The agreement requires Prospect to announce the consolidation of Rockville with Manchester Memorial publicly, create an interim strategic plan for services at Rockville and hold a community forum within 60 days. 
Spokespeople with Prospect Medical Holdings and Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which owns Rockville General and Manchester Memorial, did not respond to a request for comment.
In March, Suzanne Koenig, a bankruptcy-court appointed patient care ombuds reported that, during a visit to Rockville General, she found that surgical services, as well as the intensive care and medical-surgical units at the hospital had remained closed since March 2020. The company did not receive state permission to permanently close any of those services in advance of doing so.
State law defines a termination of services as “the cessation of any services for a period greater than one hundred eighty days.” Termination of services by a hospital without state approval can result in civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day.
The unauthorized cuts were the subject of an October 2023 investigation by the Connecticut Mirror. 
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, state officials offered assurances that its three Connecticut hospitals would remain open and operating. 
​​“Some people think bankruptcy means the lights go out and the party’s over. That’s not true at all. These hospitals are very successful,” Lamont said during a press conference in the days following the bankruptcy announcement.
Although Rockville General will technically remain operational, it will no longer be a stand-alone, full-service acute care hospital. 
A spokesperson for Lamont did not return a request for comment. 
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, whose district contains Rockville General Hospital, said Friday that the state had failed her residents.
“Profit over people. That’s what I think we’ve come to expect here unfortunately from OHS and the state when it comes to health care for residents that are not in large cities,” Nuccio said. 
The agreement with the state will be binding for any future buyers of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals. 
Yale New Haven Health first reached a tentative agreement to purchase the three facilities from Prospect for $435 million in 2022. But the deal has been mired in complications since then, including lawsuits and, most recently, Prospect’s bankruptcy. In February, Yale said it would be “impossible” to close the deal.
An auction process for the Prospect-owned hospitals will take place through bankruptcy court. 
In the state’s Friday announcement, OHS said the process is “ongoing.” In court documents, the sale hearing was tentatively scheduled for June 5, but no notice of hearing has been officially posted and spokespeople for Prospect and their lawyers have not responded to multiple requests regarding the auction timeline.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 21:00:36.276697

The rule change went into effect May 17 and was announced Monday.
The move does not apply to federally protected Columbian white-tailed deer. Instead, it allows salvage of elk and black-tailed deer in the three counties with a Fish & Wildlife-issued roadkill salvage permit.
“We carefully reviewed available data and determined the risk of mistakenly salvaging Columbian white-tailed deer is low,” Kyle Garrison, the department’s ungulate section manager, said in the announcement.
It’s still illegal to salvage, handle or possess Columbian white-tailed deer in Washington. Fish & Wildlife asks salvagers to report when the remains of that species are found.
While eating roadkill can be dangerous, salvagers west of the Cascades have not had to worry about chronic wasting disease in dead animals.
“We have not had any cases of chronic wasting disease in southwest Washington,” said Britton Ransford, Fish & Wildlife’s spokesman for the region.
The department stressed that salvaging deer and elk is allowed only for animals killed in motor vehicle crashes. It also said anyone who takes possession of a carcass is required to obtain a free roadkill salvage permit within 24 hours.

Wednesday, Attorney General Austin Knudsen sent a letter to the Gallatin County Commis[...]","Gallatin County Courthouse in Bozeman. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Gallatin County Commissioner described a scalding letter from the attorney general about a local legal opinion as “political theater” and said Friday the county has had the longest-standing agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of any county in Montana.
Wednesday, Attorney General Austin Knudsen sent a letter to the Gallatin County Commissioners criticizing a legal opinion — which Knudsen put inside quotations as “legal opinion” — by Gallatin County Attorney Audrey Cromwell.
The April 24 opinion from Cromwell argued against entering into an agreement with ICE to detain undocumented immigrants from across the state at the Gallatin County Detention Center.
Cromwell said doing so would raise constitutional and legal questions and potentially cost taxpayers millions of dollars.
The Trump administration has been aggressive in pursuing, and in some cases deporting, immigrants nationwide, including in Montana, as the president pledged to do in his campaign.
In March, MTN News reported that ICE detained 17 immigrants it described as undocumented in Bigfork.
In some cases, judges have found authorities under Trump acted without due process and deported people illegally, including legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens. A New York Times analysis said illegal deportations are difficult to undo.
But immigration is a political hot button, and in his criticism of the Gallatin prosecutor, Knudsen said the American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House “to secure our border,” and Montanans want state officials to support his agenda, “not undermine it.”
“At its core, the Cromwell Opinion is an endorsement of the disastrous open border policies of the Biden administration,” Knudsen said in his letter.
In a 2024 report, the Pew Research Center said unauthorized immigrants hit a 12.2 million peak in 2007 and, after a downward trend, crept up again in recent years to 11.1 million in 2022, and likely higher since then.
“My office fought back against these destructive policies for four long years, and I refuse to stand by as feckless left-wing prosecutors attempt to subvert the will of the people and put dangerous criminals back on the streets,” Knudsen wrote.
In response, Cromwell said in a statement that Gallatin County already participates in a program, known as the federal 287(g) program, that ensures “undocumented individuals charged with a crime in Gallatin County are immediately flagged and held for ICE.”
The 287(g) program authorizes local law enforcement officials to perform specific immigration duties under the agency’s oversight.
“Given constitutional concerns regarding due process, significant legal liability, and added strain on overburdened County resources, I stand by my legal opinion, which advises the Commission against entering into an additional agreement with ICE to detain non-local undocumented immigrants in the Gallatin County Detention Center,” Cromwell said.
Her legal opinion said earlier this year, a court found Suffolk County in New York responsible for $60 million in a class action lawsuit that found unconstitutional detention practices of undocumented immigrants. The county is appealing the decision, according to a local news report.
Gallatin County Commissioners said they already cooperate with ICE on immigration and will “continue to work closely with the Gallatin County Attorney, who was elected by our community.”
“And we will continue supporting the Sheriff and his dedicated team of public safety heroes,” Commissioners said in a statement.
In an interview Friday, Gallatin County Commissioner Zach Brown said under the existing agreement, Gallatin County already temporarily holds detainees for ICE to pick up when an immigration flag comes up during booking.
“That’s a legal framework that is in place and has been in place for a long time,” Brown said.
Cromwell’s opinion said 1.4% of the county jail population has been flagged for ICE holds over the last year.
Brown also said he wanted to cut through some of the rhetoric around immigration. For one, Brown said the president and the attorney general are conflating civil and criminal law — and doing so “intentionally.”
In other words, he said, local government and county law enforcement handle criminal offenses, but federal civil procedures govern people whose immigration status is questioned.
County facilities and services aren’t designed, funded or empowered to execute federal civil procedures, he said. Rhetoric, including from President Trump, implies that every illegal person is a criminal, he said, but that’s not necessarily true.
“If someone has an immigration issue, that does not make them inherently a criminal under American federal law,” Brown said.
However, he also said Gallatin County has made “record investments” in public safety, including in salaries, new positions, and equipment, and resources for the drug task force, courts, “and on and on.”
“That trajectory and commitment to law enforcement is really strong with this commission and within this community,” Brown said.
In February, MTN News reported ICE agents arrested six alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Gallatin County. At the time, Sheriff Dan Springer told MTN News law enforcement had been working to combat the gang and had been successful given no violent incidents had been reported.
Springer could not be reached by voicemail Friday for an update.
Cromwell’s opinion said those people were held solely on ICE detainers and not on criminal charges, and the situation demonstrates the risk that counties may inadvertently hold people without due process.
Brown also pointed to statistics that show Gallatin County has the second lowest crime rate among urban counties in Montana, only behind Flathead County.
Citing the Montana Board of Crime Control, he said Gallatin had 540 incidents per 10,000 in 2023, the most recent data available, compared to 1,100 per 10,000 in Cascade County, reporting the highest number per capita.

Brown also said that at its root, immigration is squarely a federal issue, and an argument about a county contract, “a minor, minor issue,” is a distraction from the fact that Congress hasn’t taken action on immigration reform since 1986.
“It’s infuriating that these issues are getting talked about at the local government level. Just that, in and of itself, is political theater,” Brown said.
He said local government is at the behest of the federal government when it comes to immigration, it’s experienced whiplash upon changes in administration, and it will continue without action.
“Congress is allowing the executive branch to make policy on immigration law, and that’s not the executive’s job under the constitution and our form of government,” Brown said.
He called on Montana’s congressional delegation to legislate, and he said the dispute over the additional agreement between ICE and Gallatin County is just a symptom of the disease.
“The cancer in the system is Congress’ inaction. So Congress needs to get off their butt and do their job,” Brown said.
U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy are from Bozeman in Gallatin County and could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday. However, in remarks three weeks ago and posted on his Facebook page, Daines said presidential leadership matters.
He said law enforcement officers in Bozeman told him they weren’t getting any response from ICE under the Biden administration, and that changed right after Trump was sworn into office.
“Within 30 days, those ICE agents swarmed and got those TDA (Tren de Aragua) guys apprehended and deported from our country. That directly affects my hometown of Bozeman,” Daines said.
In his letter, Knudsen, said the “horrors aren’t hypothetical.” In his letter, he said under the Biden administration, the state Crime Lab reported 262 fentanyl-linked deaths in Montana, and he said 100% of illicit fentanyl seized in Montana is trafficked across the border.
“In one Gallatin County operation conducted in March, three illegal immigrants were arrested on drug-related charges and methamphetamine, cocaine, cash and four vehicles were seized,” Knudsen said.
He also said earlier this year, the Eastern Montana High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area seized 9,400 carfentanil pills in Billings, just a couple of hours away from Gallatin County. He said carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, “making it even more dangerous and deadly.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2234-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

A state-funded scientific research institute. Exempting service workers’ tips from state income tax.
Those are among the hundreds of proposals California lawmakers swiftly rejected Friday under the banner of cost savings, as they cited the state’s $12 billion budget deficit — a worsening figure due to the threat of unprecedented federal funding cuts and California’s ballooning spending on health care for low-income residents. 
“We are in (a) very difficult budget environment this year, so consequently many good bills are going to fall by the wayside today,” said Assembly Appropriations Committee Chair Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, before beginning that chamber’s hearing. 
“We are not in a year where we can be expanding programs, developing new offices, new agencies, new departments, and expanding our footprints.”
The Friday procedure is known as the “suspense file” — the state Legislature’s most secretive and fast-paced biannual hearing, where the chairs of the Assembly and Senate Appropriations committees quickly shoot down pricey proposals with little explanation, often acting more aggressively during years of budget woes. 
The suspense files are where the appropriations committees send bills that would cost the state at least $50,000 in the Senate and $150,000 in the Assembly. The process was originally a way for lawmakers to consider policy proposals that cost the state money together by balancing them against each other. 
But the well-accepted open secret in Sacramento is that it’s also an opportunity for lawmakers to quietly kill controversial bills, appease powerful special interests or just winnow down the number of bills they’ll have to debate on the floor. Lawmakers decide ahead of time, in secret, whether to pass the bills to the full Senate or Assembly, or to withhold them. The public hearings are a rapid-fire announcement of the decisions.
On Friday, the Senate Appropriations Committee axed 29% of the 432 bills on its list, although it kept a handful of those alive to work on next year. That’s more aggressive trimming than the committee did last May. 
“The state is facing a significant budget deficit and with that in mind, the committee had to make difficult choices on a number of bills to reduce costs,” said Senate Appropriations Chairperson Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, before the hearing. She opened the hearing with a defense of the arcane proceedings, explaining that the results would be posted online, but rushed out to catch a flight after the meeting without discussing her approach with reporters. 
The Assembly Appropriations Committee killed 35% of the 666 measures on its suspense file, similar to last year. Lawmakers had been warned to keep the cost of their proposals down, Wicks said. 
“We stressed heavily to members as they were putting together their legislative package this year to be very mindful of cost,” she told reporters.
The state’s fiscal future is anything but certain: As federal threats loom, Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month rolled out a $322 billion spending plan that included significant cuts to Medi-Cal, the state’s health care system for low-income Californians, and a 3% cut to public universities. 
Health care expansions on the chopping block
On Friday, some Assembly measures that would have expanded health care services for Californians met their fate. That includes Wicks’ own proposal seeking federal approval to qualify some housing services as Medi-Cal benefits, a $40 million endeavor that Newsom previously vetoed. The committee also killed a proposal to allow more Medi-Cal enrollees to receive home-based care and another that would have allowed higher-earning immigrants in the country illegally to purchase insurance plans on Covered California, the state-run health care marketplace.

In the Senate, lawmakers shelved a proposal by Sen. Catherine Blakespear to impose campaign contribution limits on candidates for judicial office and school board races, which the influential California Teachers Association opposed. They axed Sen. Henry Stern’s proposal to expand the state’s contentious new mental health program CARE Courts to include defendants with bipolar disorder I, and Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil’s bill to address mountain lion interactions that has pitted rural communities against animal rights and wildlife conservation advocates. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee also killed two Republican tough-on-crime proposals, showing the limits of Democrats’ recent shift slightly rightward on crime. Until Friday, it had been surprisingly smooth sailing this year for Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones’ bill to block sex offenders from being released from prison through the state’s elderly parole program, and Sen. Kelly Seyarto’s bill to increase penalties for selling or giving fentanyl to minors.
The law enforcement-backed bills were opposed by criminal justice reform advocates, who still hold sway with the majority party and often argue it would be too costly for the state to imprison more people. 
In a statement, Jones, a San Diego Republican, called the suspense file process “anti-democratic” and accused Democrats of “silencing the voices of victims and the public.”
Some measures are now postponed until next year. That includes two Assembly measures seeking tighter regulations on ticket sales for sports and musical events, amid fierce opposition from ticketing platforms such as Stubhub and from local chambers of commerce. The measures would restrict when those platforms can resell tickets, strengthen the disclosure of ticket information and require venues to accept proof of purchase as tickets. 
Assm. Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat who authored one of the measures, said Wicks never articulated her concerns with his proposal, even though Wicks told reporters Friday her staff had been in touch with Bryan’s office. “There was never an attempt to discuss the bill,” which led him to believe her concerns had been alleviated, Bryan said in a statement. 
Lawmakers also pushed off some issues to be debated further during budget negotiations between the Legislature and Newsom. That process will accelerate in the coming weeks before a mid-June deadline to pass a balanced budget. 
Newsom’s film tax credit pushed to budget talk
They stripped out language in both Assembly and Senate bills to more than double the state’s film tax credit to $750 million. Newsom has pushed hard for the tax credit expansion to help the ailing Los Angeles industry and keep production in state, and he’s included the money in his budget proposals which lawmakers will debate separately. 
Assemblymember Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat who authored the Assembly version of the measure, said the committee move was merely a technical one to separate budget allocations from policy changes. 
“The increase in the size of the program will happen in the budget,” Zbur said. “I’m not that nervous about it.”
But to others, the move indicated that some lawmakers remain skeptical of spending so much on the program. Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat who sponsored the Senate bill to boost the tax credits, said he was “certainly disappointed.”
“It’s something we are going to push back against as budget negotiations begin to heat up,” he said in a statement.
An ambitious and highly technical proposal by Sen. Scott Wiener reining in the landmark California Environmental Quality Act to make it harder for opponents of development to sue to block housing projects also will be debated in the budget process.
In the Senate Appropriations Committee, lawmakers passed the bill but Caballero said they would continue negotiating it to help the state meet its housing needs “without compromising environmental protections.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052325_Suspense-Day_FG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants — often children — regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.
But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.
The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Trump’s domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.
The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.
Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.
Two of the states — Utah and Illinois — have “trigger” laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.
The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.
Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding — about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.
California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Trump’s legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.
“We need to stand our ground,” he said. “California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we’re not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Trump’s bill would devastate health care in his state.
“Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,” Newsom said.
In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state’s Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.
Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.
Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.
“We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,” he said. Dunnigan wouldn’t say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.
Utah’s program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah’s Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.
Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.
“There are no great alternatives, politically,” he said. “It’s a prisoner’s dilemma — a move in either direction does not make much sense.”
Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.
Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.
“This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,” Slonaker said.
In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That’s because it could lead to 770,000 adults’ losing the health coverage they gained under the state’s Medicaid expansion.
Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it’s possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. “It would be a hard situation, obviously,” she said.
Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.
She said the provision shows Republicans’ “hostility against immigrants” and that “they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.”
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as “an open doormat,” inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.
A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Trump’s overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.
The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, helping reduce the national uninsured rate to a historic low.
The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.
In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government’s contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.
By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.
The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.
Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to “support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.”
Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a “red herring” because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.
The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.
The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees’ eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.
The bill would also freeze states’ practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.
The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.
The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.

Mental health day
Lawmakers commemorated the third annual Mental Health and Wellness Day on Tuesday and used the occasion to highlight some of the bills they are working on this session. Rep. Kai Belton, D-Middletown, who led a press conference, said she wanted to create a “space for healing and support and for connection” when she started the mental health and wellness fair.
Among the bills on the table, H.B. 7158 would require health care providers treating minor patients to send a safety plan to that child’s school with the consent of their parent or guardian, and develop a discharge plan in a timely manner from inpatient facilities.
Rep. Tammy Exum, D-West Hartford, said the pandemic brought the children’s behavioral health crisis to the forefront. “Children should not have to leave the state of Connecticut to get the care that they needed.”— Laura Tillman, Human Services Reporter
Multifamily housing bans
The state House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that would ban towns from temporary pauses on multifamily housing constructions, a measure that aims to ensure municipalities don’t use zoning to ban apartment construction outright.
Trumbull has a moratorium in place that has stretched on for six years. Ridgefield has been trying to get one. Towns sometimes say they’re using these plans to pause applications while they plan where they want to put apartments or affordable housing.
“We believe that this leads to a shortage of housing in areas that really really need housing that’s more affordable, need better places for people to live,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, on the pauses.
Republicans opposed the measure, saying it would weaken local control. “I also worry about single-family housing,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe. “By not addressing it in this bill, we are saying that a town could ban single-family housing.”
The bill next heads to the Senate for a vote.— Ginny Monk, Housing & Children’s Issues Reporter
Net equality
The Senate passed a bill on Wednesday by a 29 to 7 majority that seeks to create more affordable internet access for low-income Connecticut residents. Senate Bill 514, as amended on Wednesday, would encourage broadband providers to offer a $40 per month plan for broadband internet, which would include all taxes and fees. Residents who are enrolled in SNAP would qualify.
Under the amended bill broadband internet providers that offer an affordable option would be given preference in state contracts, creating a “more stick than carrot approach,” Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, said. “It’s not saying you need to do this to get a state contract, you could still win one without opting into this program, however it does give you preference in winning a state contract,” he said.
During the Senate discussion on Wednesday, Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven asked if the bill would spur an increase on internet rates for users who don’t qualify. Maroney said he didn’t believe so because most companies already provide a low cost service. The bill now heads to the House.

Serving green crabs
One of Connecticut’s most invasive species could soon find its path to the dinner plate eased under legislation approved by lawmakers on Thursday. The Senate gave unanimous approval to House Bill 6222, which would allow restaurants to serve invasive green crabs and other “bait” species without obtaining a license from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
The tiny crabs, which arrived from Europe and can wreak havoc on native habitats, are currently on the menu at The Shipwright’s Daughter, a James-Beard-award-winning restaurant in Mystic.
David Standridge, the executive chef and partner at the restaurant, told lawmakers in written testimony earlier this year that he has to import the crabs from Rhode Island due to the regulations in Connecticut. “Luckily we can eat our way out of this problem as green crabs have a very high culinary value,” he said.
In addition to easing the rules for restaurants to serve up green crabs, the bill also authorizes the Department of Agriculture to study lowering the minimum harvest size of oysters below the current standard of three inches. While some proponents pointed to consumers’ preference for smaller oysters, members of Connecticut’s oyster industry have argued in support of the current minimums, which they said help maintain the health of the species in Long Island Sound.
The bill previously passed the House, and now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter
Scholarships for aspiring teachers
A bill that would broaden scholarship eligibility for aspiring educators passed unanimously out of the Senate Thursday. Senate Bill 1513 would reframe what was known as the Aspiring Educators Diversity Scholarship Program.
The scholarship currently offers up to $10,000 annually to graduates from priority school districts — the top 10 lowest performing districts in the state — who are now seeking to become educators. The new proposal would open the scholarship to anyone becoming a teacher who comes from “a population subgroup that is underrepresented in the teaching profession in Connecticut and has been identified as a teacher shortage area under state law,” according to an Office of Legislative Research bill analysis.
The bill is expected to incentivize more people to enter the teaching profession as it hits critical staffing levels, lawmakers said earlier this legislative session.

Recovery Day
Lawmakers shared personal stories on Thursday of how they and their families have been touched by addiction and recovery. Surrounded by groups that support people in recovery across Connecticut, Rep. Robin Comey, D-Branford, Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, Rep. Bill Heffernan, D-West Haven, Rep, Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, and Rep. Devin Carney, R-Old Saybrook, Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton and others.
Heffernan said that as a state representative, he goes to a million meetings, but, “The most important meetings I go to begin with me standing up and saying, ‘My name’s Bill, and I’m an alcoholic.'”
Carney, who said he had not planned to speak, shared that his father had died of addiction. “Throughout my whole childhood he was an addict,” Carney said. “People in recovery can do anything. They can be executives, they can be teachers, they can be doctors, and they can be elected officials in this building. And I’m one of them.”
Statewide efforts to support people in recovery with job, housing, counseling and other supports are showing promising signs of success. Overdose deaths fell across the U.S. in 2024, which is reflected in Connecticut’s statistics.— Laura Tillman, Human Services Reporter
Pay hikes for CT troopers
The state Senate unanimously approved an agreement Thursday granting 885 unionized state police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year. The House of Representatives approved the raises earlier in the week by a 134-12 margin.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010. Nearly all unionized state workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials not to award matching raises to other unions. That’s because they would have to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees even though the legislature approved such raises for troopers.— Keith M. Phaneuf, State Budget Reporter
Street takeovers
The House paused discussion on a bill meant to increase penalties for people involved in street takeovers after several Republicans argued over provisions for seizing and destroying ATVs.
The bill allows towns and cities to adopt ordinances against street takeovers and to fine drivers and revoke or suspend the licenses of those who participate. Under the bill, a municipality would be allowed to destroy ATVs and dirt-bikes that were seized by the police after violating municipal ordinances if the owner does not claim the vehicles within 30 days.
The largest point of contention was how to identify the owners of ATVs after they were seized by the police. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, noted that the municipalities who supported this bill wanted a way to dispose of the vehicles, which they were currently required to hold onto or auction. But Fishbein said many of the vehicles used at street takeovers are stolen, which makes it hard for the police to identify the owners, and possibly requiring the municipality to hold onto the vehicle indefinitely.
Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, said he felt the ordinances would be difficult to enforce in smaller towns. The amendment failed on party lines.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Traffic stops
Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to reinstate police officers’ ability to conduct consent searches in motor vehicles during a Senate debate Thursday. Senate Minority Leader Steve Harding, R-Brookfield, offered an amendment to a bill changing some of the laws around secondary traffic stops.
The bill would remove several equipment violations from a list of legal infractions for which Connecticut motorists can be pulled over, including a broken headlight; having license plates displayed in a rear window, but “plainly legible”; or having a windshield ornament or sticker, as long as it doesn’t “significantly block or conceal” the driver’s ability to see. It also allows a police officer to pull over drivers who they see consuming a cannabis product and smell its “burnt odor.”
Harding’s amendment would have allowed police officers to search a vehicle if the officer has “reasonable and articulable suspicion that weapons, contraband or other evidence of a crime is contained within the vehicle.” Harding argued that police officers saw consent searches, which were prohibited under the 2020 Police Accountability Act, as the most effective way of finding illegal drugs and weapons. 
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, disagreed, saying the idea of anticipating crimes and preventing them in advance was “chilling in our democracy.” The amendment failed 12-24 on party lines. The bill passed unanimously.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
LGBTQ rights at nursing homes
A bill intended to promote LGBTQ rights among nursing home patients exposed intra-party differences in the General Assembly among House and Senate Republicans. The bill, which was amended in the House to draw bipartisan support, won final passage Thursday in the Senate on a 26-10 vote, with every Democrat in favor and every Republican save one in opposition.
It was a different story in the House, where the bill passed on a 124-19 vote, with every Democrat and 27 Republicans in favor, including House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. The House Republicans became more comfortable with the bill after an amendment struck a provision that states that a transgender patient could not be refused a room or be forcibly transferred if another patient objected to a trans roommate.
Recommended by the state’s long-term care ombudsman, the bill affirms and requires public notice in nursing homes that state and federal law prohibits discrimination on any number of counts, among them sexual orientation, HIV status and “gender identity and expression.”
The bill requires facilities, at least every two years, to provide direct-care workers with cultural competency training focused on residents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender-nonconforming, or are living with HIV. The training materials must be developed by the commissioner of public health by January.

Energy bill gets one step closer
The Appropriations Committee gave its approval Friday to Democrats’ signature bill addressing Connecticut’s energy affordability crisis, even as lawmakers were continuing to hammer out the details of the measure.
Earlier in the week, negotiators revealed their latest draft of the legislation, Senate Bill 4, which they said could lower electricity prices by around 5% by borrowing money to pay for portions of the public benefits charge. The latest draft was quickly advanced by the Appropriations Committee on a party-line vote Friday. Republicans objected to the fact that the bill and its costs had not yet been worked into the state’s budget.
Members of that committee, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and stakeholders were continuing to hold meetings on Friday to discuss further revisions to the bill. An initial vote in the Senate is expected some time next week.

Federal public health changes
The Senate passed an omnibus bill that proponents say is meant to guard the state against potential changes to public health policy by the federal government.
The megabill contains provisions to guarantee in state law the current federal standard for the level of fluoride in drinking water and access to emergency reproductive services, including miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy treatment. It also creates a “safe harbor” account, to be managed by the state Treasurer and funded exclusively through private donations, to cover out-of-pocket costs for people who come to Connecticut from other states seeking reproductive or gender-affirming care. Additionally, it would create accounts for the Department of Public Health to use in the case of federal public health funding shortfalls, but does not include a funding source for those accounts. Some Republicans criticized the bill as jumping ahead and legislating in advance of situations that may never happen.
Outside of the measures that directly respond to potential federal changes, the legislation also seeks to establish overdose prevention centers that include safe injection sites and creates a program to promote pancreatic cancer screenings. The legislation now moves to the House for final passage.

“It's universal in the committee that we support the town's position on their ability to maintain — or not maintain — these trails,” said Rep. Matt Walker, the House Transportation chair.

Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House Transportation Committee, listens as the committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Feb. 12. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA proposal that’s ping-ponged between two different transportation-related bills in recent weeks could impact a judge’s ruling in a yearslong, costly court battle over public access to a trail in Tunbridge. But only if the bill that includes that measure, the miscellaneous motor vehicle bill, crosses the finish line before the end of the session.The DMV bill, S.123, as voted out of the House Transportation Committee, seeks to clarify that municipalities have the authority to maintain so-called “legal trails,” though are not required to do so. “Legal trails” are former public roads that remain open for recreational uses. There are more than 500 miles of these trails, largely in small segments, across the state.Depending on who you ask, state law already grants municipalities that authority. But differing views on that have been at the center of a more than four year dispute between the Town of Tunbridge and a local landowner who’s sought to limit cyclists’ use of a legal trail that runs across his property. Town officials have said it’s up to them what uses are allowed on the trail.A judge has yet to resolve the case. But the language recently added to this year’s DMV bill could lead the court to decide the Legislature has, effectively, resolved the question on its own — though that’s far from a guarantee, according to an attorney who advises the House and Senate transportation committees. As now up for consideration by the full House, S.123 states “it is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify municipalities’ authority to exclusively or cooperatively maintain legal trails.” “There is the potential that the current case gets dismissed,” said Damien Leonard, an attorney with the Office of Legislative Counsel, during a committee hearing earlier this month.The language in S.123 has, much like a hike, taken a circuitous route with several starts and stops. Similar language started the session in a separate bill, S.4, that did not make it off the wall in Senate Transportation before the “crossover” deadline for approval in mid-March.The following month, Senate Transportation added language on local trail jurisdiction into this year’s transportation funding bill, H.488, after that bill had already cleared the House. But legislative leaders later nixed the measure from the bill during a conference committee.At that point, the motor vehicle bill — which had already passed the Senate — was in House Transportation. The committee held onto the bill to take testimony about the legal trails issue, ultimately deciding to add in similar language to what was, for a time, in the T-bill. House leadership expects to take up the DMV bill next Tuesday, according to Conor Kennedy, chief of staff to Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington. It’s possible the bill would need to go to a conference committee after that.“It’s universal in the committee that we support the town’s position on their ability to maintain — or not maintain — these trails,” said Swanton Republican Rep. Matt Walker, the House Transportation chair, in an interview this week.A number of outdoor recreation advocacy groups, as well as the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, have also backed clarifying the law.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe Vermont Senate voted on Friday evening to approve its version of this year’s landmark education reform bill, H.454. The decision came just before 6:30 p.m., after hours of discussion on the floor and days of debate in committee hearings and other meetings behind the scenes this week in the Statehouse.The Senate’s bill largely mirrors the version that the House passed last month, though with some changes that senators indicated may need to be worked out in a committee of conference in the coming days. The vote was not unanimous, but it was taken by voice, so individual senators’ votes weren’t on the record.Read more about the debate here.— Shaun RobinsonAfter an hours-long debate on Friday afternoon, the Vermont House advanced a major housing package that would set up a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports new residential development.The largely party-line vote over S.127 comes after more than a week of discord among House lawmakers over the marquee infrastructure program, and it follows the Senate’s passage of a separate housing package a day prior.

If passed, the law would take effect in 2027. “It’s time to end the era where children’s wellbeing is collateral damage in the pursuit of profit,” Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, said ahead of Friday’s vote. The bill still requires final House approval, a vote that is expected next week. The legislation then heads back to the Senate, which needs to sign off on amendments to the bill, before heading to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk for his signature. — Habib SabetAlso, the Senate gave preliminary approval on Friday to legislation that would ban smartphones from Vermont classrooms. H.480, a bill of miscellaneous amendments to Vermont’s education laws, includes language that would require all of Vermont’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students’ cell-phones and other personal devices, like smartwatches, during the school day. The bans would need to go into effect in time for the 2026-2027 school year. The legislation also allows students to enroll in career technical education (CTE) facilities outside of their districts, as well as a requirement that school districts develop response plans in cases of student cardiac arrest.The bill still requires final Senate approval, which will likely come next week, before heading back to the House for a final sign off. — Habib SabetVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Vermont lawmakers consider a proposal that could impact long-running Tunbridge trail dispute.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house-transportation-4-20250212-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

Photo by Brian Stevenson/Vermont PublicThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.After an hours-long debate on Friday afternoon, the Vermont House advanced a major housing package that would set up a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports new residential development.The largely party-line vote over S.127 comes after more than a week of discord among House lawmakers over the marquee infrastructure program, and it follows the Senate’s passage of a separate housing package a day prior. That makes the path to a final product uncertain as the Legislature inches closer to adjourning.The debate in the Democrat-controlled House centered on what guardrails lawmakers ought to place on the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, a new initiative aimed at allowing municipalities and developers to use the increased tax revenue from new housing projects to pay back debt for infrastructure like water lines, sewers and sidewalks.After advancing the bill out of committee last week, House lawmakers faced blowback from Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, senators and housing advocates, who said House members had made access to the program too restrictive, particularly for smaller towns. In response to that criticism, key committee leaders put forward an amendment to ease some of those rules, like taking away geographic criteria for where projects could go and adding a pathway to exceed an annual cap on tax increment a state board can approve each year, at the discretion of the governor.But many House members felt those concessions did not go far enough. Members of the tripartisan rural caucus brought forward an additional amendment on the House floor on Friday which would, among other measures, strike a controversial “but for” test included in the legislation.READ MORE
The test, a common feature for tax increment financing programs elsewhere in the country, essentially requires that a development can only be approved for the program if it wouldn’t happen “but for” the public financing boost.Proponents of the test said it would play a critical role in protecting the state’s overstretched Education Fund.“If the development would have occurred anyway, or would have occurred somewhere else, then the retention of the statewide education property tax to pay for it is effectively foregone revenue from the Education Fund, which could actually end up increasing property taxes for all Vermonters,” said Rep. Charlie Kimbell, D-Woodstock, on the House floor.But opponents argued that the test amounts to an added barrier to housing development amid Vermont’s acute shortage of homes. The state needs upwards of 24,000 additional year-round homes by 2029 to achieve a healthy housing market, according to a report released last year. “The ‘but-for’ test is bureaucratic red tape,” said Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford. “The need for housing is self-evident.” The amendment to scrap the test failed, even after gaining the support of some rural Democrats, in addition to Republicans – 53 members voted for it, and 86 voted against. Some members who voted for the shot-down amendment ultimately voted in favor of the overall bill, expressing a desire to see it tweaked yet again in a committee of conference between the House and Senate.But it’s still unclear which housing bill will make it to that near-final step. As senators watched the House delay a vote over S.127 on Thursday, its members took the dramatic step of suspending all rules to get their version of a housing package, H.479, to the finish line – a move that required cross-party support. That bill contains a version of CHIP with fewer rules attached.Staff for legislative leadership indicated late Friday that they did not yet know which bill would be the ultimate vehicle. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Divided lawmakers keep housing bill hobbling toward finish line .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charles-Kimball-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved Gov. Kim Reynolds’ waiver to exclude foods like candy and soft drinks from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in Iowa. 
Anti-hunger advocates were against the waiver and argue it would not help low-income Iowans gain better access to nutritious foods. 
Reynolds, who appeared on “Iowa Press” Friday, said the demonstration waiver is a “really good first step” to return SNAP to its original intent of providing nutritious food to low-income families. 
“We are an unhealthy population,” Reynolds said. “We think this really lines up with the intent of what SNAP was designed for in the beginning, and they can use those dollars to purchase healthy foods and help supplement their family income.”

The waiver, which Reynolds submitted in March, excludes any food item eligible for sales tax, as determined by the Iowa Department of Revenue. This includes soft drinks, candy, and sweetened snacks, including granola bars and fruit leathers. 
The waiver would take effect Jan. 1, 2026, and last for two years. The federal Food and Nutrition Service will work with the state to implement the new definition of eligible food items and then evaluate the demonstration project and its impact on SNAP participants. 
Nicole McAlexander, vice chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition and executive director of Southeast Linn Community Center, said the waiver will increase stigma and “perpetuate misconceptions” around SNAP participants.
“Instead of investing in evidence-based solutions to improve healthy eating, the state of Iowa is choosing to experiment on low-income Iowans’ grocery carts,” McAlexander said.
Members of the coalition advocated for increased funding to the Double Up Food Bucks program, which allows SNAP recipients to double their spending on produce, but proposed bills did not advance in Iowa’s legislative session.
Luke Elzinga, board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said the waiver will “do nothing” to lower the cost of nutritious food for Iowans. Elzinga also questioned how the action fit with Reynolds’ approved waiver for Iowa’s summer feeding program, Healthy Kids Iowa.
“If Gov. Reynolds’ opposition to participating in Summer EBT was the lack of nutritional focus,” Elzinga said. “Why didn’t she elect to submit a similar restriction waiver for Summer EBT and participate in the program?”
Iowa Hunger Coalition said Reynolds’ summer program will assist just 65,000 kids, as opposed to the federal program which would have supported nearly 245,000 Iowa school-aged students in low-income families. 
Reynolds, when asked about the figure on “Iowa Press,” said her program allots $40 per eligible student, but families will be able to get more food with their dollars since the program distributes through food banks, versus individual electronic benefit transfer cards. 
“And, again, it restricts it to nutritious food,” Reynolds said. “We’re driving healthy outcomes, healthy behaviors in the state so that we can help families provide the kids nutritious food during the summer.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed similar SNAP-related waivers in Nebraska and Indiana this week. She congratulated the states for stepping up and taking action following her requests to “innovate” at the state level. 
“President Trump has given our nation a once in a generation opportunity to change the health trajectory for our entire country,” Rollins said. “I look forward to signing even more waivers in the days ahead as we continue to restore the health of America.” 
The waivers follow guidance from the Trump administration to reduce disease trends, including prediabetes trends in children, which were highlighted in the recent Make America Healthy Again report.

(File/Getty Images)South Carolina’s state-owned utility company and the electric cooperatives it serves are feuding over the power bill for a long-time Google data center in the Lowcountry.
At stake in the business dispute is between $16 million and $24 million annually, according to lawyers for the two utility groups.
The cooperatives say that’s a savings that could be divided out among all of their roughly 2 million customers statewide to reduce their power bills. Santee Cooper argues it’s a cost that could increase the power bill of their 200,000 direct customers, located in Berkeley, Georgetown and Horry counties.
The question is over which group of customers pays, who saves and how the state-owned utility’s financials are impacted.
“This $16 million or $44 million over a couple of years is a big issue because it matters to the people at the end of the line,” said Central Electric Power Cooperative CEO Rob Hochstetler, whose organization negotiates rates and supplies power on behalf of cooperatives statewide.
The disagreement, discussed at a joint meeting held Friday in West Columbia, came about as cooperatives had sought to use a provision in the long-term contract it holds with Santee Cooper that gives the cooperatives the option to buy power for a lower rate for large industrial users — in this case a Google data center in Berkeley County that has been in operation since 2007.
Google announces $3.3B investment in SC data centers, 200 new jobs

But Santee Cooper says the size of that data center — which uses upwards of 380 megawatts of power — is too large and the rate reduction will cost the power company too much money, creating a “grossly unfair and unjust burden” to Santee Cooper and its customers. By comparison, all of Santee Cooper’s current industrial customers use about 379 megawatts in total, attorney Carmen Thomas said.
Instead, Santee Cooper wants the cooperatives to renegotiate new terms rather than using those included in the existing contract.
“What that really amounts to is saying, ‘You guys need to take something less than your contract entitles you to,’ ” said Alex Hall, the attorney for the cooperatives. “Not liking the implications of a counterparty exercising his contractual rights is not a valid reason for refusal. That’s not how contracts work.”
While the data center may use a lot of power, it had already paid the cost of the power lines it required. Plus, the $16 million to $24 million in question only amounts to about 1% of Santee Cooper’s $1.9 billion in total operating revenue.
Besides, Santee Cooper and cooperatives already reached an agreement on the matter back in January. Santee Cooper had already signed, Hall said.
The cooperatives held off on signing as the two groups continued to negotiate other matters related to charges racked up during a court-mandated Santee Cooper rate freeze that recently expired. But had they not waited, Berl Davis Jr. of Palmetto Electric Cooperative said, the issue would not have been up for argument now.
Thomas said Santee Cooper considered those previous documents to be draft agreements, not final.
She also argued the cooperatives’ right to a reduced rate “is not unilateral,” saying the provisions for this particular type of rate allow Santee Cooper to negotiate when it comes to “large and unusual loads.”
“That right does not exist in a vacuum,” she said.
Hochstetler and Santee Cooper President Jimmy Stanton closed the meeting with mutual vows to resolve the contract dispute in the coming months.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

While the Berkeley County data center has been around for nearly two decades, such centers have dominated the conversation around energy needs in South Carolina as the state has grappled with how to meet the power demand of a growing population and manufacturing based, in addition to the new centers being built by tech giants such as Google, Meta and Blox.
Santee Cooper’s governing board, last month, even enacted a new rate meant to ensure energy-intensive data centers, built to serve the country’s ever-growing technology needs, are covering the cost of generating the massive amount of power they require.
The “experimental” rate will be in place for the next four years, testing it out before considering whether to make the policy permanent.
But that rate for new customers doesn’t apply to the 18-year-old Google data center.
Under Santee Cooper’s new rate, large users will be charged at a rate similar to Santee Cooper’s existing industrial users. The difference is those customers must sign a 15-year contract, one they can’t get out of without paying a set minimum. The utility also will charge more for power used at times of day when demand for energy is at its highest.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Iowa’s U.S. House delegation, who voted this week in favor of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” have been defending and promoting their decision amid criticism over cuts to health care and food assistance for low-income Americans.
Trump’s bill promises multitrillion-dollar tax cuts while simultaneously rolling back programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Congressional Budget Office also estimates this bill could add an additional $3.8 trillion to the national debt. 
Democrats and advocates held a news conference Thursday urging Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst to vote against the bill.
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks has received criticism for her vote. Derek Eadon, former Iowa Democratic Party Chair, said in a press release it threatens clean energy jobs in Iowa’s 1st District by repealing the clean energy credits of 2022, despite past commitment to protect these tax credits. Miller-Meeks is currently a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee which helped to identify budget cuts in the programs it oversees, including Medicare and Medicaid.

Miller-Meeks posted in a statement: “This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable—not for those who can work and choose not to.” Miller-Meeks said. “Today’s vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility, and a government that serves its people, not the other way around.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson also voted for the bill, saying on X: “Iowans overwhelmingly voted for President Trump’s America First agenda — ending illegal immigration and preventing dangerous criminals and drugs from entering our communities, cutting wasteful spending, and unleashing American energy.”
Reps. Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra, members of the Agriculture committee, played a role in identifying $230 billion in cuts, which included major cuts to the food program SNAP. 
“The bill also safeguards key benefit programs for vulnerable Iowans while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” Nunn said in a statement. “It bolsters border security, restores accountability, and invests in American energy dominance—where Iowa is already leading the charge.”
Feenstra stated: “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our families will see big tax cuts, Iowa workers will have higher wages, our farmers will see relief from the death tax, and our small businesses and local manufacturers will grow and thrive.”
Grassley, Klobuchar introduce bipartisan resolution for return of Ukrainian children
Grassley and Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced a bipartisan resolution calling for the return of all abducted Ukrainian children before Russia-Ukraine peace agreements are finalized. Ernst was also a co-sponsor of this bill.
“[Putin] has kidnapped thousands of children to brainwash and Russify them in an attempt to destroy their cultural identity and heritage,” Grassley said, “The United States ought to demand these children are returned before inking a deal to end the war in Ukraine.”
Trump said he believed his phone call Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin went “very well.” Following the call, he dropped his demands for an immediate ceasefire. The Kremlin has yet to provide a timeframe for ceasefire negotiations. 
This resolution, while non-binding, condemns Russia’s “abduction and forcible transfer of Ukrainian children,” a prominent war crime allegation against Russia. Its introduction follows a letter sent in April by 40 prominent religious leaders to Trump and Secretary of state Marco Rubio calling for Russia to return an estimated 20,000 children forcibly transferred to Russian territory.
Grassley and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, also introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers from Age Discrimination Act, which seeks to “level the playing field for Older Workers,” according to a news release. This bill would recognize the legitimacy of “mixed-motive” claims and reaffirm the workers’ ability to use any type of admissible evidence to prove their claims. 
Miller-Meeks’ veteran suicide prevention bill passes through House
The No Wrong Door for Veterans Act, introduced by Miller-Meeks, passed through the House this week. This bill seeks to strengthen the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention grant program by requiring local Veterans Affairs coordination and clearer eligibility standards, expanding access to emergency care, and holding grantees accountable. 
“The No Wrong Door for Veterans Act ensures that our heroes are never turned away or left without help. It streamlines access, strengthens coordination, and reaffirms our promise to those who served. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort—and to say to every veteran: we see you, we hear you, and we will fight for you,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement.
Additionally, this bill included the Supporting Prosthetics and Recreational Therapy act. The SPORT act ensures that artificial limbs must be furnished to eligible veterans as medical services, which include prostheses and terminal devices for sports and recreational activities.
Hinson named co-chair of biofuels caucus
Hinson was announced Thursday as a co-chair for the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, alongside five other representatives. Hinson said she plans to use the position as a means of expanding access to Iowa biofuels, increasing blending targets and securing permission to allow the sale of E15 year-round.
Currently, E15, a fuel blend consisting of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for the most part is not sold during summer months because it has a higher fuel volatility than allowed under the Clean Air Act. 
Hinson said in a news release she wishes to increase domestic energy production stating “biofuels are key to Iowa’s economy and key to American energy dominance.”
Nunn, Himes introduce FORCE act to “modernize” Defense Production Act
Nunn and Democrat Jim Himes of Connecticut’s 4th District introduced the Federal Overhaul of Reserve Command Executive Modernization Act. The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950, grants the president power to expand and expedite the supply of materials and services from the domestic industrial base. 
The FORCE act seeks to reintroduce the National Defense Executive Reserve, which would bring private-sector industry leaders and trained civilian experts into a corps for guidance during national emergencies. This bill would also allow federal agencies to partner with private industry more efficiently. The National Defense Executive Reserve was first established in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower through an executive order. 
“In today’s threat environment, America can’t afford a playbook from the 1950’s,” Nunn said. “Let’s leverage America’s best and brightest in the private and public sectors.”

Scaling back Sawtooth National Forest Service office hours could have widespread effects in Idaho – a state where more than 60% of the land is public land and recreation use and activities is at historic high levels.
“The bottom line is that the current administration’s efforts to save money and increase efficiencies has led to serious inefficiencies on the ground,” John Robison, public lands and wildlife director for the Idaho Conservation League, said Friday. “The administration’s understaffing the SNRA to the point they will only be open three days a week is a significant disservice for all of us who love the SNRA.”
In a Friday’s press release, Forest Service officials said visitors who need help when the offices are closed will have to call and leave a message. 
“Stakeholders requiring assistance from these offices outside of the listed hours should call and leave phone messages at the office from which they require services,” Forest Service officials said in Friday’s press release. “Forest staff in these offices will follow-up on all calls and messages at their earliest convenience.” 
Acting Sawtooth National Forest Supervisor Shawn Robnett said the staff members the agency does have are trying to find the best way to do their jobs.
“Adjusting our office hours as we enter our busiest season allows our rangers some flexibility with their available staff to continue to carry out all aspects of our mission – caring for the land while serving people,” Robnett said in a written statement. “Ensuring our employees are still out in the field accomplishing their work also affords our employees the opportunity to meet stakeholders where they are – out on the forest.” 
Efforts to reach a Sawtooth National Forest public affairs officer for follow up information were unsuccessful Friday.
The following field office hours are in place effective immediately. 

Fairfield Ranger District: Open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays and Fridays.
Minidoka Ranger District: Open 8 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays.
Sawtooth National Recreation Area offices in Ketchum and Stanley: Temporarily closed until June 16. Both offices are scheduled to reopen three days a week from June 16 to Labor Day.

Once the office hours for reopening the Stanley and Ketchum field offices are available, they will be posted online, officials said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Every New Mexican deserves access to healthcare, dignity, and the peace of mind that comes from knowing their family will be cared for. But right now, that basic promise is under attack.

As a mom, an attorney, and a healthcare advocate, I work alongside families across New Mexico, in rural towns, Tribal communities, and urban neighborhoods, who rely on Medicaid as a lifeline. For far too many, it’s the only path to a doctor’s visit, a mental health appointment, or life-saving treatment.

Now, Congress is considering a budget that would gut Medicaid and slash funding for the programs our communities rely on every single day. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” – recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives – would create deep, drastic, devastating cuts to Medicaid, harming seniors, people with disabilities, and children. It even proposes new burdensome “work requirements,” an old, failed policy that would create needless bureaucracy and strip people of care, not because they don’t work, but because they can’t keep up with confusing paperwork.

Let’s be clear about what this means in New Mexico:

Nearly 850,000 people, including almost 70% of our children, rely on Medicaid.

It covers cancer screenings, prenatal visits, prescriptions, and behavioral health — care that keeps families whole.

In rural and Tribal communities, it’s the backbone of our healthcare system, funding clinics, keeping hospitals open, and making sure providers can serve everyone who walks through the door.

If this budget passes, all of that is at risk. We’ve already seen more than 100,000 New Mexicans pushed off Medicaid in the past year. Many are still eligible, but are lost in the red tape of the “unwinding.” These new proposals would make things even worse.

It would mean newborns missing out on critical early checkups, parents being forced to choose between groceries and insulin, and people suffering and dying from preventable conditions.

And for what? To give more tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.

Let’s talk about these “work requirements.” Most people who can work, already do, especially in low-wage, seasonal, or caregiving roles. And those who aren’t working often face real barriers: disability, caregiving, lack of transportation, unstable housing. Studies show that about half of people subjected to these requirements lose coverage, not because they’re unwilling to work, but due to the paperwork burdens and red tape.

This isn’t about encouraging work. It’s about terminating people’s healthcare.

Together, we must reject this reckless and harmful legislation that would strip healthcare from millions of Americans, and our stories are the most powerful defense. We must speak up loudly and boldly to send a strong message: No one can afford to lose their healthcare coverage.

Have you or your family benefited from Medicaid? Now is the time to tell your story to protect it. Telling your story can stop harmful cuts before they become law, show what’s really at stake, and protect care for millions of families like yours.

Let’s protect Medicaid and protect each other. Let’s not just defend what we have, but demand more: a healthcare system that truly works for all of us.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Grant Vander Vorst is at the epicenter of vaccine hesitancy in South Dakota: Just 56% of incoming kindergartners in Faulk County, where he lives, were up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccination during the 2023-24 school year, which was the lowest rate of any county in the state with available data.
Vander Vorst is the superintendent of Faulkton Area Schools. He said some parents are skeptical about the safety of administering multiple childhood vaccinations in a short window of time, “and justifiably so.” 
“I question it myself, and a lot of others do as well,” he said.
Vander Vorst said his views are influenced by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic whose statements about vaccines have been called false and misleading by medical professionals.
“I haven’t looked into the research, but he obviously has,” Vander Vorst said.
Faulk County is not alone. Across South Dakota, vaccine hesitancy that took hold during the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded beyond skepticism of new vaccines to doubts about long-established ones, said Erin Tobin, a nurse practitioner and Republican former state senator from Winner.
Tobin said a growing number of parents are trusting web posts and social media influencers over local health care professionals. 
“It used to be that I could start a discussion with a patient with the words ‘the CDC recommends,’” Tobin said, referencing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “and now I’m cautious to use that because people don’t trust the CDC.”

During the 2018-19 school year, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 96% of kindergarteners in South Dakota received all their required vaccinations. That number fell to 91% during the 2023-24 school year, the most recent year of available statewide data. 
Public health advocates are sounding the alarm about declining vaccination rates as the United States experiences its most severe measles outbreak since 2000, with over 1,000 confirmed cases across 31 states, including 12 confirmed cases in North Dakota. South Dakota has not had a confirmed case of measles so far this year, but last July, it reported its first measles case in nine years.
According to the CDC, a measles vaccination rate of 95% is needed to achieve herd immunity and prevent outbreaks, given the highly contagious nature of the virus. 
Ten years ago, only six South Dakota counties had MMR rates below 95%, with the lowest being 80%. Now, more than 40 counties in the state are below 95%, with 12 below 80% and five below 70%. The rates could be even lower than the numbers indicate, because kindergarten-age students being homeschooled or attending other forms of alternative instruction are not required to report their vaccination status. There were 431 alternative-instruction kindergarten students statewide last fall.
The MMR vaccine is a key indicator for public health, said Dr. Amy Winter, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. When MMR vaccination rates fall, it signals broader vulnerabilities.
“Where there is measles, there could be other outbreaks, other infectious diseases, depending on the dearth of vaccination that may be happening,” Winter said.
Mark Sternhagen, a retiree who formerly taught at South Dakota State University, knows those risks well. He was born soon after the polio vaccine came out in 1955. He contracted polio before his parents were able to get him vaccinated, and has used a wheelchair ever since.
“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that if I got the vaccine, I would not have gotten polio,” he said. “I look at these declining rates and it just makes me sick.” 
Sternhagen said his mother carried guilt, but he doesn’t blame her. He said vaccinations in South Dakota were less accessible, and parents were less informed, but modern parents who do have access to vaccines and valid information don’t have those excuses.
“You’re putting your children and others’ children at risk, and there is no question about that,” he said.
Requirements and religion
The first laws requiring immunization appeared in the 1800s, coinciding with the development and spread of a smallpox vaccine. In 1922, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a local government’s vaccination mandate as a prerequisite to attending public school, leading states to implement similar requirements. 
States began allowing religious exemptions in the mid-20th century following advocacy from religious minorities, like the Christian Scientists. Adherents generally rely on prayer over medical care, and often decline to vaccinate children, according to the Harvard Divinity School.  
South Dakota’s immunization law requires children entering school or early childhood programs to be immunized against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, rubeola, rubella, mumps, tetanus, meningitis and varicella.
There are two exemptions in South Dakota’s law. One is a medical exemption for children with certification from a licensed physician that immunization would threaten their life or health. Those exemptions have remained steady over the past decade at 0.2% of kindergartners or less.
There’s also a religious exemption, requiring a written statement from a parent or guardian that the child is an adherent of a religious doctrine whose teachings are opposed to immunization.
Religious exemptions are growing in South Dakota, where 5.4% of kindergarteners had them last school year, compared to 1.5% a decade ago. In raw numbers, that’s a change from 181 kindergarteners to 636.
Tobin, the nurse practitioner and former legislator, said the claiming of a religious exemption is probably not religiously motivated in many cases.
“I do think they’re using that as this all-encompassing exemption, and so it’s probably something they just don’t believe in, but not necessarily something that is against the religion,” she said.


One factor contributing to South Dakota’s declining vaccination trend is falling rates among Hutterite people, members of a communal branch of the Anabaptist faith who have dozens of agricultural-based colonies in the state.
During the 2019-20 school year, six of the approximately 50 Hutterite colony elementary schools in the state reported vaccination rates of 0%. Thirty-two of them did so during the 2023-24 school year. 
There are questions about the validity of the data. A state Department of Health dashboard shows some Hutterite colony schools with 0% of their kindergarten students vaccinated, but also shows some of those same schools with less than 100% of the students claiming a religious or medical exemption. South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Health and the Department of Education to explain the discrepancy but did not receive a full explanation from either department.
Searchlight followed-up by asking the departments what the state is doing to address the discrepancies.
“If any students are identified as neither vaccinated nor exempted (medical or religious), the accreditation team identifies that as a ‘finding, which requires the school district to resolve the deficit,” Department of Education spokeswoman Nancy Van Der Weide said in written statement. “If the school takes action to correct the situation within the allotted timeframe, the district receives accreditation. If they fail to do so, the school may be placed on probation or ultimately suspended.”






As of Friday, Van Der Weide had not identified which schools, if any, are currently on probation or facing suspension over vaccination exemption issues.






Upland Colony Elementary near Letcher, within the Sanborn Central School District, is one such school where the data does not add up. Laura Licht is an administrative assistant with the district. She said students at the colony have filed exemptions, and the data may not be getting pulled properly by the state.
Vander Vorst said his school district of 36 kindergarteners includes three Hutterite colony schools in its borders, and he said that likely contributes to the county’s low vaccination rate. The numbers show that Faulkton Area School’s kindergarten vaccination rate for required immunizations was 77% last year, while the rates for the three colony schools in the district ranged from zero to 50%.
Josh Oltmanns, CEO and elementary principal of Hanson School District, echoed that. The vaccination rate among kindergarteners at Hanson Elementary last year was 94%. The rates at the district’s colony schools were as low as 50%.
“I’d bet, if you look, a lot of these lower school districts have colonies,” Oltmanns said. “And that’s within those peoples’ rights.” 
It’s unclear why Hutterite people would be less supportive of vaccinations now than previously.
South Dakota Searchlight made multiple calls to Hutterite colonies and to educators who serve Hutterite students, but most were unwilling to speak about the potential reasons for vaccine hesitancy. An academic who studies the Hutterite faith said he doesn’t know why vaccination rates at colonies would be falling.
At one colony, a member who declined to provide her name said hesitancy is driven by the number of vaccines now being given to children.
“They’ve added so many more,” she said. “It’s a risk we don’t want to take.” 
Answering concerns
Medical professionals say those fears are unfounded.
The CDC says vaccines contain weakened or killed versions of germs that cause a disease. These elements of vaccines, and other molecules and micro-organisms that stimulate the immune system, are called “antigens.”
Dr. Allie Alvine, founder of South Dakota Families for Vaccines, said children encounter more antigen exposure during “one play session in a sandbox” than during an entire vaccine schedule.
“And the ones we expose a child to via vaccination are proven to be good for them,” Alvine said. “What we expose them to is targeted and saves lives.” 
Dr. Ashley Sands, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases with Sanford Health, said parents are more frequently asking questions about the efficacy of vaccinations. She finds herself debunking some of Kennedy’s claims, like rumored links between vaccines and autism. 
The claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism originated from a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which was discredited due to serious methodological flaws, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Multiple large-scale studies since then have found no credible evidence supporting the claim. Wakefield lost his medical license, and his paper was retracted.
“The medical community can read the research it conducts,” Sands said. “Is it not far more likely Kennedy, who has never done medical research nor formally studied medicine, is misinterpreting or misrepresenting the data?” 
Sands emphasized that vaccination recommendations are built on decades of peer-reviewed and replicated research.
“A good doctor is keeping up with the medical journals pertinent to their field and adjusting patient recommendations as our shared science evolves,” Sands said. “Meanwhile, Kennedy is using his position to push conspiracies.”
Sands also hears parents romanticize “natural immunity” over vaccination. She warns that natural infection with diseases like measles can be deadly. Plus, infants and immunocompromised people rely on those around them to be immune, blocking the disease’s spread. If enough people are vaccinated, the disease can’t reach those most at risk.
“A child with cancer should have the freedom to go to school without being exposed to illnesses that are easily preventable,” Sands said.
Vaccinations and Pierre politics
Alvine said vaccine misinformation has taken hold in South Dakota politics. She cited recent failed legislation targeting vaccines, including bills promoting “conscience exemptions” to vaccination mandates and separating blood donations based on COVID-19 vaccination status — all based on misinformation, Alvine said.
“They prey on parents’ fears,” Alvine said. “Once you instill fear, it’s hard to fix that.”
Republican House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach of Spearfish voted for the conscience exemptions bill. He said “the ‘trust the science’ phase of COVID” is why people are more vaccine hesitant.

“I think wisdom is needed to make the distinction between true public health emergencies and those situations, more often, where personal bodily autonomy has to remain inviolate,” Odenbach said.
Alvine said she’s trying to educate people to accept vaccines, not force them against their will.
“Anytime we can save a child’s life, to grow up and live, it’s worth it,” she said. “It’s not, ‘Most kids will get through it and be fine.’ They will be miserable. A portion will get lifelong, deadly diseases stemming from measles, and some will even die.”
Nearly every child in the U.S. caught measles before the vaccine became available in 1963. In 2000, health officials declared measles eliminated in the U.S. thanks to nearly universal vaccination.
The South Dakota Department of Health declined an interview for this story but provided a statement noting the downward trend in childhood vaccinations is concerning. The department highlighted ongoing marketing efforts, refreshed ad campaigns, and 1,700 more total immunizations – combined among children and adults – administered in 2024 than 2023.
“We can have a positive impact on all health outcomes, including childhood vaccination rates, by addressing access to care, social drivers of health care outcomes, and public awareness campaigns,” the department said.
President Donald Trump’s federal spending cuts have included $1.7 million in reduced or eliminated grants to the department, including $83,500 labeled as being for immunizations and vaccines for children.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EM8A2103-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

Photo via InstagramBURLINGTON — Legal troubles for a former California biomedical researcher and entrepreneur didn’t end when he was convicted by a jury last month of ordering the death of a former business partner.During a hearing on Friday, federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford lifted a stay in a civil wrongful death lawsuit also brought against Serhat Gumrukcu for his role in the 2018 death of Gregory Davis of Danville.That civil case had been paused pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding against Gumrukcu.In April, a jury in the criminal case convicted Gumrukcu of murder for hire and conspiracy to commit fraud. Prosecutors claimed that a failed business deal between Gumrukcu and Davis motivated Gumrukcu to hire someone to the Vermont man. According to prosecutors, Gumrukcu ordered and financed Davis’ fatal hit because he was concerned the Vermont man was going to go to authorities and accuse him of fraud. That would, prosecutors argued during the trial, put in jeopardy an even larger business deal Gumrukcu had been involved in at that time with Enochian Biosciences, in which he stood to gain millions. READ MORE
Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow, brought the civil suit against Gumrukcu in June 2022 shortly after he was arrested.Paul Perkins, an attorney for Melissa Davis and the estate of her late husband, told Crawford during a hearing Friday that he intended to file a motion seeking summary judgment on the wrongful death claim because Gumrukcu had already been found responsible in criminal court for Davis’ death.A jury would then determine whether Gumrukcu would pay damages, Perkins said.Shortly after the civil lawsuit was filed, Crawford granted Melissa Davis an order seizing roughly 12.5 million shares of stock Gumrukcu had in Enochian Biosciences — a California biotechnology company in which he had an ownership stake. At the time that order was granted, each share was valued around $2, meaning there was around $25 million worth of shares. However, during Friday’s hearing, Perkins told the judge that the share prices have since plunged to a total value of around $4 million, or a little more than 30 cents per share.Crawford questioned whether there would even be someone interested in purchasing those shares.“That’s a substantial concern,” Perkins said, adding he didn’t think there would be much of a market for them.During the hearing, Perkins said he may also seek Gumrukcu’s other assets, including shares in various business entities as well as a multimillion dollar California home he had been living in at the time of his arrest with his husband.Crawford asked Perkins to draft a settlement offer for Gumrukcu to potentially head off further litigation.  Meanwhile, Lisa Shelkrot, an attorney who had been representing Gumrukcu in the civil case, filed a motion to withdraw herself from it. She told Crawford during Friday’s hearing that Gumrukcu wanted to represent himself in the matter. Crawford said he would not immediately grant Shelkrot’s request. Instead, the judge said, he wanted her to relay to Gumrukcu any possible settlement offer first.Gumrukcu, who is currently incarcerated awaiting sentencing in the criminal case, did not attend Friday’s civil case hearing due to difficulties with obtaining transportation and video conferencing for people in custody, according to Crawford.A sentencing date in the criminal case has not yet been set. Gumrukcu, 42, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Three other men charged in connection with the murder-for-hire plot reached plea deals in the case and testified against Gumrukcu during the criminal trial, including the hit man who carried out the fatal shooting in Vermont. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wrongful death case advances against scientist convicted in murder-for-hire of Vermont man.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Serhat-Gumrukcu.png,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(provided by USC)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s traditional K-12 public schools will receive a bigger share of new money in the coming school year under a compromise approved this week.
An adjustment in calculations ultimately shifted nearly $10 million of a $112 million sum from charter schools to traditional public schools, according to data provided by the state Department of Education. That’s part of roughly $4.5 billion total the budget sends to K-12 public schools.
Also included in the $14.7 billion spending plan advanced Wednesday is more than $500 million to fund projects at the state’s public colleges, plus a continued guarantee that tuition rates will remain frozen for in-state students.
Parts of the budget were locked in when legislators started negotiations. That includes a $1,500 increase in teachers’ minimum pay, which will bring the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500. With an unexpected $1 billion increase in revenue coming as legislators started publicly negotiating, much of the disagreement between the chambers’ proposed budgets then came down to directives on how to spend the money.
Legislators are scheduled to return for a final vote approving the budget Wednesday.
Virtual charter school funding
Both chambers’ plans put an additional $112 million into “state aid to classrooms,” which is primarily meant for teacher raises. So, that statewide total was set ahead of negotiations. Where the plans differed was in the funding formula for virtual charter schools. The House plan lowered the normal weighting for students in online classrooms.
Traditional public schools, brick-and-mortar charter schools and virtual charter schools are all funded differently, with calculations involving student populations.
Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools organized under a statewide school district don’t receive local property taxes. So, state funding formulas provide them a higher proportion of state aid per student to help make up for that. Virtual charter schools receive a lesser share that other charter schools.
That is nothing new. But a combination of a growth in charter schools, population decreasing in some traditional schools, and a smaller hike in state aid being put through the complicated calculations meant traditional schools were slated to get less than they expected.
Last year, the Legislature provided an additional $200 million in “state aid to classrooms” to boost minimum salaries by $2,500. Charter schools received 24% of that money.
If the formulas had stayed the same, charter schools would’ve received more than 45% of the additional $112 million in the coming school year, according to numbers provided by the House Ways and Means Committee. Yet, the schools governed autonomously — while growing in population — are still expected to enroll just 7.5% of South Carolina’s K-12 public school students.
Advocates for the state’s 72 traditional school districts worried the lopsided distribution could only get worse in the future.
“If it keeps going the way it’s going, it’s going to be very difficult to address this thing unless we do it now,” said Debbie Elmore, a lobbyist for the state School Boards Association.
SC legislators advance $14.7B spending plan that includes pay raise for themselves

The issue became contentious enough that legislators stepped into a back room to continue deliberating after reaching a consensus on the rest of the budget Wednesday. Ultimately, the chambers compromised on a funding weight that split the difference between their spending plans.
Split among 72 school districts, all of which receive a different amount of the funding under the calculations that also involve their tax base — what’s called the “index of taxpaying ability” — that $10 million won’t make a huge difference. But it will make a difference, Elmore said.
Charter schools said they needed the extra money to support a growing number of students enrolled in their programs.
“While this recent funding decision is disappointing, South Carolina’s Legislature has historically upheld the principle that families deserve the right to choose the educational option that best serves their children,” the Charter Institute at Erskine, the authorizer for 26 charter schools statewide, said in a statement. “That principle — and the rapidly growing demand for school choice — must continue to drive the educational funding decisions made in our state.”
House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister said it was a shame that instead of getting together to figure out the best way to distribute new money for students, groups on either side of the issue attacked each other using faulty numbers.
“I’m frustrated by the whole prospect that while we’re trying to take care of students there are groups out there that are misleading the people who care about their kids and funding in their schools,” the Greenville Republican said.
The change in funding weights is meant to be a one-year fix, Bannister said.
Also included in the budget is a directive for the state’s Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office to take a closer look at the funding formula and find a way to distribute state money that helps traditional and charter schools proportionally.
“Education funding conversations are complex and must support thoughtful decision-making with accurate information,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “I’m grateful for the General Assembly’s strong focus on K-12 education in this budget and appreciate them providing a pathway for the deliberative, fact-driven study of funding allocations that our students deserve.”
“We must never lose sight of our shared commitment: ensuring the opportunity of an exceptional education for every South Carolina child, wherever they learn,” Weaver continued.
Higher education
Also at question when legislators sat down to hash out differences in the chambers’ plans was whether to continue a requirement that all public colleges freeze tuition for in-state students for a seventh year.
College presidents said freezing tuition long-term wasn’t sustainable, so the House proposed allowing universities to raise costs for incoming freshmen, so long as their tuition remained the same for each class through graduation.
Gov. Henry McMaster’s office said the governor was opposed to any increase. Facing the potential of a veto, representatives agreed with the Senate’s plan to keep tuition rates as they are but allow colleges to raise other fees, including the price of athletics.
SC colleges have frozen tuition for several years. University presidents say that’s not sustainable.

Included in the budget deal was $65 million to offset costs for colleges to maintain tuition for South Carolina residents. That’s a fraction of the $130 million schools said they would need to fully cover the costs.
The state’s colleges are also set to collectively receive more than $500 million to renovate existing buildings, build new facilities and establish new programs.
The University of South Carolina had the biggest single project, with $150 million to build a specialized hospital for neurological diseases in Columbia. The hospital, which is expected to cost $350 million overall, will have 80 beds for critical care and 32 beds for rehabilitation, according to an agency budget request.
This was “truly a banner year” for funding at USC, university spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
Clemson University is slated to receive $40 million to build a NextGen Computing Complex, a facility to expand the university’s electrical and computing engineering programs. The Medical University of South Carolina is set to get $25 million for a new seven-story building in Charleston to house its College of Medicine.
“We thank Senate and House leadership and the entire General Assembly for their continued investment in Clemson and higher education in South Carolina,” Clemson spokesman Joe Galbraith said in a statement. “Their support helps our continued commitment to access and affordability to a world-class education for every South Carolina citizen.”
Other projects slated to receive more than $10 million include:

$16 million to Greenville Technical College to build a Center for Industrial Cyber Security and AI,
$16 million to Midlands Technical College for an advanced trades center,
$15 million to South Carolina State University to renovate a historic building to house its College of Agriculture, Family and Consumer Sciences,
$15 million to Central Carolina Technical College for a technical high school workforce center,

Three Jefferson County residents are suing the county attorney over an alleged warrantless search of their property.
The plaintiffs — Gail Osborn, Tim McConnell Seaba and Gordon Seaba – are suing Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding, Jefferson County, and Iowa Department of Health and Human Services employee Kelsey Koenig in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for alleged trespassing, invasion of privacy and civil rights violations related to unreasonable searches.
According to the lawsuit, the three plaintiffs live on the same parcel of land in Jefferson County, with Gordon Seaba living in the main house on the property while Timothy McConnell Seaba and Osborn live in a separate home at the back of the property.
They allege that on Nov. 15, 2024, DHHS received an anonymous complaint alleging that Osborn had given birth to a girl two months prior and was using methamphetamine while caring for the child.
“The information relayed by the anonymous complainant was entirely false,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Osborn was never pregnant in 2024, had not given birth to a child, and was not using methamphetamine while caring for a child.
Koenig, a DHHS child protective services worker, spoke with Osborn at her house regarding the complaint and allegedly observed that Osborn exhibited no physical indications of having been recently pregnant. Osborn allegedly allowed Koenig to inspect her home, which showed no evidence of a baby residing there. Osborn then accompanied Koenig to the main home, where Gordon Seaba allegedly agreed to an inspection that produced no evidence of a baby or any illegal substances.
Later that morning, Koenig allegedly spoke to a Washington County Sheriff’s Office investigator who indicated he knew Osborn and had not observed any signs of her being pregnant the previous summer. A friend of Osborn’s allegedly gave similar information to Koenig.
The lawsuit claims that later that day, Moulding and Koenig arrived at the plaintiffs’ property, accompanied by Assistant Jefferson County Attorney Elizabeth Estey, two Jefferson County deputies and two Washington County deputies. The officials had no warrant to search any part of the property and Timothy McConnell Seaba informed them that no one was allowed on his property without a warrant, the lawsuit alleges.
“Moulding ignored Timothy McConnell Seaba and continued up the driveway to the main house,” the lawsuit claims. “Moulding opened the door to the main house and entered Gordon Seaba’s home without asking for or receiving consent.”
The lawsuit claims Moulding and Koenig then proceeded to search Gordon Seaba’s home, after which the law enforcement officers also entered the property to search outbuildings and campers on the site. Moulding then searched Osborn’s home over her objections, the lawsuit claims.
“No evidence that a baby had ever existed was found on the property,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Koenig subsequently deemed the anonymous complaint to be “unfounded” due to the lack of evidence the reported child existed.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Moulding said Friday he had yet to see a copy of the plaintiff’s lawsuit.
“This was obviously a government operation that was pursuant to a valid purpose,” Moulding said. “But beyond that, without having reviewed the actual complaint, I think I should withhold comment.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

Jenny Willford after a ride-sharing safety bill passed the Colorado Senate during the last day of the 2025 legislative session on May 7, 2025 at the Colorado Capitol. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill on Friday afternoon that would have required more safety features in ride-hailing services, writing that the legislation would risk the future of companies like Uber and Lyft in the state.
The bill would “would jeopardize these services in Colorado to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers. This in turn would create economic hardship for the thousands of people who rely on the platforms for income and to go to medical appointments, as well as potentially add more drunk drivers to the road,” he wrote in his veto letter.
House Bill 25-1291 aimed to increase safety for passengers, including optional audio and visual recording during rides and a ban on drivers offering their passengers food and drink. It would have also added some new background check requirements and allowed a person to sue, instead of going to arbitration, a company or driver in the case of death, sexual assault, personal injury or kidnapping.
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat who said she was sexually assaulted by a Lyft driver last year. Prosecutors charged the man who allegedly attacked her earlier this month. Willford is also suing Lyft over the incident. She did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the veto.
Lawmakers narrowed the scope of the bill throughout the legislative process, most significantly in the final days of the session, to respond to concerns from ride-hailing companies. It passed the House on a 56-9 vote and the Senate on a 22-13 vote.
Still, Uber said they would leave the state if the bill became law, and Uber and Lyft both encouraged a veto after the legislative session wrapped up.
Polis wrote that he was concerned the audio and visual recording provisions were in conflict with state privacy laws, and that banning arbitration clauses in rider agreements on the platforms in question could be preempted by federal law.
“I fear victims attempting to bring a claim in court in reliance of this bill will have their claims dismissed based on federal law and the arbitration clauses in the user terms and agreements, causing substantial delay in victims achieving relief,” he wrote. 
At the same time, Polis directed the state’s Department of Regulatory Agencies to work with bill sponsors to come up with policy ideas that could be implemented through executive orders or legislation next year. Specifically, he wants the department and the Public Utilities Commission to strengthen rules against driver impersonation and enhance existing audits on the companies’ background check processes.
He also requested recommendations about how to update and potentially expand the regulatory structure for ride-hailing companies “with a specific focus on passenger safety and enhanced transparency.”
“HB 25-1291 should not represent the end of this conversation on ride share safety,” he wrote.

Reeves will call special session next week to pass state budget,Taylor Vance and Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/23/gov-reeves-will-call-special-session-next-week-to-pass-state-budget/,Lawmakers failed to pass a budget earlier this year in regular session.,"Gov. Tate Reeves announced on Friday that he intends to call a special legislative session next week for lawmakers to pass a state budget.
The move comes after House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, both Republicans, said separately that they had reached a handshake deal on a $7 billion state budget, which was supposed to have been passed earlier this year in regular session.
Reeves, a Republican, said he informed Hosemann and White on Friday that he intends to call a special session for the middle of next week.
“The proposed budget does not materially increase state spending, is fiscally conservative, and will help us to continue Mississippi’s historic economic momentum,” Reeves said in a statement posted on social media. “I’m proud of the work we’ve done to reach this agreement. I’d like to thank Mississippi’s legislative appropriators for working diligently throughout the budget negotiation process. I’m excited to get the special session completed and look forward to quickly passing the budget.”
Multiple legislators told Mississippi Today that House Speaker Jason White’s office notified them that the special session would begin on Wednesday morning, though the governor has not yet publicly said when it will begin. 
Mississippi lawmakers must return for a special session because they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget. Lawmakers were mired in political infighting over tax reform and capital projects, including many lawmakers’ pet projects in their districts.
The Senate wanted to spend only on projects for state agencies, universities and colleges. The House believed there was enough money to fund projects in counties and municipalities around the state, in addition to the state projects.
The political reality is that legislative leadership tightly controls the bulk of the local projects in what’s often referred to as the “Christmas Tree bill.” Leadership can use these projects to reward people who buy into their agenda and punish members who buck the leadership.

(Julia Goldberg / Source NM)New Mexico health officials on Friday reported four more measles cases in Sandoval County, bringing the statewide total to 78. The new cases also brought possible exposures in Santa Fe County, where cases have not yet been reported.
The new cases include an infant too young for vaccination and three adults who had each had at least one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a news release.
Six counties now have cases:
• 65 in Lea County
• six in Sandoval County
• three in Eddy County
• two in Doña Ana County
• one each in Curry and Chaves counties
NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Miranda Durham and DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie held a news conference Thursday in Albuquerque to issue new recommendations for children in counties with measles cases to receive a first injection earlier than standard protocol and have three, rather than two, shots overall.
Durham also noted during the news conference that travel presents “a risk for measles spread and that the current outbreak is New Mexico’s largest in many years.
Both Durham and DeBlassie continue to reference vaccines as the only fully preventative method against measles. “We want to make sure everybody stays safe,” DeBlassie said.
The new cases may have involved exposures at the following times, days and locations:

Vaccination information
Durham recommended Thursday that infants as young as six months could be eligible for a third measles vaccination dose if residing in or traveling to high measles spread areas.
Adults born after 1957 are recommended to have at least one dose of the vaccine, but two doses offers 97% protection from the measles infection and prevents spread. Measles symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people.
NMDOH is offering free measles vaccines at offices around the state, which are listed on the department’s measles webpage.
New Mexico residents can check their records online at the state Vax View website or call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773. The hotline is staffed by nurses, who can offer measles vaccine or further testing information in English and Spanish.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Though the full ramifications of the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House this week are still murky — especially since the bill is likely to change as it makes its way through the Senate — the bill as currently written could jeopardize health insurance for tens of thousands of Utahns. 
Plus, states including Utah would need to grapple with an estimated $625 billion in cumulative Medicaid cuts over 10 years from work requirements, stricter eligibility rules and a pause on provider taxes — changes that would likely lead millions of Americans losing Medicaid coverage. 
On Friday, officials from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services told Utah News Dispatch they did not have state-specific estimates available detailing the potential impacts of the still-evolving federal budget reconciliation package on Utah’s Medicaid program because it’s still a “moving target.”
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

However, according to the health policy outlet KFF, the bill could result in an estimated $381 million loss in federal Medicaid dollars for Utah. The outlet used Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates to unpack the potential state-by-state impacts of a $625 billion federal cut to Medicaid in an analysis posted last week. 
“Cuts of $625 billion will force states to make tough choices: maintain current spending on Medicaid by raising taxes or reducing spending on other programs; or cut Medicaid spending by covering fewer people, offering fewer benefits, or paying providers less,” KFF reported. 
The vast majority of the cut would come from three sources: work requirements mandating that adults who are eligible for Medicaid expansion must meet work and reporting requirements (estimated to save $300.8 billion as people become ineligible), repealing the Biden administration’s rule simplifying eligibility and renewal process (estimated to save $162.7 billion) and setting a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes (estimated to save $86.8 billion), accordion to KFF. 
It depends on what states decide to do to respond to the cuts, but in another analysis posted Tuesday based on CBO estimates, KFF estimated the changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces could increase the number of people without health insurance across the nation by 8.6 million. 
Additionally, when combined with the effect of the expected expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, the CBO expects 13.7 million more people will be uninsured in 2034, according to KFF. 
“Anticipating how states will respond to changes in Medicaid policy is a major source of uncertainty in CBO’s cost estimates. Instead of making state-by-state predictions about policy responses, CBO estimates the percentage of the affected population that lives in states with different types of policy responses,” KFF noted, adding that states may choose to implement work requirements that are easier or harder to comply with, which would impact enrollment.

So KFF’s analysis included a range of enrollment impacts varying by plus or minus 25% from a midpoint estimate. 
Based on the budget reconciliation bill’s changes to Medicaid, Utah is projected to see its uninsured population increase by a mid-range estimate of roughly 65,000 — somewhere between 49,000 on the low end and up to 81,000 on the high end, according to the analysis. 
When combined with the expected expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, KFF estimated that Utah’s uninsured population could increase by even more — roughly 150,000, or a 4% increase. That estimate could vary between 110,000 on the low end or up to 190,000 on the high end, according to KFF. 
Other states would see bigger impacts than Utah, where about 350,000 total Utahns enroll in Medicaid. About half of the 13.7 million more people who would be uninsured under both policy changes live in Florida (1.8 million), Texas, (1.6 million), California (1.5 million), New York (800,000), and Georgia (610,000). 
‘Devastating’: Health advocates blast bill’s House passage 
Utah health advocates who have been watching the budget reconciliation bill’s progress expressed deep disappointment in its passage out of the House. 
“I’ve yet to meet any Utahn who said that when they voted in November, they were looking for which candidate was most focused on kicking as many people off Medicaid,” said Stephanie Burdick, an advocate with the newly-formed Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition. 
“Yet here we are,” Burdick said. “The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could force almost 80,000 Utahns off their health insurance.”
  Stephanie Burdick, a health advocate, speaks during a news conference held at Pioneer Park in Salt Lake City on May 6, 2025 advocating against federal cuts to Medicaid. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)
The proposed federal cuts also come as Utah state officials — anticipating the Republican-controlled White House and Congress’ appetite to implement work requirements on Medicaid — are considering a waiver to impose work requirements on Utah’s adult Medicaid adult expansion population. 
About 75,000 Utahns have enrolled in Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, an estimated 7,500 (10%), would not qualify for an exemption and be subject to the work requirements. That means that if they don’t start working or submit documents showing they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period, they could lose their medical coverage. 
Between Utah’s proposed work requirements and the proposed federal Medicaid cuts, Burdick said state officials and federal politicians in D.C. are “both deadset on one thing: increasing the number of uninsured Utahns and squeezing more time and more money out of working families.” 
“How is this aligned with Utah values?” Burdick said, urging Congress to “go back to the drawing board and find ways to increase access and affordability to health care for all Americans and this is the opposite.”
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, also a member of the Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition, issued a statement saying health advocates “remain concerned about the devastating impact of the billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts on Utahns with disabilities.”
“Numerous provisions in this bill would be harmful to the disability community, including a work requirement that penalizes Medicaid beneficiaries for losing a job, and will strip health coverage from millions nation-wide, including many Utahns,” Crippes said.
He added that given the focus on people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, “we are particularly concerned with the impact on those with mental illness and substance use disorder, who make up nearly 60% of the expansion population.”  
“We see no beauty in a bill that denies healthcare to millions, shifts costs to the states and the middle class, and weakens our entire healthcare system,” he said. “So we urge our senators to support the disability community, protect Medicaid, and stop this bill from passing.”
President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have lauded the bill as needed to curb government spending, cut taxes and provide resources to execute Trump’s agenda around immigration, energy production and increased military investment. 
Democrats criticized the bill as a tax cut that would largely benefit the billionaire class and lead the U.S. to raise its debt limit by $4 trillion. 
How will Utah respond to Medicaid cuts if they pass?
Utah’s Medicaid Director Jennifer Strohecker briefed Utah lawmakers this week on the status of Utah’s Medicaid program, proposed changes including the state’s version of work requirements, and possible impacts from the budget reconciliation bill if it receives final passage. 
“Utah has the lowest Medicaid enrollment of every state, but for the 350,000 Utahns that do receive their health benefits through this program, it is a lifeline for preventive care, institutional care when it’s needed, physical health, behavioral health,” she told the state Health and Human Services Interim Committee on Wednesday. 
An estimated 1 in 10 Utahns are enrolled in Medicaid, she said. One in 6 babies are born with Medicaid as their health coverage.  
In total, Utah’s Medicaid program costs about $5.3 billion per year. More than 64% of it is funded with federal dollars, equaling $3.4 billion. About $1.7 in state dollars pay for the rest. 
‘Counterproductive and cruel’: Advocates form coalition to protect Medicaid from federal cuts

Lawmakers including Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, and Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, asked Strohecker about Utah’s proposed work requirement waiver and questioned whether it will lead to Utahns losing coverage due to administrative burdens. 
“This was not meant to be an administrative hurdle or a barrier. This was not meant to take people off of the Medicaid program,” she said of Utah’s proposal. 
While Strohecker noted the federal proposal has a “pretty big dollar figure tied to work requirements as it’s proposed, Utah’s design did not have that intent.” 
“So it is our commitment to look at what are those administrative hurdles, what are those barriers, as it’s designed today, and thoughtfully work through those with you all and with our partners at DWS,” she said, noting that Utah’s proposal is still being drafted using feedback from public comment. 
Though the original public comment period for Utah’s proposed work requirements waiver was initially scheduled to end Thursday, state officials told Utah News Dispatch they decided to extend it through June 2, with one more public hearing scheduled for Tuesday. 
“We have received a lot of helpful feedback and will consider those recommendations before submitting the request to (the federal government) within a month or two of closing the public comment period,” a Utah Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in an email.
However, Strohecker noted that Utah’s waiver and the federal mandates included in the budget reconciliation package are two different proposals. The proposed federal mandated work requirements would require Americans to “complete work requirements before you ever get Medicaid.” 
The federal proposal has the potential to risk loss of health coverage for tens of thousands more Utahns than the state’s work requirement waiver, as currently drafted. 
Additionally, if Congress approves the bill as currently drafted, it included a provision that would penalize states that expanded coverage for immigrants by reducing the federal Medicaid matching rate for the Medicaid expansion program from 90% to 80% for states that either provide health coverage or financial assistance to purchase health coverage to certain groups of immigrants. 
‘I have a hard enough time’: Utahns urge state not to impose work requirements on Medicaid

Last year, Utah started offering health insurance to noncitizen children through its State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. As of last week, 1,317 children were enrolled in that program, which has the capacity to cover up to 2,000 kids, according to the state’s website.
Strohecker said that if the federal government penalizes Utah for its CHIP program and reduces its state match from 90% to 80%, that would trigger a law to “terminate” Utah’s adult Medicaid expansion program. She said lawmakers may need to consider what to do about that. 
That may include repealing the state’s CHIP program for 2,000 kids in order to save Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, which covers 75,000 adults. 
Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy, acknowledged the federal bill is “constantly evolving,” so state leaders will need to watch what happens, but he said “assuming this bill passes, if this provision is left in there,” lawmakers may need to repeal CHIP.
“I think it’s a really simple policy call, myself, that we need to sunset the (CHIP) program that would trigger the 10% penalty as well as our trigger law, because that would be a domino effect,” Eliason said. “This is not making a policy comment on the underlying legislation, it’s just that our hands would be tied, and it would be, I think, the greatest good for the greatest number.” 
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also acknowledged that the federal budget package is a “moving target, so who knows what it’s going to look like in the next week.” But she asked whether the Utah Legislature would need to convene in a special session to deal with fallout if the bill receives final passage before lawmakers’ next general session in January. 
Strohecker said that’s a possibility. 
“We’ve been keeping a very close eye on this legislation,” she said.

House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton issued brief statements late Friday afternoon telling their members that they do not need to plan on returning to Tallahassee next week.
“I hope to have a better idea of our scheduling moving forward in the next few days and will share another update after the Memorial Day Holiday,” Albritton wrote.
“We continue working closely with the Senate toward a final budget agreement,” added Perez in his own statement to his members. “We will ensure you have the necessary notice to make travel and scheduling arrangements when the time comes.”
The 60-day regular legislative session was scheduled to end three weeks ago, on May 2. However, the two chambers have not been able to come together on a budget, the only job that they are constitutionally required to accomplish. The dispute mainly centers on the issue of tax cuts.
The session was originally extended to June 2, but the House returned to Tallahassee for one day last week to extend until June 30 – something that the Senate has yet to do. The fiscal year ends on June 30. If lawmakers don’t pass a budget by that time it would mean a government shutdown.
The budget passed by the House in April was $113 billion, about $4.4 billion less than the Senate’s spending plan.

Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley NewsThis story by Liz Sauchelli was first published by the Valley News on May 21.SOUTH ROYALTON — For the third time in seven months, Bethel and Royalton voters rejected a $3.8 million bond to renovate the White River Unified School District’s middle and high schools.The result was 540 to 446, according to results provided by Karmen Bascom, the Royalton town clerk who also serves as clerk for the White River Unified School District. Turnout on Tuesday was higher than it was for the same ballot measure in March, with about 27% of the district’s 3,658 voters participating.Tuesday’s rejection follows failed results for the bond at Town Meeting in March and in November.“It really is painful that this is the way it ended up,” said Nancy Pejouhy, chair of the White River Unified School District school board. “To have the vote be such a large margin was surprising, considering we were so close on the other two votes.”This week’s vote came after residents petitioned for a vote for reconsideration, so the measure had to be the same as the proposal put forward in March.The margin the renovation proposal has lost by has increased with each vote.In November, the bond failed by just 10 votes — 753-743.On Town Meeting Day, it failed by 20 votes, 435-415.The largest part of the $6.2 million project called for building a performing arts center at the high school, at a cost of about $3.17 million.Other elements included expanding the White River Valley High School’s wood shop and welding areas in South Royalton, as well as installing secure entrances at the middle school in Bethel and at the high school.In addition to the bond, the project would have been funded by capital reserve funds and donations, including $500,000 from the Jack and Dorothy Byrne Foundation.READ MORE
The school district had until the end of 2025 to use that donation, White River Valley Supervisory Union Superintendent Jamie Kinnarney said.“Certainly at this point, I think our constituents have indicated that they’re not in a position to approve a bond that’s going to result in any kind of tax increase,” he said Wednesday.Still, he noted that he expected that tuition from outside the district would have more than offset the cost of the bond.The average value of a home in the White River Unified District is just shy of $200,000, and the bond would have raised property taxes less than $50 per year, according to information provided by the school district. That amounts to roughly $1 per week, Pejouhy said, questioning why that would have felt unaffordable to residents.“You can’t even buy a pack of gum for a dollar anymore,” she said.The board decided in April to move forward with a state-mandated stormwater mitigation project near White River Valley High School’s gym. The cost of about $300,000 is expected to come from the district’s capital reserve fund. While the project was included in the bond proposal, the school board decided to do the work whether or not the bond passed.Plans are being drawn up for the work that needs to be done. The project will take place either in fall 2025 or spring 2026, Kinnarney said. The future of any other school building improvements are unclear.“We have not as a board discussed what we’re going to do beyond that,” Pejouhy said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bethel and Royalton voters again reject $3.8 million school bond.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bethel-Royalton-School-Board-Bond-Vote.jpg,,,2025-05-23 18:06:17.493994

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers passed two bills this week that aim to support mothers in the state.

One bill requires employers to give paid time off to employees who pump breastmilk at work. The second allows midwives to help with home births, which is the latest attempt by Illinois lawmakers to restore access to maternal health care in the state’s maternity care deserts.

House Bill 2688, sponsored by Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, would allow certified nurse midwives to enter a written agreement with a physician to provide or assist with home births. In designated maternity care deserts, they can enter into such an agreement even if the local physicians don’t provide home births.

The bill only applies to certified nurse midwives, who must be a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, or APRN, and have at least a graduate degree in midwifery. It does not give the same privileges to certified midwives, who are required to have a graduate degree in midwifery.

In recent years, the number of home births across the nation has been steadily rising. The CDC reported that 51,642 home births took place across the country in 2021. That number was a 12% increase from the number of home births in 2020, which the CDC said was the largest increase since at least 1990.

The rise in home births in Illinois is often attributed to the rise in the state’s maternity care deserts, which are counties without a single hospital, birth center, or licensed health care professional who offers obstetric care.

According to a report from March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on improving maternal health care across the U.S., about 34% of Illinois counties are labeled maternity care deserts. The nationwide average is about 32% of all U.S. counties.

The CDC reported that nearly 35% of women living rural areas that are of reproductive age did not live within 30 minutes of a birthing hospital in 2023.

March of Dimes reported that women living in counties with the highest travel times to a birthing hospital had to travel anywhere between 47 and 59 miles. They also found that women living in maternity care deserts had to travel a little more than 5 times as far as women living in areas of the state with adequate access to maternity care.

“This bill addresses the maternity care deserts that exist in our state to give certified nurse midwives the ability to collaborate with other nurse midwives and APRNs to provide such care,” Moeller said during a House committee hearing on the bill in March.

Illinois’ recent history around the legality of midwives also played a role in the recent increase of maternity care deserts in the state. Although midwives have been used and recognized as health care professionals for centuries, when hospitals began to be recognized as the safest health care settings in the late 1900s, many states stopped licensing midwives and even outlawed the practice altogether.

In Illinois, state officials stopped licensing midwives in the mid-1960s and outlawed the practice in 1992 – making the act a felony with punishments of fines up to $10,000 or three years in prison – according to NPR Illinois.

A law passed in 2021 reversed that decision, making midwifery in the state legal and again allowing for midwives to be legally licensed.

HB 2688 also allows nurse midwives, if they are APRNs, to provide birth services in a licensed birth center without a written agreement if the director of the birth center allows them to. Under the bill, physicians will not be liable for the acts or omissions of nurse midwives solely because of the agreement, unless the physician “has reason to believe” the midwife was unprepared to perform the services or committed willful and wanton conduct.

The bill passed the Senate on Thursday with a vote of 57-1, with only Sen. Jil Tracy, R-Quincy, voting no. It now awaits approval from the governor to become law.

Paid time off to pump breast milk
Senate Bill 212 mandates employers to compensate mothers who take breaks at work to pump breast milk for up to a year after their child is born. The bill prohibits employers from requiring employees to use paid leave time for pumping.

“I believe many employers are already doing the right thing, and, you know, we just need to compel a few of them to make sure they are also supporting mothers and babies,” Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, said on the House floor Wednesday.

During a news conference in February, bill sponsor Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, said she would have benefitted from the bill when she had children.

“I know for me, we did not have the generosity of these rules and regulations to allow me to take that break to take care of my child,” Fine said. “So, it would be hiding in a bathroom, getting away when you possibly could and actually having to stop breastfeeding early when it couldn’t work out.”

The bill passed the House Wednesday on a bipartisan vote of 82-27. It now only needs approval from the governor to become law.

As high schoolers across the state don caps and gowns for graduation, state education officials are noting the state’s highest graduation rate in at least the last 15 years. 
While still below the national average, last year the highest percentage of New Mexico high-schoolers graduated on time since 2008, when the state began its current methods of graduation rate calculations, according to new data from the Public Education Department. 
State data shows a little over three quarters of all students have graduated high school in New Mexico each year since the COVID-19 pandemic, but in 2024, 78.05% of them made it across the finish line, a slight increase over recent years and the highest rate in more than a decade.
PED calculated that of 26,108 9th graders who started the 2020 school year in New Mexico, 20,378 graduated from a New Mexico school four years later. The calculations account for students who move into or out of the state during that period, according to PED.
Despite the progress, New Mexico’s rate is about 10 percentage points less than the national average, which is 87%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
“This increase reflects the hard work of our educators, students and families, and it underscores our shared commitment to student success,” PED secretary Marianna Padilla said in a statement. “At the same time, we recognize that too many students are still not making it to the finish line—and we must continue working together to ensure every student has the support they need to graduate.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)Confirmed cases of measles in North Dakota increased to 21 this week after the Department of Health and Human Services reported two new cases in Grand Forks County, now the third county to be affected.
Both exposures in Grand Forks County are linked to international travel, according to the department. 
Williams County in western North Dakota has 13 cases and Cass County in eastern North Dakota has six confirmed cases, including one person who was hospitalized. All of the North Dakota cases involve people who were unvaccinated, the department said. 
Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said Friday she is “cautiously optimistic” about the slow spread of the disease in the state that was first confirmed May 2. But she reiterated that it takes two full incubation periods, or 42 days, without any new cases to declare an outbreak over.
“We’re definitely a long ways from that,” Howell said. 
The department is continuing to recommend early and accelerated measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations for people living in or traveling to Williams County due to confirmed community transmission. 
There is no evidence of community transmission in Cass or Grand Forks counties, the department said.
The department alerted the public to an exposure at the Williston Basin International Airport on May 14. On that day, an individual confirmed to have measles flew on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Williston. Anyone who entered the airport between 10:22 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day should consider themselves exposed to the virus, according to the department’s website.
The state health department recommends any unvaccinated people, those without at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, exposed at the airport should quarantine themselves for 21 days to see if symptoms develop to prevent exposure to the community.
Howell said state health officials were able to get the flight manifest from the affected plane and all North Dakotans on the flight were notified about their exposure to the illness.
Anyone showing symptoms should contact a health care provider before walking into a medical clinic to receive instructions on how to present themselves for testing, Howell said.
Measles symptoms can develop up to 21 days after exposure. The symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a body-wide rash.
The measles virus is spread through the air and people remain contagious for several days before and after the first symptoms appear, the department said previously.
Other North Dakota exposure sites include:

Tractor Supply Williston on May 12.
Band Day Parade Williston in Harmon Park, Main Street and 11th Street on May 10.
Essentia Health Walk-in Care Clinic on 52nd Avenue in Fargo on May 9.
Essentia Health – The Lights West Fargo Clinic on May 7.
Missouri Ridge Elementary School from April 29 to May 2.

Howell said over the next few days the quarantine period for Williston schools will expire.
“Hopefully, we won’t have any children positive from the school setting,” she said. “From what I’m hearing from local public health, people have been coming in to be vaccinated … which is great to hear.”
As of May 22, the CDC reported 1,046 measles cases have been confirmed nationwide across 30 states. About 67% of those cases involved people under age 19 and 97% of the confirmed cases involved people who were unvaccinated or had an “unknown” vaccination status.
“We don’t want there to be any more cases, so we just really want to encourage people to revisit vaccination with a trusted health care provider,” Howell said.An updated list of measles exposure sites can be found on the HHS website.

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An interview with a news outlet cost a former University of Kansas resident assistant his job and his home. Now, he’s suing the university for violating his free speech rights.
The lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday says KU restricted Anthony Alvarez’ speech and fired him without cause in retaliation.
Alvarez, who is trans, talked to a media outlet on Feb. 26 during a campus protest over the university’s decision to end Grace Pearson Scholarship Hall’s gender-inclusive living arrangements. Alvarez, a 21-year-old student, expressed his frustration with the elimination of inclusive spaces where students feel safe. While he identified himself as a proctor, akin to a resident assistant, he did not claim to speak in his official capacity as a resident assistant for KU.
The university placed Alvarez on probation for failing to refer media inquiries to senior KU staff. Before the window to appeal the probation closed, Alvarez was subsequently fired from his position, and he was forced to rescind an offer to continue as a proctor the next academic year.
“I think it’s a bad sign that for infractions as little as this, you could get fired and kicked out and very quickly find yourself in a position where you have to find a place to live,” Alvarez told Kanas Reflector in April.
The lawsuit argues Alvarez “engaged in protected speech by speaking to a member of the media in their capacity as a private citizen on a matter of public concern — specifically by criticizing Defendant KU’s policies and practices related to housing policies for LGBTQ+ community members as applied to recent state and federal legislative directives.”
Precedent for resident assistants, who are students and employees of a university, fired for speech is largely undeveloped. However, First Amendment challenges, added restrictions and demands for universities and rollbacks of LGBTQ+ rights are becoming commonplace under President Donald Trump’s second administration.
A vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, Alvarez testified in January against a bill in the Kansas Legislature that bans gender-affirming care for minors and restricts the use of state funds for promoting gender transitioning. The bill made it through the House and Senate, was vetoed by Gov. Laura Kelly and ultimately became law after the Republican-controlled Legislature overrode the veto.
Representing Alvarez is Barry Grissom, former U.S. Attorney for Kansas, who argued in the complaint that as a result of KU’s actions, Alvarez experienced a “loss of living quarters, income, reputational damage, emotional distress, and the deprivation of constitutionally protected rights.”
Grissom filed suit not only to address the university’s retaliation toward Alvarez but also to garner a judgment from the court on whether the policy that led to Alvarez’ probation and termination is constitutional, Grissom said in a Thursday news release.
“Terminating a public employee after they speak to the media and criticize that employer’s policies is certainly in line with some of the challenges we have seen of late to the First Amendment, one of the bedrock principles of the American legal system,” Grissom said in a statement to Kansas Reflector.
He continued: “Speech that the government does not agree with is exactly the kind which the First Amendment was intended to protect — yet each day, there are seemingly more people affected by policies like the one which cost Mr. Alvarez his job.”
The lawsuit names KU; Sarah Waters, executive director of KU housing and resident life; and Emily Chellgren, assistant director of resident life, as defendants. Multiple attempts beginning Friday morning to reach KU for comment for this story were unsuccessful. By Friday afternoon, most staff members had set up out-of-office messages for Memorial Day weekend. KU also did not respond to requests to comment in past coverage of this story.

Chittenden County State's Attorney Sarah George said on Friday that Eaton's commentary during a Friday court hearing provides ""greater context than we've had for a possible hate crime enhancement.""
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Defense attorneys ask for new competency hearing for man accused of shooting Palestinian students after troubling court hearing[...]","Jason Eaton appears in Chittenden Superior criminal court in Burlington on March 8, 2024. Eaton is charged in the shooting of three college students of Palestinian descent in Burlington in November of 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerJason Eaton, the man accused of shooting three Palestinian students in Burlington in 2023, claimed without evidence during a court hearing on Friday that he had been acting under the instruction of the Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.He said during the hearing that the three victims were associated with Hamas, and suggested he would pursue a public authority defense in his case because of his claimed ties to the CIA.Eaton’s comments came during a court hearing to review motions he filed to gain access to the victims’ cellphone data, which Burlington police collected from them with their consent in the hours after their shooting. His motion also sought access to a Homeland Security document compiled after the incident.Reviewing the victims’ cellphone data, he said, could help bolster his defense. He later asked Superior Court Judge John Pacht for permission to hire the head of defense at Palantir Technologies to review the data and brief the court on their findings.Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George suggested during the court hearing that Eaton’s comments in court provide some evidence for a hate crime enhancement.“I do not believe this has any credibility at all,” George said of Eaton’s comments. “In fact, I think it is providing greater context than we’ve had for a possible hate crime enhancement.”Eaton was deemed competent to stand trial in the fall. But on Friday, his defense attorney, Peggy Jansch, of the Chittenden County Public Defender’s Office, asked the court to order an updated competency hearing, citing his comments in court.READ MORE
Eaton’s comments offer some insight into his defense strategy, and shed some light into his state of mind when he allegedly shot Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad on Nov. 25, 2023.The three students, all 20 years old at the time, were in town visiting one of their families for Thanksgiving. They were walking on North Prospect Street, speaking a mix of Arabic and English and wearing kaffiyehs, a traditional scarf that is a symbol of Palestinian identity, when Eaton approached them from a nearby porch and allegedly shot all three.He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted second-degree murder charges, and has been held without bail at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans since his arrest soon after the shooting.His comments Friday prompted backlash from the victims’ attorney, William Clark, who said his clients were moving forward with a protective order to prevent access to their data.“I’m not letting my victims be harassed under a completely frivolous theory of defense that does not even have an ethical ground to be able to be raised in court, regardless of its legal infirmity,” Clark said. “It’s pure harassment if they go forward with a deposition that’s asking about some of the allegations you’ve heard today.”George has said previously that a hate crime enhancement against Eaton was unlikely, and that she did not have enough evidence to support such a charge.She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether she would pursue a hate crime enhancement.Eaton’s court case has lagged over the last year. He has repeatedly clashed with his attorneys over their defense strategy and has asked the court twice to fire them.He claimed in a handwritten motion filed in April that his counsel insisted on an insanity defense “to which I do not consent.”He claimed that they “refuse to investigate and prepare a defense based on the facts which I have disclosed for them” and claimed they would “prepare no other defense on ethical grounds.”“They have failed at their paramount obligation to be loyal to their client — going so far as to undermine my credibility on the record by stating that they are exploring an insanity defense,” he wrote.Jansch has supported Eaton’s motions for access to the victims’ cell phone data and other records throughout the case’s development.“I have an obligation to see if there’s any factual support for Mr. Eaton’s defense,” she said on Friday.But she appeared hesitant to push for his public authority defense. “If you want to raise it with the court, that’s up to you,” she said to Eaton in an aside on Friday. “I’m not going to.”Pacht entertained Eaton’s theories during the hearing Friday, but questioned whether it was “an expression of a disorder that hasn’t been reviewed yet which Mr. Eaton suffers from.”Regardless, Pacht noted the proposed line of defense had little to no factual basis to bring forward.“I know of no law that would suggest that if a state police officer said, ‘This guy is a bad guy, he’s done lots of things, he’s really hurting the community, and it doesn’t seem like anybody’s doing anything about it, I’m authorizing you to do it yourself’ — that would clearly be a violation of law, as far as I can see,” Pacht said.Pacht denied Eaton’s bid for new defense attorneys. He did not rule on his motions for cellphone data or federal government records — saying he would issue a written decision — but noted later that he was “not hearing why the cellphone data” would be material to the case.The court extended the timeline for discovery in the case. Pacht said Friday that the case would not be ready for trial until at least the fall.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Defense attorneys ask for new competency hearing for man accused of shooting Palestinian students after troubling court hearing commentary.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jason-eaton-4-20240308-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

Timothy Beckmann was arrested in late September and found incompetent to stand trial due to mental health diagnoses. He was ordered into Department of Mental Health custody in January, joining the list of hundreds of people waiting in jail for a state mental health bed to open up.
Just before 5 p.m. on Monday, 64-year-old Beckmann was found unresponsive in his cell in the Jackson County Detention Center cell, according to the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. 
He was brought to a local hospital, where he was declared dead.
Beckmann hadn’t been convicted of any crimes — his case was on pause while he waited months for mental health treatment. 
The cause of death is not yet known. The sheriff’s office, which oversees the jail, told The Independent it is investigating the death and the medical examiner’s office has not yet released a cause of death. The medical examiner’s office told The Independent no reports could be released under public records law while the case is still under investigation.
But in the seven months he spent in pretrial detention, Beckmann’s mental and physical health deteriorated, the public defenders overseeing his case told The Independent on Friday. They say his death is a tragic consequence of the state’s ballooning waitlist for mental health treatment, which leaves people languishing in jail for over a year on average. It’s also an indictment, the public defenders say, of the state’s inadequate support for those with mental illness.
“What happened to Timothy Beckmann is horrific,” said Annie Legomsky, who runs the state public defense system’s holistic defense services program, “and what makes it all the more tragic is that it was entirely preventable.”
She said jails are not equipped to help people with mental illness.
“The inability of our jails to provide appropriate psychiatric care for these individuals is something we’ve been trying to sound the alarm for for a while,” Legomsky said, “and unfortunately, it’s not a surprise that now someone has tragically ended up dying because they weren’t able to get the care they deserved.”
The Missouri Department of Mental Health declined to answer a list of questions, citing patient privacy protections. 
Jackson County Sheriff Darryl Forté also declined to answer specific questions, citing patient privacy, but wrote by email that the “death of an individual in our custody is a matter we take with the utmost seriousness and care. We are committed to thoroughly examining all circumstances surrounding such incidents, and this particular case remains under investigation.”
 A ‘life or death matter’

Missourians who are arrested and declared incompetent to stand trial wait in jail an average of 14 months before receiving treatment, according to data shared with The Independent earlier this month. Treatment generally includes therapy and medication and is referred to as competency restoration. 
There were 418 people on the waitlist earlier this month.
Those being held in jail are sometimes incarcerated for longer than they would be if they’d received the maximum sentence for the crime they were charged with. There have been successful lawsuits in other states arguing the practice violates due process and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Anthony Vibbard, the deputy district defender in Jackson County who oversaw Beckmann’s case, said Beckmann had been in and out of different mental health facilities over the last few decades.
He was arrested and charged with second degree burglary and first degree property damage, according to court records, after breaking a glass door of a home and entering.
Vibbard said Beckmann had been recently released from a mental health facility when he was arrested, and was left “wandering the streets of Kansas City” — where he wasn’t from and had no family. He said Beckmann entered the home because he was tired and hungry and was looking for something to eat.
Vibbard said once Beckmann was in jail, “his condition started deteriorating to the point where he started self harming.”
Vibbard and Legomsky said after he was detained, Beckmann started pulling out his toenails, scratching himself and “losing touch with reality.” At one point, they said, he stopped eating or taking his blood pressure and heart medication. 
The process of getting court orders for mental health examinations and referrals to the Department of Mental Health can take months. In Beckmann’s case, he was finally ordered into the department’s custody Jan. 21, nearly four months after he was arrested.
His attorney “sounded the alarms” in court, Vibbard said, trying to talk to judges, convince the department to expedite his treatment and making records of her concerns. Beckmann came to court “visibly frail,” Vibbard said, with “scabs and wounds on his body.” 
The legal team received reports he was being restrained due to his behavior, which the sheriff’s office declined to comment on. The jail has been sued in the past for its use of restraint chairs.
“[His attorney] made records over and over saying like that, this is bad. Something bad could happen. He needs to be in a hospital and not a jail,” Vibbard said.“…And eventually we got the word that Mr. Beckmann died number 109 on the waiting list for admissions.” 
The department declined to confirm that Beckmann was number 109 on the waitlist at the time he died.
Legomsky said despite legislative and court concerns, more needs to be done to remedy the competency restoration issue, “so that people like Mr. Beckmann don’t die locked up in a cell, strapped down.”
“If people don’t know what’s happening,” she said, “and they don’t realize that it’s a life or death matter, I’m worried that the status quo will continue.”

Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.
The proposal, which identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George, was included by Maloy as part of Congress’ budget package.

But on Wednesday evening, Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross, rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip Maloy’s proposal from the budget bill during a House Rules Committee meeting.
“I worked hard with my colleagues in the House and locally elected officials to make sure that the one big, beautiful bill represented the unique needs of Utahns,” Maloy said in a statement Thursday. “My lands amendment would have delivered critical relief to fast-growing communities in my district.”
However, Maloy acknowledged it was removed from the reconciliation package, which she voted for.
“I still supported the bill, because it delivers a strong economy that will benefit Utah and the country as a whole,” she said. “I will continue to fight for Utahns to responsibly manage federal lands that currently landlock our communities and hinder economic growth.”
 Congresswoman says proposal would have helped expand water, transportation, housing infrastructure

Maloy, in an earlier statement, said the land would help the southwest corner of the state expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure, as the region deals with rapid population growth. St. George was eying an airport expansion; the Washington County Water Conservancy District had plans to build a new reservoir; Washington County was looking to widen some existing roads.
In a statement, St. George city leaders thanked Maloy for working on the amendment, and they plan to have more talks with lawmakers on the issue.
“We were disappointed that some groups falsely presented this amendment as if it were a land grab,” city leaders said. “In actuality, the amendment was intended to protect existing critical infrastructure or future critical infrastructure that would be built on already disturbed public lands. Only approximately nine acres would have been used for attainable housing, at a spot adjacent to a future cemetery and an existing residential subdivision.”
The Washington County Water Conservancy District issued a similar statement, telling Utah News Dispatch it respects Congress’ decision to remove Maloy’s amendment.
“We appreciate Congresswoman Maloy’s efforts to facilitate the availability of federal lands for exchange in a manner that would benefit the water district,” the statement reads. “The water district remains committed to securing the necessary federal lands in Washington County for critical water infrastructure projects through established, traditional processes.”
Maloy’s amendment identified a total of 70 parcels to be sold in Utah. The proposal had a far greater impact on Nevada, with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei earmarking nearly 450,000 acres for disposal in his state.
 Environmental groups, public land advocates said bill lacked parameters on what land could be used for

The proposal received broad criticism from environmental groups and public land advocates, who said the bill lacked language mandating what the land would be used for. They argued there was nothing stopping the governments from purchasing the land, then using it for something other than the originally stated purpose. And some of the land abutted rivers and popular recreation areas, including Zion National Park, prompting concerns over access and environmental harm.
The proposal also had its critics in Congress, on both sides of the isle, including Zinke, who called it his “San Juan Hill,” referring to a famous Spanish-American War battle.
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release on Wednesday.
Environmental groups celebrated the decision, issuing a flurry of statements and reactions.
Travis Hammill, the Washington, D.C., director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said Maloy is the “latest in a long list of politicians with the bad idea to try and sell off public lands.”
“The through line of those failed efforts is this: love of public lands transcends geography and political party. Americans don’t want to see these lands sold off and time and time again have risen up to make their voices heard,” Hammill said.
Kyle Roerink executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said Zinke’s move to tank the disposal “sends a strong message to lawmakers of all stripes: We can never break the public trust and the Colorado River for billionaire tax breaks.”
Others noted the bipartisan opposition to the amendment, including Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who called the attempt “appalling” and “Gilded Age-level stuff.”
“Republicans’ public lands fire sale was so greedy even their own caucus wouldn’t support it,” Donnelly said in an emailed statement. “I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”
According to the amendment’s text, about 70 parcels were identified to be sold off to four entities, at market value. Consider:
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid


Washington County would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres.
The Washington County Water Conservancy District would have been allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.
St. George would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.
Beaver County would have been allowed to purchase three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

The amendment was a small part of what President Donald Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill” that has been in the works for months. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax law, cuts steps out of the energy permitting process, increases defense and border security spending, and makes substantial changes to Medicaid.
The bill cleared the House early Thursday and is headed to the Senate.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Memorial Day weekend is typically considered the opening weekend for summer water recreation, but for some Iowans the thought of diving headfirst into a lake sounds more concerning than refreshing. 
Driftless Water Defenders, an environmental group based in northeastern Iowa, is launching an initiative to bring awareness to the “deteriorating quality” of Iowa’s water and its impact on summer recreation. 
The first beach monitoring report of the season, issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, shows the department does not recommend swimming from beaches at four of the 41 monitored state lakes.

Nine Eagles, Black Hawk, Beeds Lake and Backbone beaches under advisory
DNR tests waters at the beaches weekly during the summer season, from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, for E. coli bacteria and microcystins. 
When levels of either exceed safety levels, DNR issues a beach warning which is not a closure, but an advisory to visitors that the water “may carry a higher risk” of causing things like diarrhea, nausea or other acute symptoms.
According to a press release from DNR, advisories are especially important for Iowans with weakened immune systems, young children or those who plan to swim and might ingest water. 
Advisories are issued when E. coli levels are higher than 235 colony forming units, or CFU, per 100 milliliters. At this threshold, the estimated illness rate is 36 minor illnesses per 1,000 swimmers. High concentrations of E. coli can also signal that other bacteria or pathogens are present in the water. 
The DNR beach monitoring also logs county and city beach test results. As of Friday, beaches at F.W. Kent Park, Hickory Grove Park and Lake Iowa Park had E. coli values above the standard. 
Microcystins, which DNR also monitors at beaches, are toxins produced by types of blue-green algae that can cause acute health effects, like rashes, nausea, diarrhea, or fever. These algal blooms appear as green “paint-like” scum on bodies of water and should be avoided, especially if they have an oily appearance. 
According to DNR, Iowa saw seven microcystin-related beach advisories in 2024. The blooms occur in nutrient-rich waters, which are exacerbated by industrial and agricultural runoff. 
Iowa Environmental Council monitors the lake data throughout the summer as well and reported  23 state park beaches had swim advisories in 2024. IEC also noted Green Valley Lake, Honey Creek Resort Beach, and Lake Anita as the only monitored state lake beaches that have never had an E. coli related advisory. 
DWD initiates clean-water dialogue at state lakes
The 48 Lakes Initiative, headed by Driftless Water Defenders, will kick off Saturday at 10 lakes across the state with in-person meet ups and the distribution of water quality statistics at each lake. Attendees are encouraged to share their experiences of recreating in Iowa lakes and how it has changed over time. 
Chris Jones, the organization’s president, said industrial agriculture practices are polluting the waters and “depriving” Iowans of recreational opportunities. 
“The Iowa citizens’ dialogue we are starting today will help citizens to increase the accountability of polluters and governmental agencies responsible for enforcing the state’s environmental laws and regulations,” Jones said in a statement. 
Those interested in attending a Saturday meet up can find more information online.
The organization hopes the citizen-initiated dialogue will persist through the summer on social media and it encouraged folks to share their stories with the tags : #NoSwimEra and #48Lakes.
Food and Water Watch, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Progress Iowa are also supporting the initiative. Mazie Stilwell, the executive director for Progress Iowa, said the state’s rivers, beaches and lakes should be enjoyed “free of worry.” 
“But for Iowans, you either enter at your own risk or heed the warnings for fear of getting sick,” Stilwell said in a statement. “Iowans are making it clear they’re done with politicians and wealthy executives who let these waters deteriorate … These are our waters, it’s time we turn the tide and clean them up.”
Additional safety precautions for the holiday weekend 
Lake temperatures are still fairly chilly for swimming, as the latest fishing report issued by DNR shows most waters measured in the mid 60s, but the department encouraged Iowans to wear lifejackets and stay safe if they do decide to take a plunge. 
Additionally DNR reminded those camping at state parks to avoid transporting firewood, as it can spread insects like the emerald ash borer or oak wilt.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)This week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Delegates advanced a mega bundle of bills designed to shave billions from the federal budget, which Democrats and advocates have said will take resources from the nation’s most vulnerable citizens and hinder social safety nets. Virginia’s congressional delegation was split along partisan lines on the measure, which cleared the House by one vote and is now up for consideration in the U.S. Senate.
The 1,116-page package contains 11 total bills and is championed by President Donald Trump, and supported by Virginia’s Republican federal lawmakers including U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman, Jen Kiggans, John McGuire, Ben Cline and Morgan Griffith. The legislation aims to extend  2017 tax cuts from Trump’s first term at a cost of $3.8 trillion, trim $880 billion from the federal deficit and boost defense and border security spending by cutting several federal social aid programs or incentive packages.
The measure calls for a $625 billion cut to Medicaid over the next decade, which the state’s Democratic federal legislators — including U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, Bobby Scott, Suhas Subramanyam, Euguene Vindman, Don Beyer and deceased Congressman Gerry Connolly, who died days before the vote — have cautioned and voted against. 
Medicaid is a federal program that helps states provide health insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. The newly-passed measure would impose work requirements on those who receive it and reduce Medicaid funding to states that choose to use the program for undocumented immigrants. Virginia has specific guidelines for which legal immigrants can qualify for Medicaid and state legislators have considered creating work requirements for Medicaid enrollees in the commonwealth in the past. 	

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


While it’s unclear exactly what toll the federal measure’s cuts would take in the state if it passes, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee estimates 161,614 Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage. Meanwhile, some citizens, like Central Virginia residents Aida Pacheco and Andrew Daughtry, are voicing opposition to the work requirements. 
Pacheco’s daughter is currently unable to work while undergoing breast cancer treatment that Medicaid helps her cover, she said. Daughtry, a construction worker unable to work temporarily after an injury, has used Medicaid because he did not have employer-provided health insurance and now is out of work temporarily due to an injury that needs surgery and physical therapy. 
Pacheco and Daughtry joined U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, on a recent press call, where McClellan said the proposed overhauls to Medicaid could cost taxpayers more money in the long run. Uninsured people are inclined to only seek emergency medical care, rather than preventative care. Because emergency rooms are federally required to treat all patients, care for uninsured patients who cannot pay could become a shared financial burden on taxpayers. 
“When you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else,” McClellan said. 
 Virginia’s congressional Republicans weigh in

In contrast, Virginia’s Republican representatives have celebrated the proposed changes, framing them as a big step towards fiscal responsibility and a better use of the country’s resources. 
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, told The Mercury before the bill cleared the House that his GOP colleagues “proved the other party wrong” by not making “massive, significant cuts to Medicaid.”
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

And though the projected $625 billion in cuts indeed qualify as “massive,” the federal funding tool that allocates Medicaid money to states called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) has not changed. Should the bill pass the Senate and be signed by Trump, many beneficiaries would remain covered, though changes like the work requirements could affect some Medicaid recipients. It’s a detail of the bill that  many Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, have pointed out. 
Wittman also framed the bill’s work requirements as “community engagement requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents” in a Thursday statement and emphasized that pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities would still be covered. 
“I’ve fought to protect and preserve Medicaid for Virginia’s most vulnerable, and this bill does just that,” he said. He added that the bill “strengthens the integrity of the program, saves taxpayers billions, and ensures care is available for those who truly rely on it.”
In April, he’d also co-signed a letter to Republican U.S. House leadership cautioning the legislative body not to cut too much from the program. 
Likewise, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virignia Beach, characterized the bill as a way to strengthen, not destroy,  Medicaid. 
Kiggans said in a statement on X that she voted in favor of the measure because it “puts people first by protecting Medicaid for vulnerable families, delivering tax relief and child care credits to working Virginians, investing in our servicemembers and shipbuilders, and cutting wasteful federal spending.”
As Kiggans represents Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, anchored in Virginia Beach, she and her predecessors from both parties have been considered vulnerable incumbents in elections. The district has oscillated between partisan control over the years, placing its representatives under heightened scrutiny for votes they take. 
Though the 1st Congressional District has been historically Republican-leaning, its absorption in redistricting of blue or politically purple Richmond suburbs has made it an opportunity for Democrats to try to flip. This spring, some constituents hosted a town hall and invited Wittman to hear their concerns about the federal cuts, but he didn’t show up.
Wittman constituents host town hall in his absence to address immigration, federal funding concerns

Though congressional elections aren’t until next year, the impact of their votes concerning Medicaid remain to be seen. 
In the meantime, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows that about 10.3 million people nationwide would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during that 10-year budget window. 
 As possible Senate rewrite looms, more Virginians could lose insurance if FMAP is altered

The “Big Beautiful Bill,” as Trump has called it, is not yet law. It still must pass the Senate chamber before he can sign it. 
Some GOP senators are calling for a rewrite of it to address a range of concerns to include the bill’s projected impact on federal debt, the phaseout of clean energy incentives and notably, the reforms to Medicaid. A key sticking point from Senate conservatives is concern that the bill doesn’t do enough to cut future deficits.
With some Medicaid recipients already standing to lose access as the bill has so-far advanced, further changes to the in-progress bill — like addressing the FMAP — could put about 630,000 more people in health insurance limbo. 
This is because when lawmakers were compromising to expand Medicaid in 2018, they settled on trigger language that would upend the expansion if the FMAP were adjusted.
Virginia’s private hospitals have financially supported the state’s Medicaid expansion since 2018, and are closely monitoring federal developments. 
Julian Walker, a spokesperson for the Virginia Hospitals and Healthcare Association, said that the organization is glad Virignia’s congressional delegation across both aisles has been listening to its feedback and is appreciative that the FMAP was not altered in the current draft of the bill. 
Walker said earlier this year that hospitals have been “proud” to help sustain Virginia’s Medicaid expansion, but acknowledged uncertainty about what lies ahead.
State lawmakers are monitoring the situation too. 
Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, suspects the legislature would need to go into a special session if the Medicaid expansion were undone but he also believes that congressional actions could wrap up in time for the 2026 Virginia General Assembly session. 
“It could turn out we know everything we need to know by the time our regular session starts,” he said. 
Or, he added, if Congress takes too long and has to pass continuing resolutions, they could still be sorting through final details of their proposal as Virginia’s legislature begins meeting early next year. 
As chair of the House of Delegates’ Health and Human Services committee and vice-chair of its Appropriations committee, Sickles is watching Congress closely.
“We need to see what they actually do,” he said. 
He echoed McClellan’s warnings about the potential financial burden to Virginia taxpayers if people unenrolled from Medicaid are forced to seek more care from emergency rooms. 
“In the end, the savings that (Republicans are) claiming are going to come from fewer enrollees in Medicaid, the cost of their health care does not go away,” Sickles said. “There is no free lunch if you’re not enrolled in Medicaid.”

Jan. 3, 2024. Photo: Jim NeugerThe chambers are not always aligned on every bill. When the Maine Senate votes one way and the Maine House of Representatives another, they have a chance to reconsider or alternately to “insist” on their position. If they are unable to reconcile their differences, legislation then dies in nonconcurrence (though technically they could be recalled with a two-thirds vote). 
Some of the  bills that died in this fashion: LD 542, which would have established municipal property tax levy limits, restoring provisions of a law that was repealed in 2023; LD 828, which would allow chiropractors to be designated as school health advisors; LD 1013, which would require voter approval if a municipality is seeking to issue a $10 million or more bond; LD 421, which would have repealed certain driver’s license suspension provisions to eliminate barriers to reentry. 
Most of the action has moved out of committees and to the House and Senate floor. After Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) whizzed through a stack of bills on Thursday, Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) complimented her speed, sayingshe got faster each bill, clocking in at under 35 seconds from the opening to closing of the last. “Bravo,” he said.
Some other votes of note:
Members of both chambers overwhelmingly supported what was dubbed the “famous chicken bill,” (LD 1655) which bars a county or municipality from adopting a regulation that prohibits a person from keeping chickens on their residential property. “Time to put the chickens to roost,” said Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor).
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 698) that provides ongoing funds to emergency homeless shelters in Maine.
The majority of the House and Senate backed a bill (LD 599) to raise the salary threshold for overtime pay. During debate in the Senate, where it passed 18-14, Labor Committee Chair Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) said the threshold is in need of updating and that it would help prevent employers from misclassifying employees to deny them overtime.
House and Senate lawmakers narrowly backed legislation (LD 538) that would amend Maine’s prescription drug labeling law by allowing someone who prescribes abortion drugs, including mifepristone, misoprostol and generic alternatives, to remove their name. Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) said the proposal comes directly from providers who have been subject to harassing phone calls and targeted bomb threats and are concerned about their safety and the safety of their families. Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport), who voted against the bill, said it shouldn’t be thought of as a referendum on abortion but rather an issue of medical transparency and the public’s right to know who is prescribing powerful drugs.
After passage in the House last week, the Senate voted 18-14 to back a bill (LD 1080) to prohibit public utilities from requiring deposits based solely on a residential customer’s income. 
Both chambers unanimously backed legislation (LD 1360) requiring the Secretary of State to provide the option for a driver’s license or a nondriver identification card that does not meet the standards of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005. (Read more about the issue here).
They also supported a bill (LD 530) that would eliminate the provision that presumes bar applicants who had been convicted of a crime punishable by at least one year in prison don’t have the good moral character required to be a lawyer. Bill sponsor Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland) said he proposed it  after conversations with someone who was formerly incarcerated and had to spend a lot of money to become a lawyer. Boyer argued, given the state’s indigent defense crisis, that Maine should take steps to allow more people to become lawyers. He also noted the bill doesn’t go as far as the recommendations of the American Bar Association on the matter.
The chambers voted to back LD 1123, which provides ongoing funds to establish two positions to facilitate MaineCare reimbursements for local school districts. During the House floor debate, Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education Committee, said the state has left millions in Medicaid funding in Washington, D.C. that could have come to Maine schools and students. The new positions are meant to help the state better access those reimbursements.
Lawmakers unanimously adopted a bill (LD 1604) that seeks to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters.  (Read more on that here).
Emergency legislation (LD 1022) to increase funding for the civil legal services fund, which supports the provision of free legal services to low-income defendants, passed the Senate by a vote of 30-2 and the House 96-46. 
Both chambers voted in favor of a bill (LD 784) to require health insurance coverage for specialized risk screening for first responders. Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), who voted against the measure, said he wasn’t opposed to firefighters receiving health insurance, but said his party believes the Labor Committee should be dealing with this issue with a workers comp lens. Sen. Donna Bailey (D-York) said the insurance committee has dealt with the issue twice and said with this bill they are “trying to give coverage upfront.”
Both chambers also supported legislation (LD 666) that would provide $2.5 million each year to the Department of Corrections for certified domestic violence intervention programs.
Both chambers voted unanimously to back a resolve (LD 1148) directing the Secretary of State to study providing access to absentee ballots for municipal elections to uniformed service voters or overseas voters as it does for statewide elections.
They also overwhelmingly backed a provision (LD 1576) that would extend the one year lobbying prohibition for former executive branch employees to also include former employees of the legislative branch. 
Following the action of the House, senators voted 19-13 to reject two bills (LD 189 and LD 743) that would eliminate the requirement for health care facilities to obtain a certificate of need for the provision of mental health and substance use disorder services. (You can read about a similar proposal last session.)
Following the House last week, the Senate voted 18-14 to reject a bill (LD 451), which would require operators of wind or solar developments to test for PFAS and, if so, determine if contamination was “reasonably caused” by the development. While proponents argued that solar panels are “leaking PFAS into the ground,” Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) pointed out that Maine has already passed bans on products with intentionally added PFAS, which includes solar farms. “The purpose behind it is not PFAS,” he said of the bill, but rather it’s to slow down the growth of renewable energy.
A resolution (LD 492) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to provide for “parental rights” was rejected by the Senate 19-17 following a House vote against the measure last week. (More on this here). 
Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) argued the amendment would restore parental control over what happens to their children. “We’ve got to give parents the proper respect and rights to guide their children to adulthood the way they see fit,” he said. However, Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) pointed out that, “Maine already has constitutional rights for parents that are greater than most states” and said the amendment would undermine court rulings related to parents rights.
The House and Senate rejected a bill (LD 935) that would direct the Department of Environmental Protection to report on air and soil chemical and metal levels on solar farm sites. Proponents said they are concerned about solar energy installments having unintended consequences with the leaching of certain chemicals. However, Rep. Victoria Doudera (D-Camden) said the department doesn’t have the capacity or funds to test each of the more than 700 solar sites in Maine.
Both the House and Senate voted to reject a bill (LD 266) that would require voter signatures to be updated every five years. 
A bill that would repeal the laws allowing same-day voter registration (LD 349) was rejected 125-18 in the House and under the hammer in the Senate. During the House discussion, some Republicans noted that their voters use same-day registration more than any other party.
The Senate voted 19-13 against a resolve (LD 635) directing the state attorney general to drop its climate change lawsuit against Big Oil companies. Before the House voted 81-65 against the measure, Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) declared climate change a “hoax,” saying it is 100% physically impossible to prove that any fossil fuel use has had anything to do with climate change. (The vast majority of scientists, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, say burning fossil fuels is the largest driver of climate change). Other critics argued the attorney general should be putting resources into battling the drug epidemic instead, to which Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) responded that he has and it produced monetary settlements.
Both chambers voted to reject a provision (LD 206) that would eliminate the automatic cost-of-living adjustment to the minimum hourly wage.
Following the committee recommendation, the chambers voted to reject a proposal (LD 220) to establish a scholarship for students enrolled in certain private schools or homeschooled that would shift state and district funding allocated for each student to the accounts.
Following the House vote last week, senators voted 17-14 to reject legislation (LD 174) that would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. 
After the Senate failed to garner enough votes to enact (LD 771), the chambers are now split over a provision to amend the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances. Supporters said the change addresses a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances.
Similarly, a bill (LD 16) that would establish separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine is also in nonconcurrence after the House rejected the measure. Having initially voted against the measure, the majority of the Senate voted against enactment and then accepted an amended version of the bill, which would create a new prosecutorial district for Washington County. 
The chambers are also divided over legislation (LD 639) that would remove the requirement that the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s law enforcement training program must be a residential program. After the Senate backed an amended version of the proposal, the House voted several times and ultimately insisted on its position against the bill.
And a proposal (LD 53) to establish the November General Election Day as a school holiday for school buildings used as voting places is in limbo after it passed the House but was rejected by the Senate.

House action
The House voted under the hammer to back LD 747, which if passed would provide rental assistance for students experiencing homelessness. (More on this here).
The House first took up the minority report rejecting legislation (LD 738) that would remove barriers to becoming a lawyer by allowing an individual who has studied law for four years in a law office study program under the supervision of a qualified judge or attorney to qualify for the bar exam without attending law school. The House rejected that move, voting 54-92 before backing the bill under the hammer. It was tabled in the Senate.
After initially taking up and rejecting an amended version of a bill (LD 301) that would allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish performance-based metrics and rate-adjustment mechanisms for a public utility, the House voted against the legislation that proponents said would help hold the state’s utilities accountable. (Read about a similar proposal last session).
The House also voted 97-18 against legislation (LD 1160) to prohibit ownership of 6% or more or control of a public utility by an entity providing aid to a foreign terrorist organization. Sponsor Rep. Nathan Carlow (R-Buxton) said it  “sends a clear message to America’s enemies” that “those systems are not for sale and they never will be.” However, Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said while well-intentioned, enforcement of the bill is “not feasible” as  what constitutes a terrorist organization is determined by federal law.
The House voted 109-33 to reject LD 160, which would eliminate REAL ID requirements in Maine. (Read more about the issue here).

The Healey administration announced it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027.
The post DEP delays electric vehicle sales requirements for two years appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE HEALEY administration said Friday it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027, administratively taking a step that lawmakers have repeated sought to force legislatively.Under the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation that Massachusetts adopted following California’s lead in 2023, vehicle manufacturers are supposed to produce and make available for sale a gradually-increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles starting at 35 percent in model year 2026, rising to 43 percent in model year 2027 and eventually hitting 100 percent in model year 2035 and beyond.The Department of Environmental Protection said Friday that it “will exercise enforcement discretion” for model years 2026 and 2027 and declared that “manufacturers shall not withhold internal combustion vehicles from car and truck dealerships seeking those vehicles.” MassDEP has similarly deferred enforcement of related minimum electric truck sales requirements.“EVs should be the most affordable and clean option for cars,” Gov. Maura Healey said. “We’re giving carmakers more runway to invest in their manufacturing and supply chains, which will help ensure customers have additional affordable electric vehicles options at dealerships in the future. Massachusetts will continue to invest in charging infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.”Delaying implementation of the ACC II regulations has been a topic of amendments filed to the spending bills that have been moving between the House and Senate recently. This week, Millbury Sen. Michael Moore withdrew his budget amendment to delay implementation for two years but highlighted what he said would be devastating economic consequences of keeping the rules in place when both demand for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure lag previous expectations.“By enforcing this rule, manufacturers will have to artificially manipulate vehicle inventory to force more zero-emission vehicles into the state while reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles available,” Moore said. “Looking at last year, 280,000 new vehicles were sold in Massachusetts. To artificially meet the 35 percent threshold, there would have to be a reduction of 198,000 gas-powered vehicles, representing a $9 billion reduction in economic activity in Massachusetts.”Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr called for a two-year delay to the ACC II regulation Thursday afternoon in a speech on a Senate budget amendment that was ultimately sunk.“Number one, the electric grid is not ready to handle it. And number two, the demand for these vehicles has not proven to be as robust as we had hoped, and consumer uptake is not nearly where it would need to be to comply with those regulations,” he said.Environmental advocates slammed the MassDEP decision Friday. Environmental League of Massachusetts Legislative Director David Melly said the organization is “disappointed to see Massachusetts walk back its commitment to Advanced Clean Cars II, causing delays that will harm our communities and the environment.”“We know that timely progress on electrification of vehicles reduces both transportation emissions and healthcare costs. Our state leaders must step up to fill the gap this policy leaves behind, including firm commitments to expanding charging infrastructure statewide and addressing vehicle pollution in overburdened areas,” he said.Healey’s office said it will “soon announce dedicated additional grant funding for the purchase or lease of electric vehicles for publicly owned fleets, electric school buses, waste collection vehicles, and other vocational vehicles.” It also previewed an announcement related to “enhanced future grant funding opportunities for existing programs that support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging, charging at multi-unit dwellings and educational campuses, charging at workplaces and for commercial fleets, and publicly accessible charging stations through the MassEVIP program.”The post DEP delays electric vehicle sales requirements for two years appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Electric-Chargers.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)A patient whose ovaries were removed without her knowledge during colon surgery can sue the doctor who she says recommended the procedure, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In the opinion, five of the Court’s seven justices agreed that lower courts were correct when they refused to dismiss the patient’s lawsuit. With the ruling, the case is sent back to Rock County Circuit Court.
The patient, Melissa Hubbard, was being treated for endometriosis in 2018 by an obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Carol Neuman. During the time, Hubbard also was referred for surgery to remove a section of her colon.
The surgery was performed by Dr. Michael McGauley. During the procedure, Hubbard’s ovaries were removed, but she wasn’t told beforehand that would be part of the operation.
Hubbard initially sued McGauley, but that lawsuit was dismissed. She subsequently sued Neuman, charging that — without telling her — the OB/GYN had suggested to McGauley that he remove Hubbard’s ovaries during the colon surgery.
The lawsuit charges that when Neuman made the recommendation to McGauley, she violated Hubbard’s right to informed consent under Wisconsin law.
Neuman’s lawyers filed a motion in Rock County circuit court to dismiss the lawsuit on saying that, in the context of the surgery, Neuman was not Hubbard’s “treating physician” under the informed consent law. 

Neuman’s lawyer argued that because the state law’s informed consent requirement applies to the “treating physician,” Hubbard had no case against Neuman since she did not perform the surgery and she never gave a formal order to the surgeon to remove Hubbard’s ovaries.
The circuit court judge denied the dismissal motion, and the state 4th District Court of Appeals agreed.
With Friday’s opinion, the Wisconsin Supreme Court also denied the motion to dismiss the case.
“We disagree with Dr. Neuman,” Chief Justice Anne Walsh Bradley wrote on behalf of the majority. “The essence of the inquiry is whether Hubbard’s complaint sufficiently alleges that Dr. Neuman was a ‘physician who treat[ed]’ Hubbard, even though she did not actually remove Hubbard’s ovaries herself. We conclude that it does.” 
Bradley was joined in the majority by Justices Rebecca Dallet, Brian Hagedorn, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz.
According to the opinion, the complaint depicts “Neuman’s intimate involvement with the removal of Hubbard’s ovaries” — first, diagnosing Hubbard with a severe case of endometriosis and then advising her to consider removing her left fallopian tube and ovary.
“Second, after Hubbard agreed to undergo colon surgery, Dr. Neuman allegedly helped plan the surgery with Dr. McGauley,” Walsh Bradley wrote. “The physicians’ pre-surgery discussions and plans included Dr. Neuman’s plan to attend and participate in Hubbard’s surgery and to remove Hubbard’s ovaries herself. Hubbard also alleges that Dr. Neuman recommended to Dr. McGauley that he remove Hubbard’s ovaries.”
Those allegations in the lawsuit are enough to consider Neuman a treating physician in the case, Walsh Bradley wrote.
Justice Annette Ziegler, joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley, disagreed. 
“To be a treating physician under [the informed consent statute], the physician needs to either provide the treatment at issue himself or formally order the treatment at issue,” Ziegler wrote, citing the text and history of the law along with “the decisions of courts across the country that have addressed who qualifies as a treating physician.”
While Hubbard never told Neuman she wanted her ovaries removed and never consented to their removal in the surgery, Ziegler wrote, “the complaint never expressly alleges, nor reasonably implies, that Dr. Neuman performed or participated in the surgery or attended the surgery.”

Wagers are not currently allowed on the website in Rhode Island, though state regulators are now considering letting vendors such as FanDuel operate in the state. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A new report commissioned by the Rhode Island Lottery recommends the state should add four to six new online sports betting vendors to boost its competitiveness with its neighbors, but only if it makes itself more attractive to popular companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.
The report published by Spectrum Gaming Group on May 1 notes that there is no prohibition against increasing the number of authorized service providers beyond the one app currently managed by the gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology.
But when Rhode Island Lottery renewed its contract with International Game Technology (IGT) PLC to run the state’s digital sportsbook, it was with a clause that the company would have the exclusive rights to handle all digital wagers through November 2026.
State lawmakers have sought to end IGT’s monopoly of Rhode Island’s digital sportsbook, but such proposals were never going to head to the House floor this year.
“There is no need to adopt legislation this year because the state is under contract with the current vendor for another year,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement to Rhode Island Current.
Rhode Island Lottery, however, is now starting to consider upping the number of apps beyond the existing Sportsbook RI. Director Mark Furcolo informed the legislative committee that oversees the state’s gambling sector on Monday that the lottery intends to issue a request for information (RFI) on the matter in early 2026.
“The purpose of the RFI is to gauge the level of interest in, and by which companies, providing a sports wagering product here and if not, why not,” Lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said in an email.
But companies may not be fully interested in expanding to Rhode Island due to its 51% tax on operators’ revenues — which is tied with New York and New Hampshire for the steepest in the country. When the state inked IGT’s initial contract in 2018, it was the only bidder to respond to the lottery’s request for proposals.
Spectrum suggests the state lower the tax rate.
The report also recommends that the state allow online betting servers to be hosted outside of the state’s two existing casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton — where any company would have to pay a 17% hosting fee to Bally’s Corp. Such a change would require a constitutional change approved by Rhode Island voters. 
Spectrum’s recommendations come as legislators have introduced bills this year to open up the market beyond the single app managed by the gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology.
The companion bills by Rep. Matthew Dawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone would allow at least five sports betting vendors to open by July 1, 2026 — opening the door for companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel to take wagers in a state where they’ve been barred from doing so since the state first launched sports betting over five ago.
Sports bettors have one app in R.I. More may be on the way.

Ciccone’s bill received its initial hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming, which he chairs, on April 30. Dawson’s bill was heard by the House Committee on Finance on May 1. Both were held for further study, as is standard for an initial vetting by a legislative panel.
“We need more competition,” Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, said in an interview. “If you have a monopoly, you have no reason to innovate.”
The state was the first New England state to legalize sports wagering in 2018, but neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts have since entered the market and have only eaten away Rhode Island’s revenue.
Massachusetts, which launched online sports betting in March 2023, collected nearly $10.4 million in taxable revenue solely from wagers on the seven apps available there in just March of 2025. 
Connecticut, which has three sports betting vendors, brought in $21.4 million in tax revenue in fiscal year 2024.In the same time period, Rhode Island saw $19.2 million in sports betting revenue transferred to the state’s general fund.
“There’s a significant amount of tax revenue we’re not getting because we’ve decided we’re going to let one company run the whole thing,” Dawson said.
Fiscal notes on what Rhode Island could receive should it expand to five sports betting vendors have not been filed by the House and Senate. But Ciccone and Dawson point to Washington D.C., where wagers increased 172% in the last year after its Council approved expanding sports betting to additional platforms.
“That’s significant,” Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, said in an interview. “And with the problems we’re having, why not try to bring in more players and see what we can do?”
Ciccone was referring to the state’s TK deficit heading into the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026.
Along with additional revenue, Ciccone and Dawson argue that many users don’t like the existing Sportsbook RI app. Dawson told Rhode Island Current he knows several bettors who go to the McDonalds in Seekonk, Massachusetts to place bets from apps other than IGT’s.
Lack of promotions and bonuses have made up many negative online reviews users have left on App Store and Google Play. Ciccone said his friend, the late Senate President Ruggerio, also had issues with the limitations of IGT’s online sportsbook.
“He hated that app,” Ciccone recalled.
Shekarchi said he has never used the app, but that he has heard both positive and negative experiences from others who have used it.
IGT spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said the feedback the company receives tends to be positive.
“We work with the Lottery to ensure a great player experience with the Sportsbook RI app,” he said.

Political corruption has been our brand for a Long time – pun intended. There are few corners of the state that haven’t been touched by greed, envy and every other sticky finger of those in power.
This sordid history serves as the backdrop for what would be a very significant rewriting of Louisiana’s ethics laws, with Gov. Jeff Landry behind the pen.
In this episode of “The Light Switch,” senior reporter Julie O’Donoghue walks us through just a few of the changes being proposed. They include increasing the limits on gifts for elected officials and government employees, ranging from the governor down to your local building inspector.
Read Julie’s coverage of the ethics proposals lawmakers are considering:

Confidential complaints against elected officials, gov’t workers might be eliminated
Lawmakers might lift limits on gifts to officials, gov’t employees
As charges linger over Landry, Louisiana House votes to overhaul ethics investigations

Also weighing in on the ethics topic is Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council. The 75-year-old good government group doesn’t take stands on legislation, but its leader says he’s concerned about the possible changes in the works.
For our News from the States segment, we head to Indiana where there are changes in store for the naturalization ceremonies where new U.S. citizens take their citizenship oaths.

At first, in the haze, they look like birds, perched on fence posts along the road. But they don’t shift or take flight, and there’s one on every post for as far as I can see. They are upside-down boots.

“I’m so grateful to the people who get up every day and do the work in the grueling and the awful conditions,” says Jozee Zuñiga, an environmental activist and the daughter of a man who worked in the oil fields. “But I want people to know that, yes, we depend on it. Yes, we need it. But that doesn’t mean we have to surrender.”

The road, Buck Jackson, cuts south through southeastern New Mexico, across the fields where companies are drilling for oil. I drive for almost three miles before I stop seeing boots above the sparse grasses and the thorned mesquite and the trash. A Chevron sign marks a plot of land beside them, and the heavy silhouettes of pump jacks and processing plants hover behind them. Bootheels point up to the sky.

The oil workers wore them. Then they retired and hung them up, or traveled to oil fields elsewhere and hung them up, or died, and their relatives and friends placed them there. On a black rubber boot, in white marker, someone wrote “6/13/20, R.I.P.” and a name that has worn away.
“6/13/20, R.I.P.” David Cox/Searchlight New Mexico
“They leave their memories there,” a former oil worker, who asks to go by the pseudonym Diego García, tells me. García, 36, is undergoing chemotherapy treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which he developed while cleaning sites contaminated with drilling waste. He’s worried that employers won’t hire him again if they learn he spoke to a journalist. “Some people leave pants, too.” He laughs.
I think about what the workers stood on when they wore the boots — rigs, spilled oil, tanks, truckbeds, caliche — and how many hours they wore them, during shifts that could span five straight days and nights, no sleep. These were hours of absence, when the workers were away from home, and the people who loved them couldn’t see them. And the fence becomes a fence between the fields and home.
Separating from the world
“A good day,” says Marcos Carranza, “is a day without danger.”
It’s 6:30 p.m. or so, November, at a house in the city of Hobbs, about an hour northeast through the fields from Buck Jackson. Two highways that lead to the worksites cross through town: State Road 18, north to south, and U.S. Route 62, west to east. Billboards for injury attorneys mark city boundaries. At night, the neon signs and floodlights of hotels and motels illuminate the highways. The parking lots are full of work trucks. The hotels are interspersed with smoke shops and restaurants and stores that advertise workboots and beer. Rows of houses, mostly brick with pitched roofs, line the quiet streets that stem from the highways.

The Carranza family’s front door is wide open, a rectangle glowing bright on the dark row of houses. The children and grandchildren of Carranza and his wife, María Elena, sit together on big couches beneath family photographs. The rich smells of rice and chicken with mole rise out of pots and pans on a table in the back of the room. Carranza is at the table, exhausted. He got home maybe 20 minutes ago from his job constructing pipelines for an oil company.
“A bad day is an excess of hours working and a lot of danger, because you can fall asleep driving, or on-site, and a machine hits you, and you can lose your life,” he says. (We’re talking in Spanish, which I use when interviewing most of the workers I meet.)
On previous jobs, Carranza says, he’s had to enter tanks where oil and natural gas are stored, to clean them. The containers are metal and round. They usually range in size from 10 feet tall and 12 feet wide to 30 feet tall and 15 feet wide. Even in bigger ones, it’s difficult not to feel claustrophobic inside. They contain hydrogen sulfide, a gas found in natural gas deposits. Exposure to low levels can cause nausea, headaches and insomnia. Exposure to high levels can cause memory loss and death.
“Sometimes when you wash the tanks, hydrogen sulfide is released, and when that happens, you can pass out,” Carranza says. “That would be a very bad day.”
Though he’s never passed out himself, he’s seen fellow workers collapse many times. Sometimes they survive falling into the liquid at the bottom of the tank. Sometimes they don’t.
Over the chatter of television news, Carranza’s children and grandchildren are teasing each other and arguing about politics. His voice mixes with theirs as he tells me about a slower, quieter toll the industry has exacted on him over the past 17 years. He’s 67 and technically retired, but he receives no employer-sponsored benefits, and the meager Social Security payment he gets — around $1,000 a month — isn’t enough to sustain his family. He’s continued to work for the oil and gas industry, at $16 an hour, 50 or 60 hours a week, because it’s “the economic activity of New Mexico,” he says.
The companies that have employed him haven’t consistently provided proper safety training or equipment, and the exposure to dangerous chemicals and loud machinery is gradually separating him from the world. He can’t smell the dinner María Elena prepared. He thinks it’s because he’s inhaled so much hydrogen sulfide, which can cause olfactory paralysis. He’s losing his vision, hearing and memory.
Because he’s losing his memory, he loses hours on the road. He’ll be driving somewhere and suddenly can’t remember why he’s there or where he’s going. He can’t drive María Elena to medical appointments because he has to work during the day. He turns his head to show me a golf ball–sized lump in his neck and says he’s not sure whether he’ll be fired when he asks for a day off to go to the doctor.
“The money that one earns, one pays a very steep price for,” he says. “There are times when I’ve felt depressed. You work so much, but it’s not worth it, because health can’t be bought. And there are irreversible effects, and you can’t be the same as before. As much as I want to think well, see well, I can’t now.”
Because of his disabilities, he can’t find other work. He’s so experienced at building pipelines that he can keep doing it despite the challenges he faces. No one else will hire him.
“There’s no alternative,” he says. “My back is against the wall.”

“Thank you, Chevron”
When I look out my car window at the gas flares leaping into the sky, I imagine the roar and snap of flames. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 60 percent of all workers in the “mining and oil and gas extraction” industry have been exposed to hazardous noise, and a quarter have difficulty hearing.

But on the dirt roads beside the flare stacks — the tall metal chimneys where gas is being burned off the crude oil so that it doesn’t explode — all I hear of the flames is a rush of heat through metal pipes. It’s hard to distinguish it from the whoosh of moving trucks, which you could pretend is the sound of the ocean that filled the Permian Basin hundreds of millions of years ago, were it not for the clank and rattle of equipment and the constant machine buzz.
The sea creatures and algae in the ancient ocean decomposed into the oil that a water-well driller found south of Carlsbad in 1901. Speculators began drilling throughout southeastern New Mexico. Nearly three decades later, in 1928 — with crews working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in bunkhouses full of rattlesnakes, and wooden rigs catching fire and burning to ash — they struck enough oil to start a boom. Within two years, 20,000 people flocked to Hobbs, according to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
New Mexico’s dependence on oil and gas revenue is historically high: Roughly 40 percent of the state’s general fund comes from fossil fuel production in the Permian Basin, in the state’s southeast corner, and in the San Juan Basin, in the northwest corner. Drilling in the San Juan has been slowing down, but the Permian, which covers roughly 86,000 square miles in eastern New Mexico and west Texas, is booming. It’s the most productive oil field in the United States. Almost half of all U.S. oil comes from the basin, and about a third of that comes from New Mexico. As a producer, the state is second only to Texas, which has a larger share of the resource.
In the counties of Lea, Eddy, Chaves, Otero and Roosevelt, New Mexico’s Permian covers around 13,000 square miles. When people fly over the region, they see a flat, mottled landscape with various small cities — Hobbs, Artesia, Carlsbad, Lovington — clumped around highways.
Throughout these communities, you can smell the hydrogen sulfide. People suffer from cancers, respiratory illnesses, chronic nosebleeds, headaches and thyroid problems — all conditions that have been associated with industry air pollution. Creosote and mesquite choke out native grasses. Among the creosote and the mesquite are old tires and beer bottles and Red Bull cans and broken pipes. Birds ingest toxins and have been seen falling dead out of trees and sky, and the noise and the floodlights interfere with animals’ circadian rhythms.
“They can’t sleep, they can’t eat properly, they can’t properly forage for food and they can’t reproduce,” says Charlie Barrett, a field ecologist and thermographer with Oilfield Witness, a nonprofit that uses infrared cameras to expose emission levels.
Pump jacks near Hobbs. David Cox/Searchlight New Mexico
In Hobbs, there are pump jacks on signs and murals around town. In Carlsbad, Jozee Zuñiga, an environmental activist, tells me that representatives of the oil companies give children coloring books and tell them about how they protect animals in the fields. “The school I went to my last two years of high school has a ‘Thank you, Chevron’ on its sign because Chevron donated to fix the school’s labs,” she says.
She tells me that support for the industry drowns out any talk of workers’ conditions. At local boutiques, she sees hats that say “Rig Daddy” and shirts that say “Permian Proud.” She went to a feed store to pick up dog food and heard a man at the register shout at the cashier, “Drill, baby, drill!”
“It’s not only their livelihoods, but it’s the culture that they participate in,” she tells me. “If you speak out, or you go against the grain, you are considered a threat. And not just a threat to a company or a specific procedure or operation. People consider you a genuine threat to their personhood, their lives.”
Zuñiga’s father was a supervisor in the oil fields before he passed away in 2016. She still has his work number in her phone, and his work clothes and boots are in a closet. She describes herself as privileged, because his hours were somewhat regular, but he was always on call, even during vacations, and he woke up at three every morning to head for the job.
“I remember hearing him walk down the stairs,” she says. “And I remember being so excited some days coming home from school, because, from the road, I could see that his truck was already there, and he had come home early. But that was not all the time.” Some days, coming home, she still looks for his truck.
“I’m so grateful to the people who get up every day and do the work in the grueling and the awful conditions,” she says. “But I want people to know that, yes, we depend on it. Yes, we need it. But that doesn’t mean we have to surrender.”
Two million barrels a day
On the roads and at gas stations, there are workers everywhere. Trustworthy data on the size of the workforce is hard to find, however. Fossil fuel employees account for less than three percent of New Mexico’s total labor working population, according to the state’s Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS), but other estimates are much higher — closer to 10 percent. A study done by the University of New Mexico found that around half of oil and gas workers are Latino, but advocates in the Permian say that the number is probably much higher.
Jorge Estrada, a public relations coordinator at the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), told me it would be “extremely difficult” to provide a complete list of oil and gas companies operating in New Mexico’s Permian, a claim reflected in state documents. Driving around the region, I pass dozens of company names on buildings and vehicles. In 2024, almost 400 fossil fuel companies were operating across the state, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG, Coterra and ExxonMobil, according to an annual production report from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division. Together, these companies ramped up production from around 800,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 to a little over 2 million barrels per day in 2024.

Just how much oil money funds the state is in dispute. According to the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, in 2024, oil and gas brought in $13 billion in state and local revenue, $7.4 billion of which went to the general fund. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, says that at least $4.7 billion from the industry went to the general fund, though he noted that the figure could be higher. Either way, the money is used for public education and health and human services, among other state programs. But politicians and state officials, who receive large donations from fossil fuel companies, rarely acknowledge the toll the industry takes on workers.
Scanning thousands of pages of state legislation from the past 30 years, I found few mentions of the workers. I saw no bill that has as its sole aim bettering their workplace conditions, and no memorial acknowledging the costs of what they do — though I did find memorials honoring uranium workers and promoting safety in the mining industry.
Some bills contained sections intended to help fossil fuel workers transition to other industries, or to direct agencies to implement rules for their safety. Those didn’t pass. In the 2025 session of New Mexico’s legislature, the House signed a memorial recognizing “the oil and gas industry … for its vital contributions to the state” with no substantive mention of the workers. The office of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declined my request for an interview. Grisham, alongside state lawmakers and political action committees, received roughly $800,000 from fossil fuel companies in 2023.
State agencies seem to be taking little action to protect workers. Estrada wrote that the NMED’s “primary attention is on maintaining the well-being and safeguarding of all employees or workers,” noting that New Mexico established a safety program in 2005 to “reduce fatalities and catastrophic events” and to enforce the New Mexico Occupational Safety and Health Act (NMOSHA) industry-wide.
“The potential for serious accidents, catastrophic accidents, and worksite fatalities has been recognized for the Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing Industry,” says an official state notice announcing the program. “Statistical data shows this industry accounted for a far greater percentage of workplace fatalities and serious accidents in New Mexico than would be expected for such a relatively small workforce.”
The program aims to conduct 25 random, unannounced inspections per year, though they only did 23 last year. In a landscape of close to 400 companies, that number is hardly comprehensive. “It is not possible to keep an accurate or current universal listing of employers or their equipment,” the notice states.
Federal labor law has not been consistently enforced in the state — standards for overtime pay have not guaranteed that oil and gas workers will be justly compensated for working more than 40 hours per week. A federal investigation in 2014 found that companies owed upwards of 1,300 fossil fuel workers in New Mexico and west Texas at least $1.3 million in overtime. And the law sets no limits on how many hours employees may work.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who serves southern New Mexico, is trying to pass a bill that would require oil companies to compensate workers for respiratory and heat-related illnesses. “I’ve personally sat down at the dinner table with folks that have been working in the industry for 16 years and lost their job and were offered a $200 check with no medical care or compensation,” Vasquez tells me. “That is just outrageous to me, considering the record profits that oil and gas companies are making.”
The pushers
Fossil fuel companies in the Permian are private operations that lease drilling rights on both public and private land. “No Trespassing” signs are posted everywhere to mark off worksites, and environmentalists documenting pollution told me stories about workers chasing them away from well pads.
My attempts to visit worksites and “man camps” — rows of mobile homes where companies house employees, with as many as 20 people reportedly crammed into a single trailer — got nowhere. Using state documents, I contacted 40 companies listed as producing large amounts of oil in the region. Three smaller companies politely declined what one secretary described as “the opportunity.” The others didn’t respond. So I learned about the labor conditions by talking to workers off-site, in parks, restaurants, homes and over the phone.
During one call, a former oil field worker named Félix Rodríguez tells me that many workers receive no safety training and have to provide their own safety equipment. He began building tank batteries — collections of tanks that store crude oil before it gets processed — when he was 19. But he quit a year in, after witnessing an explosion. He’s now an organizer at the Roswell chapter of Somos un Pueblo Unido, a statewide workers’ rights organization headquartered in Santa Fe.
Small companies are “trying to cut costs at all times,” he says, while big companies will often contract with small ones, going for the “cheapest bidder” and not “batting an eye at the working conditions.” The small business Rodríguez worked for — which built both tank batteries and flare stacks — provided him with a hard hat. He and his fellow workers had to buy all other safety gear, including glasses and monitors that record hydrogen sulfide levels. The company appointed him safety manager, he says, because he speaks Spanish and English, but he had no training. “If I didn’t have any training, and I’m training these people to be safe, how safe is it?”

The state does not appear to have a reliable method for tracking worker deaths. The NMED told me that five workers died in oil and gas extraction and support industries in 2022. The count is less than half of what the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reported: 11 deaths that year. The agencies are consulting different databases — the NMED count is based on reporting by employers, while the NMDOH count comes from the data an occupational health surveillance team compiled using the department’s vital records. Neither includes deaths that were caused by labor conditions and occurred after workers left the fields: fatalities connected to the long hours, grueling effort and diseases developed from exposure to toxic chemicals.
Even if it were possible to resolve the discrepancy between the different counts, the numbers would probably still be incomplete. “Sometimes, companies cover these things up because it saves them a lot of money,” Marcos Carranza says.
Even so, by sifting through 20 years of investigations conducted by the New Mexico Occupational Safety and Health Bureau, I found disproportionately high numbers of accidents in the oil and gas industry, compared to other industries in New Mexico. In 2022, for instance, slightly less than half the accidents described in the bureau’s investigations for that year involved activities in the oil fields.
The summaries listed at the top of the investigations were blunt descriptions of workplace accidents: “employee is killed when struck by pressurized air and sand”; “employee is killed when struck by falling support beams”; “employee is burned when hydrogen sulfide gas ignites”; “employee thrown from oil well rig platform and is killed”; “employee is killed by explosion while gauging levels of crude oil”; “three employees are killed when oil tank explodes”; “employee sustains burns when sprayed with sodium hydroxide”; “employee dies from a 90 foot fall”; “drill field worker is crushed and killed under truck”; and “employee is struck and killed by flying material.” There were dozens more.
One man I interview, who asks to go by the pseudonym Juan Campos for fear of retaliation, shows me one of his hands, which he can’t close into a fist. He injured it on a shift in the 1980s while facing pressure from supervisors. He and other workers call the supervisors “pushers.” He says one pusher forced him to approach a tire that was filling up with air while he was carrying a lighter, and the flame ignited the air. The explosion knocked him to the ground. “If the pusher didn’t pressure you,” he says, “there would never be accidents.”
“We experience disillusionment, impotence and anger”
The harm the industry inflicts on workers goes beyond violent accidents. “If it’s not a full-on explosion, it’s rarely talked about,” Rodríguez says. “This is an industry where you have to be a macho man and have to work hard to succeed. Mental health is downplayed.”
Workers and their loved ones suffer from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. According to a 2023 CDC report on 2021 suicide rates by industry and occupation, workers in “oil and gas extraction and support activities for mining” experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any labor force in the country: 73.9 per 100,000, which is more than double the overall rate in the civilian non-instutionalized working population. Daniel Radabaugh, a chief operations officer at a national pipeline company called Xccelerated Construction Unlimited, has estimated that workers’ mental health challenges cost the oil and gas industry $200 billion a year due to high turnover and reduced productivity.
A recent survey of 126 workers in the New Mexico Permian — conducted by political scientists at the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy — found that they often struggle with substance use disorder and mental health issues. The study reports that workers experience loneliness and exhaustion, often having to sleep through their days off. One woman described her husband becoming “really skinny” and “drying up” because of exposure to the chemicals required for extraction. “Those tanks are like death,” she told the researchers. “We experience disillusionment, impotence and anger because we are completely hopeless.” Close to 80 percent of the oil field employees surveyed didn’t want their children to work in oil and gas.
Maria Romano, a lead organizer at the Hobbs chapter of Somos un Pueblo Unido, says she’s observed workers turning to drugs and alcohol for relief. Campos lost several friends — fellow oil workers — to cirrhosis, and he suspects it’s because they drank so much. While building flare stacks, Félix Rodríguez once found himself 50 feet in the air with a coworker who wasn’t safely hooked to any part of the structure, and who was high on cocaine.

Romano also describes “a lot of disintegration of the family, many divorces.” She says that her ex-husband — who she divorced 20 years ago — worked in the oil fields when they were married, putting in such long hours that her daughter asked whether he lived in the same house with them. “When he got home, she was already asleep,” she says. “And when he left for work, she was asleep.” The girl’s teachers assumed Romano was a single mother.
Another organizer, Gladys Resendes, who’s currently married to an oil worker, says, “When my children have a problem, they go to me, because he’s never there.” Rodríguez says that most of his coworkers were divorced “at least once.”
Workers often say they choose the industry for the money. Annual mean wages range from around $50,000 to $77,000, according to 2023 estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These wages are significantly higher than New Mexicans’ per capita median income between 2019 and 2023, which was $34,823. According to the UNM survey, though, 20 percent of workers who responded were making less than $25,000 a year. More than half didn’t have health insurance, and nearly half reported experiencing accidents on the job. Eighty five percent of those who experienced an accident said they felt it could have been prevented.
Workers I talked to laughed when I asked whether companies provide access to mental health professionals. Community organizers told me that workers tend to be closed off to conversations about the emotional challenges they endure.
Many belong to a population statistically less likely to receive treatment for mental health, for reasons of stigma, racial and anti-immigrant discrimination and poverty. The majority of those who work in the fields are male, and research has shown that men in the U.S. are less likely to seek mental healthcare and more likely to struggle to express emotion. The rate of suicide among men is four times that of women. Studies indicate that Latinos in the U.S. — a significant portion of the state fossil fuel workforce — receive mental health treatment at roughly a 25 percent lower rate than the average population. Several of the workers are undocumented, which makes them vulnerable to exploitation by their employers and less likely to have reliable access to any medical care.
“No one else is going to do the work they do,” Romano says.
Usually workers are too afraid of being deported or losing their jobs to consider approaching attorneys, advocates or therapists if they experience abuse. “A lot of people feel very uncomfortable even reporting an accident,” Rodríguez says. One worker he knew ended up in a coma for two weeks, with fourth-degree burns, after an oil tank he was cleaning exploded. The company paid the hospital bill and gave him $35 in compensation. He stayed on because he couldn’t find work elsewhere. “He’s undocumented,” says Rodríguez. “He can’t really fight it.”
To make matters more precarious, the future of the industry is not stable, even with President Trump’s promise to boost production. Economists predict that drilling won’t increase dramatically in New Mexico in the years ahead. And the president’s stances aren’t consistent — he promises to expand drilling, and he also promises to deport the undocumented people who do most of the work. “Donald Trump wants to ‘drill, baby, drill,’” Rodríguez says, but “you’re not going to be able to without the immigrants.”
The threats of deportation and state violence are likely to intensify the pain workers already endure: studies demonstrate that anti-immigrant policies lead to higher rates of depression, anxiety and PTSD among undocumented immigrants. ICE has reportedly been arresting and disappearing people from around New Mexico, including the Permian, but their identities and whereabouts are unknown. Advocates predict that undocumented oil field workers will not be safe from ICE raids, despite the industry’s power.
Uncertainty stems from the positions of New Mexico’s state government, too, as officials discuss a possible turn to green energy and to a new reliance on permanent fund investments. Workers fear they’ll be left without jobs. “Whenever the time does come that oil and gas is shut down — the boom is no longer booming — we need to be able to have an education to be able to transfer to new jobs,” Rodríguez says.

A pain too severe
U.S. 285, one of the highways that runs through the Permian — Roswell to Artesia to Carlsbad, all the way down to Sanderson, Texas — is known as the “highway of death.” In the heavy traffic of oil industry vehicles, exhausted drivers lose their grip on the wheel, drift across the road and crash. “There was an accident almost every single day that we drove there,” Rodríguez says.
Then there are the state and county roads that lead to the drilling sites — NM 128, for instance — and have only two lanes. Workers often get stuck behind long lines of trucks they can’t safely pass, so even when a workday is over, they have to spend hours waiting to get home — to their houses in Hobbs or Carlsbad, or to the man camps throughout the region.
The man calling himself Diego García tells me that he worked such long hours that he lived on the oil fields in his truck for two and a half years. For $23 an hour, he hauled soil — contaminated by chemicals from fracking and drilling — away from work sites to waste sites off 285 and 128, replacing it with new soil and a cleaning agent.
“I don’t know the names of the chemicals, but they’re chemicals so strong that you don’t need to inhale them close-up for them to contaminate you,” he says. “We worked hard to get rid of the contamination quickly because we knew the wind carries it and spreads sickness.”
The soil he cleaned probably contained radionuclides — radioactive forms of elements, found deep inside rock, which are dredged up during the drilling process.
For months, García and his team worked 10-hour days, waking at 4 a.m. His body adapted to the schedule so that he’d wake at 4 even on days off. But the hours could “grow longer.” There would be a site that required immediate remediation, and the supervisors would push workers to go five days and nights straight, without sleep, “working, working, working.” They agreed to the jobs, no matter the schedule, out of fear that companies would fire them if they said no or set limits.
Accidents occurred regularly. Sometimes workers were burned by chemicals or gas, or they lost limbs to heavy machinery. “One slip-up and there goes an arm or a leg,” García says. Sometimes the machinery blew up. “I watched machines catch fire,” he says.
The men had to eat on the job, often canned soup they’d packed in their trucks. The wind blew chemicals into their food and ruined it. Many downed Red Bulls or Monsters to stay awake. García preferred coffee or cold water. When the weather was bitter, they heated drinking water by turning on their trucks and placing bottles beside the engines.

García endured the long hours by listening to music — Vicente Fernández, Los Temerarios, sometimes Christian songs — and by taking care of his team members, just as they took care of him. The hardest times were in the middle of the night, when their bodies bent toward sleep, or the middle of the day, when the sun burned over them. “We’d say to each other, ‘I can’t bear it now, I need to sleep a little while,’” he says. Then, as one man slept for an hour or so, the others would look out for supervisors, who docked pay for sleeping. “We always covered each other’s backs.”
On the road to a job, García sometimes passed workers who’d parked in the desert to get drunk. He laughs when I ask whether the men talked about their feelings. That kind of talk, he says, would be “rare.”
“We chatted about the funny things, so we wouldn’t cry at the wheel,” he says. “Yes, one carries one’s things from work, but one buries them in the truck cab.”
One day at dawn on a worksite in the desert, after years of these irregular schedules, García felt a pain in his stomach so sharp he had to lie down in his truck. He woke up at two or three the next morning and got back to work, but the pain returned.
“It was a pain too severe,” he says. It brought him to his knees. He couldn’t stand. His friends drove him to a hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with ALL. Around two-thirds of ALL cases occur in children. When it shows up in adults, it tends to affect people over 50. García is 36. Patients are known to develop ALL after being exposed to high levels of radiation. García was responsible for clearing waste that was probably full of radionuclides.
Two other men García worked with got sick, though he doesn’t know the names of their illnesses. Much of the money they earned had to be spent on treatments. García did not ask his company for compensation, nor did they offer any. His family and friends have supported him through chemotherapy.
People choose to do the work “to get ahead,” he says. “But it brought me equal consequence, because with so many chemicals — well, look.” He motions to himself. During chemo, he lost his eyebrows, hair and beard. He says he recently passed good friends in a grocery store aisle, and they didn’t recognize him.
I ask whether he’d hung his boot on a fence post along Buck Jackson Road.
“No,” he laughs, “because I want to return to work!”
“A price that’s too high”
It was late January 2022, cold enough that ice glazed the roads. César Gómez, who was in his mid-thirties, had worked every night, maintaining wells and rigs from sundown to sunrise — sometimes past sunrise — for two and a half months. One sunrise, he was riding toward rest in a truck cab. But the driver hit ice, and the truck skidded across the road and rolled. Gómez was thrown through the windshield, shattering his spine and his foot. He woke up from a coma two weeks later in a hospital in El Paso.
“‘Work,’ ‘company,’ ‘accident,’ ‘lawyer’ and ‘money’: These are the five words that most people think about in this field,” Gómez tells me. With each word, he waves a finger. When I ask if he received compensation from the company, he issues a dry and hollow laugh. Then he nods. “It doesn’t matter the quantity of money I receive,” he says. “It won’t give me back my normal life.”
He’s wearing a T-shirt that says “Fatherhood.” We’re talking in a back office of Somos un Pueblo Unido. Sitting in a little swiveling office chair beside gray filing cabinets and newspaper clippings and succulents, he tells me about the other workplace, “el campo petrolero,” which feels distant but is all around us. He started working on rigs 12 years ago, when he was 24, for “more money, a better life — something like that.” There were no regular hours and no guaranteed holidays. He made $16 or $17 per hour. His day shifts, including driving time, could run from 3:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. His night shifts, including driving time, could go from 5:30 p.m. to 7 a.m.
“Working at night is super, super tiring, stressful,” he says. “It’s a sensation that I don’t know how to describe. But it’s ugly. Because, first of all, you’re not in your five senses. You’re sleepy, you’re cold.”
Supervisors blamed workers for accidents. “At work, they’d mention that someone had an accident, someone died, someone crashed,” he said. “We’re not indispensable to anyone. We’re only a machine to make money for the boss.”

As we talk, he rubs his legs to ease the pain in his back. He shows me an X-ray of his spine, which is full of metal pegs, and he looks at a photograph of his face, bruised and swollen and full of tubes, from when he was in a coma. “I’m talking without crying because I’m trying to hide it. But, obviously, I’m unwell, physically and mentally,” he says. “I don’t like talking about this subject. It sends me back in time.”
Gómez says his personality has changed. He can’t lift more than five pounds and isn’t sure if he’ll ever be able to work full-time again. He’s afraid of driving, especially in rain or snow, and he’s in so much pain all the time, in any position, that it’s nearly impossible to sleep. When he does sleep, he has nightmares. He forgets information and events from one day to the next. “For example, today, in this moment, I’m talking to you,” he says. “Tomorrow I won’t be able to remember parts of our conversation.”
His marriage is falling apart. He blames the accident and his resulting despair. As part of the compensation he received from the company, he meets weekly with a psychologist, and he’s been trying to talk about his marriage, but the psychologist says that he’s not interested in talking about relationships. He’s not a couples therapist, he tells him, he’s a psychologist of accidents and violent trauma. Gómez’s claims adjuster won’t respond to his messages.
“The accident damaged my mind most,” he says.
To help himself think less about his stress and his pain, he cuts other oil workers’ hair, listening to their problems and advising them. The week before we talked, he gave a haircut to a man who has to work Monday through Sunday with no days off. The man’s wife is struggling with his absence and has threatened to leave if he can’t spend more time with their family. He asked his supervisor for a weekend. His supervisor said no. “I’m at the point of losing my family, my wife, because I’m working so much,” he told Gómez. Gómez told him to look for another job, one with a set schedule, Monday to Friday.
“I would give everything — everything, everything, everything — to be well,” Gómez says. “If I could turn back time — obviously, I can’t — but if I could, I think I’d like a job in a shop. I don’t know. But I would never return to the oil fields.”
He imagines walking through the fields, telling the workers to be careful, to leave.
“It’s not worth it,” he says. “You pay a price that’s too high.”

“That’s good news,” said Walthall County Emergency Director Royce McKee on Friday, over two months since the storms hit. “Everybody will be happy we can start picking up the debris. People will start to see the light at the end of tunnel.”
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it didn’t know yet how much money would come to the state. MEMA did confirm that the federal government would cover 100% of costs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Individual Assistance aid — a program that sends direct payments to those affected by the storms — and 75% of costs for FEMA’s Public Assistance, which pays for repairs to public infrastructure. The state and local governments will split the remaining those costs.
The 11 counties that qualified for Individual Assistance are: Covington, Grenada, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jefferson Davis, Leflore, Marion, Montgomery, Pike, Smith and Walthall. The 17 counties that qualified for Public Assistance are: Calhoun, Carroll, Covington, Grenada, Humphreys, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jefferson Davis, Lee, Leflore, Marion, Pike, Prentiss, Sharkey, Smith, Walthall and Washington.

Residents impacted by the storms can apply for assistance through this online portal, by calling 1-800-621-3362, or on FEMA’s mobile app. 
The March storms killed seven Mississippians and injured dozens of others, while damaging nearly a thousand homes, according to MEMA’s tally. Of those homes, the storms destroyed 164, and left another 204 with “major damage,” which usually means a home is no longer habitable. 
In Walthall County, McKee said over 100 homes were destroyed or received major damage. The biggest priority with FEMA’s support, he said, is taking care of displaced residents who are either living in hotels or staying with family.
“We’re a poor county and have a lot of people that don’t have insurance,” McKee said. “It’ll be leaps and bounds for them trying to get back to normal.”
Starting next week, FEMA will have in-person stations in Mississippi to enroll storm victims in assistance programs. MEMA Director of External Affairs Scott Simmons said the state agency will soon make information on those locations available on its website.
In Leflore County, where the storms damaged 314 homes, Emergency Director Fred Randle said it took a while for insurance companies to reach some places, and even then there were “a lot” of costs that insurance didn’t cover. 
“We had a lot of people (where) it was two weeks before the insurance adjuster could get out and check their home because there was so much damage everywhere,” Randle said, adding that while it was nerve-wracking waiting over two months for the decision on FEMA aid, it was good news to receive going into the holiday weekend. “It’ll help us tremendously. Something to help celebrate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/17152739/Tylertown-tornado-damage-16.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 20:09:19+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT nursing home, group home strikes called off after deal reached",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-nursing-home-strike-called-off/,The SEIU 1199 president said a deal reached with the Lamont administration involved ‘meaningful progress on a pathway to $30’ per hour.,"The state’s largest health care workers’ union reached a last-minute deal Friday with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration to avert strikes set to begin Tuesday that would have involved more than 6,400 caregivers at 51 nursing homes and 193 group homes for people with disabilities.
The president of SEIU 1199NE, Rob Baril, confirmed Friday afternoon that union leaders and worker representative committees had endorsed the package negotiated late Thursday night and early Friday morning with the administration.
Full details weren’t available Friday afternoon, but Baril said, “We did make meaningful progress on a pathway to $30,” referring to the union’s objective of boosting nursing home worker hourly pay — which currently ranges from $18 to $22 for most staff — to $30 within the next few years.
Group home workers also “move ahead in a way that is important and meaningful,” he said.
The deal also includes a state investment of $164 million over the next three fiscal years combined in nursing facilities and $149 million over the next two in group homes, Baril said.
“The workers in our nursing homes and group homes provide critical support and care to our most vulnerable residents, and in doing so deserve salaries that reflect their dedicated work,” Lamont said. “I am proud to reach an agreement that provides workers with a significant increase in their compensation for the next several years while also addressing the workforce crisis facing many of our nursing and group homes.”
Baril said he realized that negotiations were challenging for state officials, given that Congress is eyeing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and other programs, which could cost Connecticut huge amounts of aid from Washington.
Though the work stoppage planned for Tuesday morning is on hold, several more steps need to be accomplished, given that caregivers have been working under contracts that expired back in March.
Lamont and the General Assembly must approve a new two-year state budget that includes the Medicaid payments needed to implement this deal. The governor and legislative leaders are optimistic about wrapping up a new budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
And private nursing and group homeowners, who receive the bulk of their funding from the state, still must negotiate wage and benefit agreements with SEIU 1199NE. Baril estimated that process will require at least several more weeks.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, praised Lamont and union leadership for averting a work stoppage.
“A nursing home strike, which at its core separates caregivers from residents, is nothing short of harmful, traumatic and costly as was the case in 2001, when 40 homes went on strike and it was a full month before all the striking workers were back delivering care,” he said. “All parties who had a stake in this year’s strike threat, especially the nursing home residents and their caregivers, can rest easier tonight because of today’s announcement.” 
Gian-Carl Casa, who heads the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance, which represents group homes, said, “We’re relieved that a strike has been averted.”
But Casa added, “The fact remains that nonprofits of all types have problems attracting and retaining staff” and that the ultimate success of any state agreement with the union hinges on proper funding of human services. 
Both nursing homes and nonprofit social service agencies have struggled for more than a decade with state payments that haven’t kept pace with inflation.
And while state government has run up huge surpluses in the past seven years — an annual average of $1.8 billion, and is on pace for a $2.4 billion cushion equal to 10% of the General Fund this year — controversial budget caps limit investments in human services, education, early childhood development, municipal aid and other core programs.
Some legislators have said they expect that any agreement with the health care workers’ union would offer limited funding next fiscal year, which begins July 1, and then include greater funding two years out or later.
The upcoming fiscal year will be Connecticut’s first since 2021 that the state did not have access to billions of dollars in emergency federal pandemic aid — resources it could spend outside of budget caps to supplement core programs.
Further complicating matters, additional state investments in nursing and group homes can’t be focused solely on facilities with unionized staff. Many homes employ non-union staff.
The nursing home industry has challenged the legalities of past proposals to focus funds disproportionately.
“Nursing home operators will need to learn more about any proposal that would include any feature favoring compensation and benefits to union employees versus non-union employees,” Barrett added. “It is a well-settled issue that providing public Medicaid dollars to benefit only unionized employees is discriminatory on its face and violates federal law, and this would put hundreds of millions of Connecticut’s Medicaid resources at risk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GROUP-HOMES-STRIKE-0515-SR-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerWINOOSKI — Members of the teachers’ union have called for the removal of a Winooski High School principal, citing a recent staff survey and vote of no confidence.Ninety percent of the licensed staff at the high school participated in a survey conducted by the Winooski Education Association and voted 29-2 indicating a lack of trust in Co-Principal Jean Berthiaume’s leadership, according to union leaders.Two union leaders announced the survey and the subsequent vote of no confidence at the May 14 school board meeting and demanded “drastic action.”The survey data does not represent “a passing discomfort” or “a vocal minority,” said John McKelvy, secretary of the Winooski Education Association, reading from a prepared statement on behalf of Jacie Barber, the union president. “Rather, they respond to ever unfolding transgressions, a deterioration of trust and an undermining of systems.”The overwhelming vote further indicates that the relationship between Berthiaume and the high school staff is “irrevocably broken,” he added, in a way that “no amount of restructuring, reassignment of duties or new titles” can fix.The survey was supported by the Vermont-National Education Association. Data was collected anonymously, and questions were modeled on the state Agency of Education standards by which the principal is evaluated, said Annie Schneider, vice president of the Winooski Education Association, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of the high school staff.When presented with this data, she said members said the only way forward is for Berthiaume to be removed as the high school principal. She said staff members responded firmly in the negative to the question: Do you have confidence that Jean Berthiaume can be an effective leader of Winooski High School?“Today I’m telling you very clearly that this vote represents the voices of the overwhelming majority — 29-2 is definitive. We have no confidence in our administrator and our ask is that he no longer works here,” Schneider said, reading from a prepared statement. “We are not here to cause unnecessary harm or pain to our principal, but he has caused harm to our staff and our school, and we are asking you, the board, to step in and help rectify the situation.” Union leaders did not present the full survey and declined to comment beyond the statements read at the meeting. They said in their speeches the union first raised concerns with former superintendent Sean McMannon in June 2022, but they were never addressed. McMannon did not respond to an email seeking comment.The two statements read at the meeting also spoke of continued issues, including low morale, challenging working conditions, a breakdown of systems and negative outcomes for students and staff.Berthiaume, who was recognized by the Vermont Principals’ Association as one of the 2024-25 school leaders of the year, said in an email to VTDigger this week that he was “surprised and blindsided by this vote, especially given the lack of any substantive concerns or feedback tied directly to my job performance.”Berthiaume was previously principal at Fayston Elementary School and associate principal at Harwood Union Middle School and High School. He was hired in Winooski in July 2019 and draws a salary of $127,920, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria.As co-principal at Winooski Middle and High School, Berthiaume shares the position with Kate Grodin. Grodin did not respond to a request for comment.Robert Millar, chair of the six-member Winooski School Board, read a statement at the meeting submitted by high school teacher Ben Patrick in support of Berthiaume’s leadership. Patrick’s letter called Berthiaume “a skilled, compassionate and versatile administrator” and “an invaluable resource and advocate for students.” He alleged “a counterproductive herd mentality” led to the survey and vote, and he urged the board to be “wary” of charges made against the principal.For years Winooski has struggled with unmet critical learning goals, and Patrick’s letter stated he has seen how that frustration has often been unfairly directed at the administration.“We share a collective responsibility for our inability to fully prepare students for life after high school, and blaming one individual for these systemic challenges is a misdirection,” the letter stated.Chavarria wrote in an email to VTDigger he is unable to comment on personnel issues. He shared the two statements submitted by the union to the School Board. The School Board, via a brief emailed statement, said they appreciate staff feedback but made clear that it is the superintendent who is responsible for the hiring and evaluation of administrative roles in the school system. The three-sentence statement does not address the vote nor the union’s demand. It ends saying, “The Board is confident that all policies and procedures have been followed appropriately to date.”In his email, Chavarria urged the matter be handled with “care and consideration.”“They are all my staff, teachers and admin and they all work so hard,” he wrote.Berthiaume wrote in his email, “Leadership requires making tough decisions, many of which are not always popular in the short term. Still, I am proud and stand by the progress we’ve made. There are clear indicators of success in our students’ experiences and outcomes, and I remain committed to the work ahead.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Winooski teachers’ union calls for removal of high school principal, citing no-confidence vote.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Winooski-High-School-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley shared Friday that the new immigration enforcement agreement he aims to enter into with federal authorities is the same type Gov. Larry Rhoden aims for, but said his agents will only use that authority in limited circumstances.
The agreements let officials trained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ask people about their immigration status and make warrantless arrests for suspected violations.
Jackley’s requested agreement between ICE and the state Division of Criminal Investigation is limited in scope, however, he said in a Friday press release. 
 “To be clear, I am restricting the use of this federal authority to violent criminals and drug dealers,” Jackley said. 
Governor, attorney general visit the border and seek a bigger immigration enforcement role

Jackley first announced his intent to pursue the agreement during a news conference this week with Republican attorneys general at the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, the type of agreement was not specified.
The news came via the release of Jackley’s proposed agreement, which operates under Jackley’s direction. ICE had not yet signed the shared agreement signed stateside byDCI Director Dan Satterlee.
ICE offers three types of agreements under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  One, the Jail Enforcement Model, lets trained jailers ask those in their custody about their immigration status, and lets those jailers search ICE databases and issue immigration detention orders.  
Another trains local jail staff as ICE Warrant Service Officers, allowing  them to serve  immigration warrants obtained from a judge by ICE officers to inmates already in local custody. Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead and Hughes County Sheriff Patrick Callahan both made those types of agreements earlier this spring. 
The third type of agreement offers the broadest scope of authority to local officers. The Task Force Model trains locals who work outside detention centers to act as limited immigration agents, enabling them to ask those they encounter in the normal course of police business about their immigration status, and to arrest them if they’re suspected of violating immigration law. The Obama administration discontinued the type in 2012 due to concerns about racial profiling and civil rights violations. They were revived by the Trump administration earlier this year.
Jackley and Rhoden, both Republicans and potential 2026 gubernatorial candidates, have characterized their support for the agreements as moves showing them to be in lockstep with President Trump’s immigration policies.
While Jackley said in a press release that his agents would use their immigration enforcement authority in limited situations, Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms would not expand upon the scenarios under which state troopers would use their authority once an agreement is in place for the highway patrol.
Taneeza Islam, CEO of South Dakota Voices for Peace, said the general message will make victims of labor and sex trafficking less likely to come forward, and lets perpetrators threaten to turn their victims in for deportation if they attempt to flee.
“You have legal protections if you come forward, but victims don’t know that,” Islam said.  
ICE has authority and supervision over all immigration-related activities, according to Jackley’s agreement. Authorities must undergo ICE-led training and pass federal exams. ICE covers training-related travel costs and provides instructors and materials.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Drought is starting to creep back into Utah on the heels of an average winter, with long-term forecasts pointing to an abnormally hot summer. 
According to the three month seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service, the Beehive State is expected to have above average temperatures through August. Meanwhile, the service says it’s unclear whether there will be above or below average precipitation this summer — according to its models, there’s an equal chance of both. 
“Hotter doesn’t always mean drier. We are right now showing for most of the state at about equal chances of average precipitation,” said Joel Williams, deputy director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, speaking to lawmakers earlier this week.

Those three month outlooks are not an exact science — but they do come amid increasingly bleak water conditions for much of the state. Despite an average snow year for northern Utah, the southern regions had a “dismal” winter, Williams said. 
The snowpack for some basins in the southwest veered into unprecedented territory this winter and according to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, much of southern Utah remained below 45% of normal moisture. 
And across the state, drought is starting to rear its head again after two good years. This time last year, about 25% of the state was considered abnormally dry, while just 0.2% was in moderate drought — now, 39% of Utah is in severe drought, with 3% in extreme drought, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Just the high elevation areas of Utah, Salt Lake, Wasatch, Summit and Morgan counties, and a sliver of Box Elder County, are in the clear. The rest of the state is facing at least abnormally dry conditions. 
Most of Washington County is in extreme drought, extending into parts of Iron County. And Tooele, Juab, Millard, Beaver, Iron, Kane, Garfield, San Juan, Grand and Uintah counties all have areas in severe drought. 
“The last two years of above average snowpack helped us but now we’re starting to see the drought creep back in. And as we say in Utah, we’re either in drought or preparing for the next one,” Williams said. 
Those conditions led Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to issue a drought-related emergency declaration, giving farmers in the state access to low-interest loans to help weather the dry conditions. 
Eligible farmers can apply for seven-year loans of up to $100,000 each, with two years of no interest and 2.75% interest thereafter, according to the department. Applications for the loans will be accepted until Oct. 23. 
The good news, Williams said, is Utah’s reservoirs are in healthy shape. Across the state, reservoir levels are about 20% higher than normal, with nearly every reservoir in northern Utah above 80% capacity. Utah Lake, Strawberry, Jordanelle, Deer Creek, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Pineview and Starvation reservoirs are all around 95% or higher. 
“Those full reservoirs that we have, those could really help us if we’re heading into another drought,” said Williams.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050725_Provo-River-Delta_16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

Gretchen Whitmer's Fiscal year 2026 budget recommendations on Feb. 19, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonDownsizing and mass job cuts put forth by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have already hampered public health officials in Michigan, Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel declared in court filings earlier this month.
Kennedy announced in March that his department would be working to eliminate 20,000 total employees, consolidating DHHS’s 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its regional offices. 
However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and 19 other attorneys general took action, arguing these cuts would functionally dismantle the DHHS, leaving it unable to do its job, with Nessel warning the decision could bring “immeasurable harm” to the nation and healthcare if the courts do not step in. 
A federal judge has since blocked the Trump Administration from issuing further job cuts and reorganizing the Executive Department until a lawsuit brought by a collection of government workers’ and healthcare workers unions is resolved.
As part of these cuts, the DHHS is eliminating roughly 3,500 employees at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control, 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health and 300 at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

HHS Dismantling_Hertel Decl as filed_5.9.25 
In a declaration filed as part of the case, Hertel detailed how the reduction of staff and closure of several labs at the CDC alongside cuts at the FDA are hindering the state’s work on disease testing, public health and tobacco monitoring. 
While the Michigan Department of Health and Human services runs its own Bureau of Laboratories, which is enmeshed with labs operated by the CDC and other states’ public health agencies, the CDC’s lab closures and staffing cuts have left states to fill the gaps. 
The Bureau was directly impacted by the closure of the CDC Viral Hepatitis Laboratory Branch and its discontinuation of hepatitis testing, and according to Hertel has not received consistent communication from the CDC about test discontinuations.
“As a result of sporadic changes to test offerings by CDC laboratories, the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories has been unable to determine which tests to prioritize with confidence,” Hertel said.
MDHHS also expects to see higher levels of test submissions for Hepatitis C due to the CDC’s decision to discontinue testing.
“The MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories serves as the National HIV and Hepatitis C virus NAT Reference Center in cooperation with the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories… if MDHHS shifts its lab capacity to Hepatitis C testing, the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories staff will have less capacity to respond to other public health emergencies,” Hertel warned. 
The department has also felt a lack of central coordination on tests discontinued by the CDC, Hertel said, noting that if the national agency is not at full capacity, there won’t be a central coordinating agency for responding to disease outbreaks. 
Bureau of Laboratories staff have also reported difficulties contacting CDC staff, Hertel said.

In addition to its impacts on lab testing, DHHS cuts have also significantly impacted the state-level department’s work on public health, with Hertel noting that the state relies on a partnership with several CDC programs for infectious disease detection and response activities. As a result, MDHHS staff say communications with CDC subject matter experts is now slow, reduced, or sometimes non-existent.
Because key program staff are no longer with the CDC, there has also been confusion on points of contact and a reduced knowledge base, Hertel said. 
“As a result, the CDC has failed to provide timely response to inquiries of urgent nature, reduced or eliminated national calls, and can no longer effectively serve as a national coordinator of infectious diseases efforts,” she said.
As an example, Hertel pointed to reports from her staff that the CDC is no longer sending out-of-state travel notifications about potential disease exposures to Michigan residents, including notices for diseases with critical timelines, like measles. Staff reported that the CDC was not able to coordinate a recent multi-state effort to investigate a complex and urgent case of human rabies, and is no longer hosting 50-state calls on the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza response, despite ongoing concerns of a global bird flu outbreak.
“ Overall, the mass termination of CDC personnel appears to have created a climate of fear for remaining staff, thereby undermining the ability of remaining CDC staff to effectively carry out their jobs by supporting state health departments like MDHHS,” Hertel said. 
These cuts have similarly left MDHHS without access to updated health data and data systems needed to identify emerging health crises and address disparities in healthcare, Hertel said. 
Cuts at the CDC have also bled into state-level efforts in preventing HIV, AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. 
The CDC has also cut the entirety of its Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System team and shut down the program’s data collection system. While Michigan was able to retrieve its 2024 data before the system shutdown, the CDC’s team would normally statistically weight that data, meaning the unweighted data obtained by the state is unusable. 
“To use the data, MDHHS would be required to contract with a survey statistician to properly weight this data, expending significant resources that would otherwise have been available from CDC staff,” Hertel said. 
The CDC also assists the state in monitoring and responding to lead poisoning in children, Hertel said. However, following significant cuts at the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, the MDHHS Environmental Health Bureau has received zero communication from the program. 
While the CDC previously sent notices about newly identified food and consumer products containing lead, those notices have stopped, Hertel said. 
MDHHS has similarly experienced issues in its environmental public health efforts including less frequent communications, the end of public health programming work groups with other states, and limited and inconsistent guidance from the CDC leaving the CDC Tracking Data Explorer without updated state-level data on drinking water, biomonitoring and radon.
While the CDC also helps the state administer several chronic disease and injury control programs, significant staffing shortages and the loss or potential loss of CDC contracts has left MDHHS with little or no guidance, Hertel said, creating uncertainty regarding the future of these programs.
The MDHHS Division of Child and Adolescent Health has also been impacted, Hertel said, with the Administration for Children and Families indefinitely postponing annual training for Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) teen pregnancy prevention grantees.
Hertel also pointed to the effectively shuttering of  the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health as a major loss, noting the important role it played in preventing and reducing cigarette use by collecting and sharing information on smoking and its health impacts, including state level data on tobacco-use cessation treatments and high-quality reports on tobacco use trends. 
She also noted the loss of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, which was effectively shuttered when all members of its staff were terminated on April 1.
“Among other duties, [the Center for Tobacco Products] conducted compliance checks on vendors and retailers to ensure that tobacco products are not sold to those under the age of twenty-one, reviewed premarket applications for new tobacco products before they can be marketed in the United States, enforced advertising and promotion restrictions, and educated the public about the risks of tobacco use including the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products,” Hertel explained, later noting the state relied on both the Center for Tobacco Products and and the Office on Smoking and Health for its Tobacco programs. 
If Michigan does not receive support and funds from the Office on Smoking and Health, it stands to lose $2,347,639 in grant funding and other resources, Hertel said. Most of that funding supports Michigan Quitlink, which provides services to all Michigan residents for tobacco dependence treatment at a cost of just over $1.2 million annually. It also supports efforts to prevent youth tobacco use, offer healthcare provider training on tobacco dependence treatment and offer improved resources for schools to address vaping.
A loss of support from the Center for Tobacco Products could also shutter the state’s program ensuring retailers comply with laws banning the sale of tobacco products to underaged customers, as it has been unable to approve and process MDHHS’s request for additional funds to remain fully operational during a 2-month contract extension, or issue a solicitation for new state funding. 
If the state program is shuttered, eight full time staff members would be laid off and $1.485 million dollars would be lost annually, Hertel said.
An MDDHS spokesperson declined a followup interview on Hertel’s behalf.

,DC,2025-05-23 19:51:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-3-million-people-would-lose-snap-benefits-under-gop-bill-nonpartisan-report-says,,"The massive tax and spending bill passed by U.S. House Republicans would likely result in 3.2 million people losing food assistance benefits, and saddle states with around $14 billion a year in costs, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Democrats have argued the bill, which the House passed, 215-214 early Thursday without any Democrats in support, would cut programs for the needy to fund tax breaks for high earners.The CBO document, issued late Thursday, responded to a request to the office from the top Democrats on the Senate and House Agriculture committees, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Angie Craig, both of Minnesota, and somewhat bolsters that claim. The panels oversee federal food aid programs.“This report is truly devastating,” Craig said in a Friday statement to States Newsroom. “As a mother and someone who at times relied on food assistance as a child, these numbers are heartbreaking. It is infuriating that Republicans in Congress are willing to make our children go hungry so they can give tax breaks to the already rich.”A provision in the bill to tighten work requirements, including by excluding single parents of children older than 6 and by raising the age of adults to whom the work requirements apply, of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would result in 3.2 million people losing access to the program in an average month, the CBO report said.Of those, 1.4 million would be people who currently have a state waiver from work requirements that would be disallowed under the bill and 800,000 would be adults who live with children 7 or older, the report said.Republicans want to use the legislative package to extend the 2017 tax law and its cuts, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.Toll on statesThe cost-share changes, which would require states for the first time to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits, would also limit participation and add a massive line item to state budgets, according to the CBO.Starting in 2028, states would be responsible for paying 5% to 25% of SNAP benefits, with a state’s share rising with its payment error rate. The federal government currently pays for all SNAP benefits.Under the House bill, which will likely undergo substantial changes as the Senate considers it in the coming weeks, states collectively would be responsible for just less than $100 billion from 2028 to 2034, about $14 billion per year.States would respond in a variety of ways, CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote, including potentially dropping out of the program.“CBO expects that some states would maintain current benefits and eligibility and others would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs,” he wrote.The office took a “probabilistic approach to account for a range of possible outcomes” to determine what the effect on households would be and estimated that 1.3 million people would lose benefits because of state responses to the new cost-share.CBO’s forecasters determined the impacts of the work requirements and cost-share provisions separately, meaning some people potentially losing benefits could have been counted in both categories.Move to the SenateThe House vote Thursday sent the measure to the Senate, where the debate over SNAP benefits may fall along similar party lines.Republicans who hold control in that chamber are planning to employ the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to skirt the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement for legislation.During the House Agriculture Committee’s debate over its portion of the legislation, Republicans on the panel said the work requirement and state cost-share measures were needed reforms to SNAP that would protect the program for those it was meant to serve, while limiting the costs associated with benefits to adults who were able and unwilling to work or in the country illegally.In a Friday statement, Sara Lasure, a spokeswoman for Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, also said the panel would seek reforms to the program but did not offer specifics.“The Senate Agriculture Committee is in the process of crafting its budget reconciliation package and will work as good stewards of taxpayer dollars to make commonsense reforms to SNAP that encourage employment,” she wrote in an email.Klobuchar, in a statement after House passage Thursday, blasted the House bill and indicated she would oppose efforts to cut SNAP benefits.“House Republicans are pulling the rug out from under millions of families by taking away federal assistance to put food on the table,” she said. “They’re doing that even as President Trump’s tariff taxes raise food prices by more than $200 for the average family, all to fund more tax breaks for the wealthy. That’s so very wrong —and we will fight against it in the Senate.”",,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill that would eliminate certain transgender protections established by a 2018 anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire was approved by the state Senate Thursday and now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
​​If it becomes law, House Bill 148, which was sponsored by Wilton Republican Rep. Jim Kofalt, will allow businesses and organizations in New Hampshire to classify certain services, such as locker rooms and restrooms, by biological sex. It would also permit schools and organized sports teams in the state to keep transgender athletes off teams that are consistent with their gender identity. It would allow prisons, mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers to place transgender people with members of their at-birth sex even if they ask to be placed according to the gender they identify with. The bill doesn’t require any of these things, but it allows whoever owns the restrooms, administers the sports teams, or runs the prison to do so without facing discrimination charges. This reverses parts of 2018’s Law Against Discrimination, which was enacted to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, or national origin.”
The Senate passed the bill, 16-8, along party lines Thursday, with all Republicans voting yes and all Democrats voting no. The House passed the legislation, 201-166, in March. Only two Democratic House members, Reps. Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, both of Peterborough, voted in favor.
Ayotte will now have the option to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature. Her predecessor, former Gov. Chris Sununu, was given the same options in 2024 when the House and Senate approved House Bill 396. This year’s bill, HB 148, is a word-for-word copy of last year’s HB 396. Sununu ultimately vetoed the bill, calling it “unacceptable,” and saying it “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves,” per his veto message.
LGBTQ+ rights supporters sang outside the State House restrooms in protest of the bill during the Senate session Thursday.

(Screenshot from Iowa PBS video)Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday that eliminating Iowa’s income tax may not be on the table before she leaves office — but that she plans to focus on reducing property taxes in the 2026 legislative session.
In her public statement following the adjournment of the 2025 legislative session, Reynolds did not bring up income taxes as a goal for 2026. Instead, she highlighted her plans to work on “reducing Iowans’ property tax burden” next year.
During an interview on “Iowa Press,” moderator Kay Henderson of Radio Iowa asked Reynolds if she had abandoned the goal to end Iowa’s income tax or planned to move on cutting both income and property taxes in 2026. Reynolds said, “that would be aggressive.”

“I want to create a foundation that when I do leave, the next Republican governor that sits in that chair will be able to continue to reduce the individual income tax rate,” Reynolds said. “But I do need to focus on property taxes. That is what we hear about all the time.”
Reynolds announced in April she will not seek reelection in the 2026 general election. During her tenure as governor, Reynolds has put a major focus on cutting taxes, particularly focusing on Iowa’s income taxes. Iowa’s individual income tax rate fell to a flat 3.8% rate in January following a law the governor signed in 2024 that sped up 2022 cuts to individual and corporate income taxes.
While Reynolds has celebrated these reductions, she has also said in previous years that she wanted to go further and completely eliminate the state’s income tax. At a Cato Institute forum in 2023, Reynolds said her goal was to “get to zero individual income tax rate by the end of this second term.”
The governor said in 2025, legislators had “asked to take the lead” on property taxes, but that she planned to be more involved in this work and finding a solution to reduce property tax costs through discussions with local governments and other stakeholders over the summer.
Republican legislative leaders, Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, the Ways and Means Committee chairs in the Senate and House, had introduced a bill in 2025 to eliminate Iowa’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes and instead move to a “revenue-restricted” system that would limit most property tax levy rates to 2% growth each year. The proposal, which went through multiple iterations but failed to come to a floor vote, also included other measures intended to lower property taxes like a shift of $426 million in K-12 funding from property taxes to the state.
Reynolds said she did not believe that shifting funding to the state necessarily would be the correct solution, as “it’s still taxpayer dollars” that would come from state taxes instead of local property taxes to back this K-12 funding. She said her focus on putting together a package to cut property taxes would involve looking at “how we deliver services to our citizens.”
She said it’s not feasible for Iowa communities to have “level of government that we have and expect the property taxes to go lower.” She said her discussions will involve ways Iowa can streamline government to cut costs, but will also likely involve changes to how Iowa local governments have operated in the past 40 years.
“It’s disruptive, but that means people are going to probably be a little uncomfortable, and we’ll have the conversation,” Reynolds said. “And I’m not going to wait until January to have it. We’re going to have it all summer as we’re working on it.”
Most of the governor’s priorities, which she laid out during her Condition of the State address in January, were met before the 2025 session ended earlier this month. Measures like restricting cellphone use in classrooms, increasing medical residency slots and making changes to Iowa’s rural health care system and backfilling some natural disaster aid for Iowa areas impacted by 2024 extreme weather all passed this session.
Disaster aid
When asked by moderators about the proposed elimination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the federal agency that played a large role in Iowa’s recovery efforts after the 2024 natural disasters, Reynolds said there still needs to “be a partnership” with the federal government but that she sees areas for improvement in FEMA’s response system.
“I’m telling you, it takes way too long, it’s way too bureaucratic,” Reynolds said. “You know, we’ve got people on the ground that can act quickly. We were able to stand up some really unique programs because they gave us the flexibility to do that. That’s what states do, that’s what we could do. So I think it really is something we need to take a look at.”
Child care
Some of Reynolds’ proposals, like measures on child care infrastructure and energy programs, did not make it to her desk.
The child care bill included a provision to shift funding from the existing Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds to a new $16 million grant pilot program for preschool providers and child care centers. The focus would be on providing full-day care for children. 
Though the legislation did not pass this session, Reynolds moved forward Tuesday to establish a Continuum of Care grant with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services releasing an initial Request for Proposal for the grant. The governor also extended the child care assistance pilot program, allowing child care workers to receive child care assistance for their own children.
Carbon pipelines
One bill that Reynolds has not weighed in on is House File 639, the legislation proposing multiple changes related to the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects. The bill passed the Senate following heated debate during the last week of session. Republican leaders in the House, including House Speaker Pat Grassley, have said they believe Reynolds will sign the bill into law despite opposition from the ethanol industry and some high-profile Republicans.
June 14 is the deadline for Reynolds to sign bills from the 2025 session into law; if she does not sign or veto a bill by this deadline, it is considered a “pocket veto” and not enacted. The governor said on “Iowa Press” she is meeting with stakeholders to discuss the legislation, but is still in the process of researching and considering the impacts of the bill with her policy team and with advocates both for and against the measure.
“Almost every meeting has led to some additional research on my team, I have legal counsel looking at it,” Reynolds said. “So it’s been a really good process, and we’re going to continue that through at least the next week. So I want to make sure that I have given individual stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in, so that I can, again, make make the best, informed decision that I can based on information I’ve heard.”

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers are seeking to extend lawsuit protections to regular news reports following a recent ruling by the state’s Supreme Court that allowed a defamation suit against the Chicago Sun-Times to progress.

The measure, Senate Bill 1181, would explicitly name the press in an existing state law that aims to protect against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” otherwise known as SLAPP lawsuits.

The case that inspired the legislation was brought against the Sun-Times after the paper published multiple articles about investigations into the former executive director of the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board.

The Sun-Times had obtained a copy of a complaint made to the Office of the Executive Inspector General against Mauro Glorioso, a former chair of PTAB who later became its executive director.

The complaint, which has since been ruled unfounded by the OEIG, claimed that Glorioso, a Republican, told staff “he wanted a large reduction in the assessment of Trump Tower because the owner of the property was the president of the United States.”

Staff at PTAB had not initially recommended reducing property taxes but ultimately altered their decision to recommend a $1 million reduction. An administrative judge later said that decision was made to rectify an overassessment that occurred in 2011, and the recommendation to reduce the assessment was upheld by an appellate court in 2023.

Glorioso sued the newspaper in 2021, claiming he was defamed and that the paper’s coverage mischaracterized the OEIG investigation, misstated Glorioso’s motivation as political and overstated his involvement in the decision.

Lawyers from the Chicago Sun-Times sought dismissal under the 2007 Citizen Participation Act that defines a SLAPP suit as frivolous litigation that “chills and diminishes citizen participation in government.”

More than three years after Glorioso initially filed his suit, the court ruled in November that the Sun-Times’ articles weren’t investigations, which would have been protected under the law. Instead, the court wrote, the articles were news reports about something a government agency was doing and lacked any intent to elicit action or a solution from the government – which was needed for SLAPP protections to be applicable.

The court’s opinion also said there wasn’t any mention of the press or news media in the act, so they allowed the lawsuit to continue at the lower court level.

“This is not to minimize or understate the importance of the press and other news media in our democracy,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion. “Our jurisprudence is replete with privileges and other protections designed to protect these concerns, many of which remain at issue in this lawsuit. We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern.”

SB 1181 directly addresses that sentiment. The bill states, “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so would be protected under the law if the bill passes.

The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case, including discovery, would be stayed while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.

Rep. Dan Ugaste, R-Geneva, voiced concerns on the House floor about that provision.

“I believe we're going to have a unintended impact of actually harming individuals who are just trying to protect themselves from what could be very irresponsible journalism, all under the guise of protecting the constitutional right of the freedom of the press,” Ugaste said before he urged a “no” vote.

Rep. Dan Didech, D-Buffalo Grove, explained the reasoning behind the provision.

“We are amending the statute so there still has to be a nexus to that exercise of constitutional rights, but the conduct does not have to be solely related to that exercise,” Didech said.

The bill cleared the Senate 55-1 in April and passed the House with a minor amendment on a vote of 75-38. Because of the amendment, it heads back to the Senate before it can be sent to the governor.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY – The head of the financially troubled state mental health agency is accusing Oklahoma’s attorney general of misusing his office and bullying after he posted copies of her tax liens on social media.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond posted on X that the Oklahoma Tax Commission had placed three liens on Allie Friesen’s property for “thousands in unpaid taxes.” 
He wrote Friesen’s most recent lien was released the same day she was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt to lead the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.
“How can we expect a taxpayer who doesn’t properly handle their own personal finances to be in charge of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars?” he wrote. “Gov. Stitt needs to stop protecting Allie Friesen and start protecting our tax dollars.”
In response, Friesen, the state’s mental health commissioner, sent her staff an email saying the liens were paid off  “long ago” and do not reflect her ability to lead.
“To be very clear: this is a non-issue being weaponized for political gain,” she wrote. “What is an issue – and one I cannot ignore – is the blatant violation of character, the disturbing misuse of public office, and the sustained campaign of political bullying I have endured at the hands of the Attorney General of our state.”
Drummond has called on Stitt to fire Friesen amid reports of financial disarray at the mental health department, cut or canceled provider contracts and warnings that the agency would not be able to pay nearly 2,000 employees without an emergency legislative appropriation. 
Stitt appointed Friesen to the post in January 2024 after his prior appointee resigned.
Friesen wrote in her email that  Drummond was angry with her after she removed him from a position of influence. 
Friesen terminated his office’s representation of the agency in a class action lawsuit which accused the state of failing to provide competency restoration services to indigent criminal defendants.
Drummond backed settling it, but Friesen and Stitt initially opposed the agreement. They later agreed to settle it. 
Stitt has maintained support for Friesen.
Drummond said Friday his interactions with Friesen pertaining to the mental health litigation forced him to conclude “that, unfortunately, she is not competent for the position with which she has been tasked.” 
“Even before the escalation of scandals surrounding her leadership, she had shown herself not to be up to the job. It gives me no pleasure to say that, but it’s the truth,” Drummond said Friday. 
Maria Chaverri, a Friesen spokesperson, confirmed that Friesen had sent the email to staff. She said Friesen’s family had fulfilled all tax obligations.
She did not respond to questions about the dollar amount of the liens and years for the back taxes.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has been the subject of audits, legislative inquiries and investigations after it was revealed the agency had a significant budget shortfall, which Friesen blamed on prior administrations.
A recent audit by State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said the agency needed $28.7 million in emergency funding to make it through the current budget year.
“It needs a director with executive managerial experience and a mastery of basic budgetary and compliance skills,” Byrd said in a statement when she released the audit.

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Friday responded to accusations that her office was stonewalling the Republican-controlled Michigan House Oversight Committee this week, saying the committee’s member statements were inaccurate and misinformed.
Nessel in a letter highlighted the fact that she has been in constant communication with the committee and its chair, Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), and that she agreed to provide the full scope of the litigation expenses from her term and her predecessor’s. Although DeBoyer and his fellow Republicans threw barbs this week after only getting half of what was requested, Nessel said she needs additional time to produce the remaining documents.
Those documents that were handed over were also shared with members of the Michigan Capitol press corps, which was another area of frustration for House Republicans.
“By June 17, as committed, we will, likewise, share the second production with the chair and our Capitol press corps to ensure transparency,” Nessel said. “It has always been my belief that these documents and the evidence belong to the people, as allowed for under Michigan law, and I have committed to nothing less since the close of my department’s prosecutions.”

Nessel Letter 5.23.25 
The request revolves around the Flint water criminal prosecution that resulted in zero convictions after the cases were dismissed, but not before the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution team violated the due process rights of the defendants by indicting them using a one-man grand jury.
The move disallowed several members of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration – who were accused of negligence that fueled a state-created danger – from having a preliminary examination that would have given them a chance to poke holes in the state’s probable cause arguments. Snyder’s associates were charged with felonies, but Snyder was only charged with a misdemeanor before all charges were dismissed.
The prosecution team was led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, while Nessel spearheaded the civil litigation side of the Flint crisis, which resulted in a mammoth settlement.
When Republicans took back control of the Michigan House of Representatives this year, Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government, requested contracts, invoices, itemized lists of billable hours, memoranda of understanding with third-party entities and other financial items related to the investigation and prosecution that occurred under Nessel’s regime.
Her predecessor, former Attorney General Bill Schuette, led an investigation and began a prosecution of his own by employing a special counsel, attorney Todd Flood. That investigation remained active when Nessel became attorney general in 2018, but Nessel soon after dissolved Schuette’s case and began anew with her own investigation.
Although Rigas had asked pretty pointedly for documents related to Nessel’s time as attorney general, the department said it would endeavor to show the whole scope of the cost of the prosecution, which included Schuette’s tenure.
Those documents would take time to process and deliver to Rigas’ subcommittee, Nessel said from the outset, and requested an extension of the initial March 25 deadline. That deadline was Tuesday. Nessel delivered a document package on a secured hard drive on Wednesday.
But the documents delivered only covered Schuette’s term, and Nessel stated that the remaining document haul would take about another four weeks to produce.
The continued back and forth angered Rigas, who called Nessel’s office onto the carpet.
On Thursday evening, DeBoyer sent Nessel’s office a letter demanding production of the remaining documents.
“Most, if not all, of those records appear to be Verizon cell phone bills related to Todd Flood,” DeBoyer wrote. “Your office failed to produce any documents from your own tenure as attorney general. It is apparent that you and your office willfully refused to provide documentation relative to your own tenure in office and instead spent your time digging up irrelevant documents from a prior administration.”
DeBoyer demanded that the documents be presented no later than noon on May 30, and delivered electronically – and presumably not on a password protected drive.

DeBoyer Letter 5-22-25 
In response, Nessel said she was transparent with Rigas and agreed to deliver documentation from 2016 [when Schuette was still in office] to the close of the Nessel era prosecution in 2023.
“As requested, this includes documents from the prior administration, which began the prosecutions,” Nessel wrote in a letter to DeBoyer issued Friday. “I was also clear that this involved thousands of pages of documents, which would take some time to produce and require redirection of staff efforts to fulfill.”
Nessel also said she provided Rigas and DeBoyer with a link to a publicly available website including all costs incurred by the state in the matter. She provided that link again in her letter to DeBoyer.
“If you were not provided this information previously, you have it now,” Nessel wrote. “Also, despite your and Rep. Rigas’ claims, yesterday’s production included 28 megabytes of documents which satisfies the requested first and third categories through 2019, with the commitment to provide 2019-2023 by June 17.”
Nessel did not appear to budge from her position that the documents would be delivered by June 17, seemingly bucking DeBoyer’s new request for production by May 30.
Nessel said that there were no settlements or cost recoveries related to the prosecutions, so there was nothing to provide the committee or Rigas’ subcommittee in that regard.
The attorney general added that the documents her office turned over were not mere cell phone bills.
“In total, my department delivered over 450 documents, separated into subfolders under the headings, ‘invoices,’ and ‘contracts,’ to help navigate this extensive production,” Nessel wrote. “Billable hours for outside counsel, expense forms, associated costs and more are all itemized throughout those documents. If you had reviewed the entire production, you would see it was far more extensive than simply Verizon cell phone bills from one attorney.”

The case was dismissed on Thursday. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge cleared the way Thursday for CoreCivic to reopen its Leavenworth prison as an immigration detention center, saying he lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.
“We need to confer with our attorneys,” said Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager. “We will probably discuss it with the city commission sometime next week.”
Peterson said he didn’t know whether further court action could occur before June 1, when CoreCivic officials had indicated they may begin receiving detainees.
“We may have further negotiations with CoreCivic themselves about this,” Peterson said.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case, saying the city failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. During a Tuesday hearing, Crouse repeatedly questioned whether he had any basis to act, saying the city had not adequately outlined that issue.
Crouse, appointed to the bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump, highlighted two pending motions before him, including Leavenworth’s request for an injunction that would have stopped CoreCivic from reopening until it could be determined whether the company had to go through the city’s development process. CoreCivic had asked for a dismissal of the case.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said in court Tuesday that CoreCivic had agreed not to take detainees until June 1 while the case was decided.
After the hearing, Hatley said in an interview there were concerns that if detainees were housed in the prison before the legal disputes were resolved, the federal government could refuse to move the detainees regardless of the outcome of the case.
“The City asserts that Core Civic should be enjoined from operating its detention facility without the proper permit,” Crouse wrote in his ruling Thursday. “But it has not pled facts to establish that subject-matter jurisdiction exists in federal court to consider that claim. Accordingly, this action is dismissed, and the parties’ motions are denied as moot.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company was pleased with the decision.
“We remain focused on ensuring the Midwest Regional Reception Center is prepared to meet the needs of our federal partner,” he said.
Gustin did not answer questions about whether CoreCivic intended to begin housing ICE detainees in June.
 Move forward

Activists who have spoken out against reopening the facility are hopeful the city will appeal.
“We hope the city will explore all of its options as the concerns of the lawsuit since its filing in February — CoreCivic’s disregard for the city’s governance and its rush to fill the facility without accountability — have only grown more urgent,” Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said in an email.
Tseng also said the judge’s decision held hope with regard to whether CoreCivic would have to follow Leavenworth development codes requiring the company to apply for a special use permit.
“It’s also worth noting that in the dismissal, the court agreed that when CoreCivic ceased operation for 12 months, it lost its non-conforming status and that its initial application for the special use permit appeared to be a recognition of this fact,” she said.
CoreCivic was grandfathered into the city’s development codes when it was open and operating as the Leavenworth Detention Facility from 1992 to 2021. The codes were passed in 2012.
City officials, as laid out in the lawsuit, have told CoreCivic it must apply for a special use permit.
 ‘Great start’

CoreCivic’s reopening of the Leavenworth facility, which closed in 2021 at the end of its federal contract and under numerous accusations of inhuman treatment at the facility, is part of the company’s plan to reopen nine idle facilities.
In its May earnings report, CoreCivic announced total revenue of $488.6 million, with net income of $25.1 million.
“2025 is off to a strong start for CoreCivic. First quarter occupancy in CoreCivic facilities reached 77% of available capacity, an increase from 75.2% in the first quarter of last year,” said CEO Damon T. Hininger in a press release. “Based on cost management and increased bed utilization, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), we exceeded our internal expectations for the first quarter. Additionally, we have begun to re-activate three previously idle facilities under multiple agreements with ICE.”
In Security and Exchange Commission filings, CoreCivic said it had nine idle facilities, including the Leavenworth facility, renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“CoreCivic anticipates additional contracting activity as 2025 progresses,” Hininger said. “In addition to the facilities we are currently activating, we are making preparatory investments in many of our other idle facilities so that they will be available quickly, as our partners’ needs require and as their budgets allow.”
 Leavenworth contract

CoreCivic SEC filings and a press release said they signed a letter of agreement with ICE at the beginning of March to reopen the Leavenworth facility, which would house 1,033 detainees. As a result, ICE paid CoreCivic $5 million with a maximum of $22.6 million set over a six-month period to cover start-up expenses while the two hash out a long-term contract.
In its quarterly report, filed May 8 with the SEC, CoreCivic noted that Leavenworth filed a lawsuit.
“CoreCivic plans to vigorously defend this matter on the basis that the (special use permit) is not applicable under existing statute,” the filing said. “CoreCivic has agreed with the City of Leavenworth to not accept detainees prior to June 1, 2025 while this matter is deliberated. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain a favorable ruling in this matter or that ICE and the Company will ultimately enter into a long-term contract for the utilization of the Company’s Midwest Regional Reception Center.”

In the current two-year budget, which runs through June 30, services offered by the group, called Treehouse, were expanded. But the spending plan Gov. Bob Ferguson signed Tuesday includes cuts that are equal to a third of the group’s overall budget.
Graduation rates for foster children are the lowest among public school students in the state. However, rates increased from 36% to 53% in the past decade, according to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Cuts to the nonprofit could undermine this progress, leaders of the group say. 
Foster children often face high levels of instability and uncertainty, which can include parents with mental health or substance abuse issues. This often contributes to them performing poorly in school when it comes to attendance, grades, test scores and graduation rates, said Dawn Rain, CEO of Treehouse. 
At times, students can change schools multiple times a year. Every time they switch schools, they can lose up to six months of academic progress. 
“I always say it’s really hard to worry about your math test this week if you don’t know if you’re going to see your mom,” Rain said.
Treehouse has two grants from the state. One with the Department of Children, Youth and Families and the other with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
In the current two-year budget, the Legislature allocated funding to support eighth graders in foster care as they transition to high school because the organization was seeing that a large group of students were being lost before they got to ninth grade. 
Confronted with a multibillion-dollar budget deficit over the next four years, the Legislature reduced funding for one Treehouse grant and cut the other entirely. 
The grant from the Department of Children, Youth and Families was reduced from roughly $1.1 million to $660,000 a year. This grant funded educational advisors who worked alongside caseworkers at the department to ensure educational stability for foster children. 
The advisors advocate for students to stay in the same school and help smooth transitions between schools when needed. They also assist with the transfer of education records, class placements and special education access.  
The entire $7 million a year grant from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction was cut. This grant allowed the nonprofit’s advisors to meet weekly with students at school and work on attendance, academics, and behavioral issues to increase graduation rates. 
This staff provided students with social and emotional support and guidance and sometimes became the single, stable adult in a child’s life due to high turnover rates with caseworkers, foster families, and schools. 
Services from Treehouse are available to students in any school district in the state. The organization currently serves between 60% and 70% of foster children in the state and works in almost half of the school districts across Washington. 
While foster students only make up 1% to 2% of the student population, it can be hard for schools to pay close attention to their specific needs. Without support, they are more likely to end up unemployed, in poverty, homeless, or incarcerated.
The loss of funding could lead the nonprofit to scale back services and potentially lay off staff. Funding for the affected programs will run through the rest of this academic year but will stop on July 1, the start of the state’s fiscal year. 
“​​Our students are so highly mobile, they change placements a lot,” Rain said. “When we have services statewide, if a student moves across the state, we can kind of catch them.” 
Staff are located in child welfare offices or in school buildings across the state. Students who work with the organization for more than two years have a graduation rate close to 70%. 
“If we have this limited footprint, some of that is not going to be possible,” Rain said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/education-savings-1-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

[…]","LGBTQ+ advocate Cora Webb was among those who testified at City Hall in Columbia, S.C., Tuesday, May 20, 2025, urging the city to maintain its ban on conversion therapy for minors. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)There’s an old horror story: the call is coming from inside the house. In Columbia, that chilling metaphor might not be far from reality — and this time, it’s not a fictional villain on the line, but the possibility that someone elected to protect the city may have quietly worked to harm it from within.
Tuesday night Columbians of all stripes came out to tell the city: Don’t repeal the ban on licensed healthcare providers giving minors so-called “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that seeks to force a change in sexual orientation or gender identity.
Residents who had been victims of the barbarous practice shared heart-rending stories. Mental health professionals, religious and secular residents, gay and straight alike spoke – all in defense of keeping this important ban in place.
City Council punted on the decision, giving residents and advocates a small reprieve.
After the council meeting, Mayor Daniel Rickenmann told reporters that city leaders had “sequestered” hospitality and accommodations tax funding — bracing for the possibility that the state Legislature would withhold support.
That support, estimated at $3.7 million, now hangs in the balance because an ambitious, socially conservative senator from the Upstate disapproved of Columbia’s policy to protect LGBTQ+ kids.
Acting in the wake of Attorney General Alan Wilson’s letter, that senator inserted language into the Senate’s version of the budget making Columbia’s public funding a hostage to ideological retaliation.
And then a curious thing happened on Wednesday. After the conference committee completed its work of cobbling together the state budget, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Bruce Bannister — speaking about the inclusion of the proviso in their final package — said this about unnamed Columbia City Council members:
“They were supportive of us adopting the proviso … and that this would encourage their members to think a little harder about it.”
When a reporter asked if the mayor specifically talked with them, Bannister said, “I don’t – it was someone. I neither confirm nor deny who was doing the work on that end.”
That silence is deafening. Because if it turns out that any member of Columbia City Council lobbied state lawmakers to deliberately deny the city funds as a backdoor tactic to force the repeal of its ban on conversion therapy, then what we are dealing with is not just an instance of political pressure. It is a civic betrayal of the highest order.
That being said, we can’t lose focus. Columbia’s ordinance banning conversion therapy — a practice condemned by every major medical and psychological association — is a life-affirming law designed to protect LGBTQ+ youth from psychological abuse masquerading as treatment. It took courage for City Council to enact it. Resistance to repealing the ordinance is paramount now more than ever.
However, if now, through backroom dealings and veiled threats, city officials are attempting to reverse that moral stand by threatening a $3.7 million cut to Columbia’s public budget, then they have not only undermined public trust — they have weaponized the state budget against their own citizens and constituents.
That alone would be scandal enough. However, the intrigue doesn’t seem to stop there. What makes it even more audacious is the decision to tie that political coercion to hospitality and accommodations tax (HTAX) funding.
HTAX funding is the fuel behind the festivals that draw visitors from across the Southeast. It’s a support that keeps our local arts scene vibrant, our public events safe and staffed, our nonprofits operational, our parks clean, and our local businesses booming.
To tinker with that engine out of ideological spite — or worse, as a calculated move to pressure elected officials to fall in line — isn’t just reckless. It’s economically self-sabotaging.
This isn’t just a game of political chess. These are real dollars, real jobs, and real people whose lives depend on a functioning, forward-looking city government. And to even contemplate disrupting that system for the sake of dismantling protections for LGBTQ+ youth reveals a staggering disregard for both moral responsibility and fiscal stewardship.
If the rumors are true — if the mayor or other officials worked behind closed doors to cut Columbia off from state support in hopes of toppling a policy they couldn’t defeat in open debate — then they must be held accountable. Not just at the ballot box, but in the court of public opinion and historical memory.
Because when elected leaders lobby against their own city’s interests — when they betray the people they were sworn to serve — they don’t just break public trust. They break the very foundation on which local democracy stands.
And that, no matter what the political calculus, is indefensible.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0686-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

Medicaid provides coverage to over 1 in 4 Massachusetts residents, playing a vital role in our state’s health care system and the strength of our economy.
The post Tallying the crucial impact of Medicaid in Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR MOST PEOPLE in Massachusetts who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicaid is not top of mind. But the fact is that MassHealth, as Medicaid is called in our state, provides coverage to over 1 in 4 of our residents. Because of this, the program plays a vital role in our state’s health care system and the strength of our economy.If you think about the wide range of people who depend on MassHealth, chances are that someone in your life has relied on it at some point in their life.It could be the woman working as a cashier at a local business who can get prenatal care to give her baby the best chance at a healthy start in life, or your friend’s child with autism receiving the support services they need to reach their full potential.It may be a recent high school graduate who is pursuing higher education and job training to advance their career without the fear of losing insurance coverage, or your neighbors working in low-wage sectors who want to provide health security for their families. Or it could be relatives who are elderly or living with a disability who have services and supports that help them stay in their home instead of going to a care facility.Despite its importance, Medicaid is now squarely on the chopping block. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed its so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a legislative package that includes nearly $700 billion in reduced federal spending on Medicaid that would significantly reduce funding to states and result in major losses in health coverage. The measure, designed to offset the cost of tax cuts proposed by the new administration, moves on to the Senate.It is crucial that we understand the major role MassHealth plays in ensuring that all residents of Massachusetts have access to health care, as well as the devastating impact federal cuts to the program would have on individuals and families (our friends and neighbors), doctors, home care services, nursing homes and hospitals – and the state’s economy.In Massachusetts, over 2 million people receive their health insurance through MassHealth. It provides coverage to two-thirds of people with low incomes (below 133 percent of the federal poverty level; about $20,800 annually for a one-person household in 2024). In contrast to common perception, over 75 percent of people covered by MassHealth under age 65 live in working families. Each year, MassHealth provides health insurance to hundreds of thousands of low-income workers who could not otherwise afford coverage, working in sectors such as food services, transportation, retail sales, cleaning, and construction.MassHealth covers residents across the lifespan, including almost 40 percent of all births in Massachusetts, 48 percent of children and young people up to age 20, almost 60 percent of people with disabilities, and 70 percent of residents in nursing homes.Because MassHealth funds are central to the financial support of our health care system, the impacts of cuts could threaten access for all of us. MassHealth funds account for over 50 percent of patient revenue for nursing homes and more than 45 percent of funding for community health centers and long-term services and supports (such as home health care and personal care assistants). Approximately 18 percent of all of hospital patient revenue comes from the MassHealth program.In addition to the direct and indirect hit on our economy, it is important to note that 86 percent of all federal revenue in our current state budget is generated by federal Medicaid reimbursement. That reimbursement totals more than $12 billion annually, covering half of the cost of the MassHealth program.Major federal Medicaid cuts could shift hundreds of millions of dollars in costs onto the Commonwealth and would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for our state to sustain the high coverage rates that MassHealth has made possible.It’s hard to overstate the harm posed by potential cuts to Medicaid. Even for those of us who do not use the program for our health insurance, it is important to recognize that, whether we know it or not, people in our lives and with whom we interact every day rely on Medicaid. Cuts would reduce funding for the health care system that our families use. And such cuts would harm the economy and competitiveness of Massachusetts.This is too big a threat to stay silent about. We can work with the federal government to continue to make improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicaid. There is no mistaking, however, that we all need to defend the funding of this critical program.Audrey Shelto is president and CEO of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation.The post Tallying the crucial impact of Medicaid in Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/b09ed834-68ba-4e30-909f-e21b56bc720a.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

Arraj United States Courthouse in Denver on April 21, 2025. Macdonald represents plaintiffs who are suing the Trump administration over their potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Immigration advocates in Colorado say they have identified about 12 immigrants in Colorado whom they believe federal authorities have removed to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Some details of their cases are uncertain, because immigration authorities, both in court proceedings and through public communication, have largely refused to release information about enforcement activities.
But lawyers and community groups working on behalf of the immigrants — through contact with family members, media coverage, videos from CECOT, and scant clues from federal sources — have constructed the best available profile of people who vanished from Colorado.
As Colorado Newsline previously reported, Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, in April first revealed in federal court in Denver that at least 11 people had been removed from Colorado to the brutal prison in El Salvador. The ACLU represents two Venezuelan nationals, as well as a larger class of immigrants, who are being held at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora and fear deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime law invoked by President Donald Trump to hasten deportations.
The Colorado case is one of several throughout the country that challenges the Trump administration’s hyper-aggressive pursuit of mass deportations as unconstitutional, affording detainees little to no due process.

Attorney Laura Lunn, director of advocacy and litigation at Westminster-based Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, which has worked on the federal case of the Venezuelan detainees and others in Colorado, told Newsline this week that immigration advocates think there are “about a dozen” people the U.S. removed from Colorado to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act.
“In some instances, we were in touch with their loved ones, who said, ‘We saw our loved one on the news, and he is in CECOT,'” Lunn said.
Numerous images and videos have emerged from the prison since March 15, when American officials, in possible violation of a court order, flew 238 migrants from the U.S. to be incarcerated in El Salvador. The roughly dozen immigrants transferred from Colorado to CECOT are believed to have been on one of three March 15 flights, Lunn said. 
Newsline requested responses to a set of specific questions for this story from a spokesperson for ICE Denver. The spokesperson referred questions to a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who did not respond.
The Western region branch of the American Friends Service Committee helped to confirm, largely through interaction with family members, about six of the Colorado-to-CECOT detainees, Jennifer Piper, the region’s program director, said. They are Venezuelan men roughly between 19 and 25 years old. There is no indication any of the roughly 12 individuals from Colorado were legal residents or citizens of the U.S., but they were removed from the country before they could present facts on their own behalf, Lunn noted.
For some family members, the first indication a loved one had been transported to El Salvador was the release by CBS News of a list of detainees who were on the March 15 flights.










So, you know, you're talking two months, more than 60 days that you have no idea if your loved one is alive, dead, in El Salvador, disappeared into the immigration system in Guantanamo. No idea.


– Jennifer Piper, Western region director of the American Friends Service Committee


One Colorado detainee’s mother whom Piper works with spotted her son in a video from CECOT just this month.
“She finally was able to see her kid’s face, when they went walking down the halls,” Piper said. “So, you know, you’re talking two months, more than 60 days that you have no idea if your loved one is alive, dead, in El Salvador, disappeared into the immigration system in Guantanamo. No idea.”
Some details on at least three Colorado-to-El Salvador detainees have been reported through government and media sources. They include Jose Eduardo Moran-Garcia, Yohendry Jerez-Hernandez and Nixon Perez. Jerez-Hernandez and Perez appear on the CBS list. Sources for this story declined to give the names of other individuals they’re working with.
Colorado and Aurora became a focus of Trump’s plan for mass deportations as he campaigned for reelection last year, including during a rally in Aurora in October. Local and federal authorities in recent months have undertaken several operations against immigrants on the Front Range. They include the September arrests of four men in connection with a shooting at an apartment on Nome Street in Aurora, a raid on a “makeshift nightclub” in Adams County in January, a coordinated set of operations at residences in Denver and Aurora in February, and a raid on a “makeshift nightclub” in Colorado Springs last month.
At least some of the detainees sent from Colorado to CECOT were rounded up during these actions, Piper said, adding, “Not a single person was convicted of a crime.”
Trump administration officials often allege that some detainees in Colorado and elsewhere have ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
“It’s really important to understand that those ties have not been proven in any way,” Piper said. “They haven’t been able to provide any proof of that in any of the court documents where they’re being sued.”
Some of the removed immigrants faced criminal charges, but they were local, not federal, charges, often filed well after the individuals were initially detained, Piper said.
“No one gets to go to their final court date to argue their case” before removal, Piper said. Some detainees didn’t even face local charges and were removed to El Salvador because federal officials said, “Oh, we didn’t like your tattoo,” she said.
Lunn has appeared as a “friend of the court” during hearings for some of the Colorado detainees believed to be at CECOT. Government attorneys have never acknowledged the detainees were sent to El Salvador, she said. 
“I’ve been doing detained work for people in immigration proceedings now for about 15 years. It is unprecedented for somebody’s case to be docketed and for ICE to show up to court and say, ‘We don’t know where this person is, and we’re not at liberty to tell you where they might be,'” Lunn said.
The cases are devoid of typical due process and documentation.
“It would be one thing if there was like a legal basis that the government could point to as to why somebody was placed on one of those planes, but because they provided them no prior notice, because people were taken without the opportunity to review any allegations against them, that means that there really is no paper trail of what allegations existed,” Lunn said. “We don’t even know what the government supposedly alleged in order to invoke the (Alien Enemies Act) against people.”
She rejects the term “deportation” to describe these cases.
“It’s not a deportation, because they don’t have a deportation order,” Lunn said. “It’s lawlessness … People were disappeared.”
Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Denver issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely blocks the Trump administration from removing detainees in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act while the case is pending.

Clerk Becky Hadlock made “many serious mistakes” in the 2024 elections, but her actions did not amount to “misconduct” or “malfeasance,” Gordon determined. 
The post Governor won’t seek Weston County clerk’s removal for 2024 election errors appeared first on WyoFile .","Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock’s actions in the 2024 election did not meet the requirements for Gov. Mark Gordon to seek her removal from office, according to the governor’s review of formal complaints filed against the clerk late last year. 
“Although I recognize that Clerk Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his decision, which was released Friday. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”
An error by Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results, drawing fierce criticism from Weston County voters. Eight local qualified electors submitted a complaint to the governor’s office in December, asking him to begin the process laid out in state statute for removing a county official from office. The governor received an additional formal complaint with the same allegations in January, according to his decision. 
State law did not task Gordon with deciding whether to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. Rather he was required to determine whether to recommend the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court. 
Gordon said two factors weighed heavily in his analysis — “the legal threshold required to constitute ‘misconduct’ or ‘malfeasance,’ and the serious nature of recommending the removal of a lawfully elected county official,” he wrote. 
“The decision of who should fill a county office is best made by the people of Weston County in the next election just a little over a year away,” Gordon wrote. “Preempting that privilege without a clear and obvious showing of willfulness or intentional acts rising to the level of misconduct or malfeasance is not justifiable.” 
Altogether, Hadlock faced accusations she mishandled election ballots by ordering and using multiple ballot versions in the general election; improperly tested voting machines during the primary and general elections; used incorrect ballots in the general election, which necessitated hand-recounts; and caused a significant undercount of votes, according to Gordon’s letter. 
“These acts were not denied by Clerk Hadlock,” Gordon wrote.

For the 2024 general election, Hadlock printed three versions of the ballot due to errors on the first two. It’s not unusual for clerks to reprint ballots to correct misprintings and other errors ahead of the election, but it became a problem when some voters were given the erroneous first and second versions. 
As a result, tabulators miscounted votes in a county commission race as well as the contest for House District 1, where House Speaker Rep. Chip Neiman (R-Hulett) was running unopposed for reelection. 
The initial, unofficial results for Weston County showed Neiman received 166 votes while 1,289 voters left that part of the ballot blank, also known as an undervote. 
That count caught Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s attention on election night, he told the state canvassing board in November. When Hadlock didn’t answer his calls, he sent the sheriff’s office to her home. 
Hadlock initially denied there was an issue, but ultimately agreed to Gray’s request that her office complete a hand tabulation of the ballots, which confirmed her mistake. The recount showed that Neiman received 1,269 votes, and the results were certified by the county canvassing board. 
“I will note that in Clerk Hadlock’s interview she was not as forthcoming as I would have liked for her to be. But when confronted directly about issues and problems raised by the complainants, she did not deny the matters,” Gordon wrote. “It was disappointing that she did not appear to understand the significance of her mistakes but, again, her interview did not reveal any intent or willfulness on her part.” 
Hadlock did not immediately respond to WyoFile’s request for comment Friday. 
Gray’s office conducted its own investigation into Hadlock and came to a different conclusion than Gordon and recommended the clerk be removed from office. 
Gray did not immediately respond to WyoFile’s request for comment Friday.

Santiago/Getty Images).Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”
Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

You can read more about the section here.

If Mississippi has taught me anything, it’s that federal policy rarely trickles down as promised. For people with disabilities, especially in our state, Medicaid isn’t a political talking point—it’s survival.
Medicaid pays for in-home support, daily nursing care, medications, equipment and community access. Without it, the alternative is often institutionalization, isolation or worse.
But under the Trump administration’s proposed budget, this vital program is facing devastating cuts. Medicaid is on the chopping block, and Mississippi is standing directly in the path of the blade.
Recently, I spoke with a mother in the Mississippi Delta whose son has a rare degenerative condition. He’s nonverbal, uses a wheelchair and needs help with every aspect of daily life. For the past three years, Medicaid has provided her a modest stipend to be his paid caregiver—allowing her to stay home, care for him full-time and keep him out of a facility 90 miles away.
“If they cut this program,” she told me, “I’ll have to go back to work. But no one else can care for him. What happens to him then?”
She already knows the answer: He’ll be institutionalized. Not because he needs to be — but because that’s the only option left when Medicaid collapses and the community-based care disappears.
The Kaiser Family Foundation ranks Mississippi as one of the states most vulnerable to federal Medicaid cuts. We rely on federal funds for nearly three-quarters of our Medicaid budget. Unlike wealthier states, we don’t have the cushion (or the political will) to fill the gap if that money disappears.

And it’s not just one program on the line. The Urban Institute outlines how slashing HHS funding will kneecap services that help disabled people live independently. That includes everything from personal care attendants to case managers to basic home health. Families as Allies of Mississippi and the Mississippi Coalition for Citizens with Disabilities have issued repeated warnings, but so far, the response from many of our lawmakers has been silence.
We’ve seen this film before. And we won’t like the ending: more people forced into institutions, more families pushed to the brink and more lives lost. 
Even the Right Is Blinking. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri — hardly a progressive firebrand — was publicly opposing the Trump administration’s cuts in a recent New York Times op-ed. 
For those not familiar with Sen. Hawley’s typical position, this should raise alarm bells. 
“Medicaid isn’t a handout,” he writes. “It’s a commitment to human dignity.”
For once, he’s right. Message to current administration: If your policy has lost even Josh Hawley, maybe it’s time to ask yourself what exactly you’re defending.
What’s happening in Washington isn’t abstract. This is a direct threat to people in Mississippi, especially those with disabilities.
More than 700,000 Mississippians — about a  quarter of the state’s population — rely on Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, according to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid website.  Medicaid covers 1 in 3 Mississippians with disabilities.  Medicaid provides not only health care, but also essential supports like personal care services, durable medical equipment and access to home and community-based services that allow people to live independently instead of being institutionalized.
The latest GOP proposals in Congress may avoid the most dramatic cuts for now, but they still set the stage for devastating consequences. Policies like work requirements and funding clawbacks are being framed as “moderate reforms,” but let’s be clear: they target the very people Mississippi’s system is already failing, including low-income families, disabled residents and rural communities with limited alternatives.
National experts at KFF warn that cuts of this scale could force states to reduce benefits, tighten eligibility  or shift costs in ways that make care harder to access. Recent Axios reports say Medicaid work requirements could lead to hundreds of thousands losing coverage. This is not because people can’t work, but because navigating paperwork shouldn’t be a condition for staying alive.
As of this week, Mississippi’s delegation has been largely silent, but the health care system they claim to protect is already in crisis. If these policies move forward, they’ll be accelerating a slow-motion disaster. 
The question isn’t whether cuts are “technically moderate.” The question is: Who gets left behind and who’s counting on us not to notice?
Here’s the deal: Medicaid in general is and never will be perfect. But when it’s paired with deep underinvestment and a cruel federal rollback, it stops being a policy failure and starts being a moral one. 
Mississippians with disabilities aren’t asking for special treatment. They’re asking to live in their homes. To go to school. To survive. If you gut Medicaid, you don’t just cut cost — you cut people off from their futures.
And from where I sit, the view is clear: We must sound the alarm, raise our voices and refuse to be complicit in policies designed to leave our most vulnerable behind.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Hoosiers will no longer be allowed to purchase candy and soda using taxpayer-funded food assistance, making Indiana the first state to receive a federal waiver for the restriction.
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins signed off on Indiana’s request this week, according to a Friday news release from Gov. Mike Braun’s office.
The Republican governor signed an executive order in April as part of his “Make Indiana Healthy Again” plan to limit the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The new policy will take effect Jan. 1, 2026, per a spokesperson for the governor.
“More taxpayer-funded SNAP dollars are spent on sugary drinks and candy than on fruits and vegetables,” Braun said in a statement. “Indiana is proud to lead the way in the Make America Healthy Again agenda by making this common-sense move to return SNAP to its intended purpose: nutrition.”
RFK Jr., Dr. Oz kick off ‘Make Indiana Healthy Again’ initiative with Gov. Mike Braun

Braun said he requested the federal waiver to allow Indiana to impose its own restrictions on the program.
He pointed to USDA data showing that soda is the most purchased item with SNAP benefits. Nationwide, SNAP recipients spend more on sugary drinks, desserts and candy than on fruits and vegetables combined.
Research additionally shows children in SNAP households consume 43% more sugary beverages than children in similar-income households not enrolled in the program.
Indiana was one of the first states to apply for the waiver and is part of a broader push by the Braun administration to combat diet-related health problems and improve food quality in low-income Hoosier communities.
The announcement initially came during a rollout event for the initiative, where U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised Indiana’s approach.
“I urge every governor across America to follow your lead,” Kennedy said during the April 15 visit in Indianapolis. He called for other reforms, too, like banning certain food dyes and additives, expanding farm-to-school programs, implementing fitness testing in schools, and increasing SNAP transparency.
Related executive orders recently signed by Braun include those to add work requirements for more SNAP recipients; commissioning studies about food safety and diet-related illness; and various proposals to generally limit “waste, fraud and abuse” in the state’s Medicaid program.

Jared Polis signs House Bill 25-1309 into law on May 23, 2025 in Denver, Colorado. The law prohibits health insurers to deny affirming care coverage. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation into law on Friday that codifies health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care.
“Today, we’re sending a clear message: Coloradans will not let politics get in the way of medical care. As we face national efforts to erase access to gender-affirming care, including threats to Medicaid and pending decisions at the Supreme Court, we’re stepping up to protect what we know is right,” bill sponsor Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat, said ahead of the bill signing.
House Bill 25-1309 prohibits insurance plans from limiting or denying gender-affirming care that a doctor identifies as medically necessary. That care is an array of interventions for people whose gender is different than their sex assigned at birth, and can include things like hormone therapy, facial reconstruction, hair removal and breast augmentation.
The law also shields testosterone prescriptions from the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. That program is intended to prevent duplicate or excessive prescriptions of opiates for people, but advocates worry it could be weaponized to go after providers who prescribe hormone therapy for transgender patients.
Brown sponsored the bill alongside Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and Colorado’s first openly transgender lawmaker, Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Littleton Democrat, and Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat. It passed with entirely Democratic support with a 23-12 vote in the Senate and 40-20 vote in the House.
“Putting this into law today will keep the people who are relying on the services of their doctors to be able to get that, and for parents to be able to know that their kids are going to have the care that they need,” Titone said.
Twenty-six states have gender-affirming care bans in place at some level, according to the Human Rights Campaign. There are also threats at the federal level. An executive order from President Donald Trump in January restricts care for transgender youth, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill yesterday that bans gender-affirming care for people on Medicaid and plans under the Affordable Care Act.
“Regardless of what the federal government does to restrict our personal freedom and our privacy, in a ‘Colorado For All,’ we want to make sure we protect our basic freedom to keep the government out of the doctor’s office,” Polis said.
Polis also signed House Bill 25-1312 into law last week, which added protections for transgender people into the state’s anti-discrimination law.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerA Vermont migrant farmworker, one of nine who were detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in April, has been released on bond, while two others had their bond denied during hearings on Thursday.Jose Edilberto Molina-Aguilar’s $10,000 bond will be paid by Vermont Freedom Fund, an independent nonprofit that Migrant Justice helped set up during the first Trump administration, according to Will Lambek, a spokesperson at Migrant Justice, an advocacy organization for migrant rights.Meanwhile, Meredith Tyrakoski, a judge in San Antonio Immigration Court, denied bond motions for both Jesus Mendez Hernandez and Adrian Zunun-Joachin, according to Lambek.All three are being held at the Karnes County Immigration Processing Center in Texas. Diblaim Maximo Sargento-Morales — who was also detained last month while working for Vermont’s largest dairy — was released on bond from the same processing center a week ago. He arrived at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport over the weekend in an orange T-shirt and camouflage pants.“Thank you for all the support you’ve shown me and my coworkers,” Sargento-Morales told a group of supporters in Spanish, according to a social media post by Migrant Justice. Sargento-Morales’ bond was set at $1,500, the lowest amount possible by law.Four of the detained farmworkers — Juan Javier Rodriguez-Gomez, Luis Enrique Gomez Aguilar, Urillas Sargento and Dani Alvarez-Perez — have already been deported to Mexico by ICE without a hearing or an opportunity to request asylum. They were deported from a facility in Louisiana under “expedited removal” procedures, according to Brett Stokes, their attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. READ MORE
In the past, that authority has only applied to people seeking entry through a checkpoint or found crossing the border, but under the second Trump administration, it’s been used for people who currently live in the U.S. and don’t fall within the typical scope of that deportation process.Such removals are almost impossible to challenge, according to Stokes.U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained eight farmworkers on April 21. They were working on Pleasant Valley Farms, a dairy in northern Vermont, just a few miles from the Canadian border. The detainment has been described by advocates as the largest single immigration arrest of farmworkers in recent Vermont history.Arbey Lopez-Lopez, who was employed at Pleasant Valley Farms for at least five years according to his attorney, was arrested almost two weeks earlier at an intersection patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. He was held in immigration detention for 42 days, primarily at FCI Berlin, a federal prison in New Hampshire, before he was released on a $3,000 bond by an immigration judge on Monday.He was transferred to New England’s Immigration and Customs and Enforcement headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts, on Thursday, where advocates from Migrant Justice drove to pick him up. “I presented to the judge that if this guy isn’t released, his 5-year-old child is going to become destitute because his housing is tied up with his employment,” Lopez-Lopez’s attorney Enrique Mesa said on Thursday.Mesa said he plans to help Lopez-Lopez apply for a work permit, and he’ll ask U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services to cancel his removal proceedings, arguing that he is the sole financial support for his daughter.Like the other eight migrant workers, Lopez-Lopez is originally from Mexico. He has lived in Vermont since 2006. The government opted to close previous removal proceedings for Lopez-Lopez in 2018, said Mesa, adding: “It really has me scratching my head on why the government decided to detain him again.”Mesa said it was apparent at the bond hearing on Monday that Border Patrol officers “were stalking immigrants at a certain intersection.” As a member of Migrant Justice, Mesa said Lopez-Lopez knew his rights, but patrol agents told him he had an order of deportation and threatened to break down the window of his vehicle if he didn’t comply and go with them. Lopez-Lopez then left the vehicle and was detained, according to Mesa. He had gone to pick up groceries which he was delivering back to his co-workers at the farm.“I find it very irritating that people can’t practice their normal routines and their normal lives without thinking ICE is going to be there harassing them,” Mesa said. “I understand them going after criminals but this guy (Lopez-Lopez) was going to get his groceries.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Another detained migrant farmworker in Vermont has been released on bond.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-36-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

(Getty Images)Two legal advocacy organizations filed legal action Friday over an executive order by Gov. Patrick Morrisey that requires the state health officials to recognize religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s schools vaccine mandates — exemptions that are not a part of state law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice filed the writ of mandamus Friday in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
The petition asks the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
“The question before this Court is simple: Can the West Virginia Governor, through Executive Order, override a clear and mandatory directive created by state statute and, in so doing, relieve state actors of nondiscretionary duties assigned to them through state code?” the petition says. “To that, West Virginia Courts have a clear and decisive answer: No, he may not. For that reason, Petitioner files this action respectfully requesting this Court compel Respondents to engage in their nondiscretionary duties as it relates to granting and denying exemptions to the state’s compulsory immunization statute.”
The petition also names as respondents Justin Davis, interim commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health, and Dr. Arvin Singh, cabinet secretary of the West Virginia Department of Health.
All states require that school students be vaccinated for certain infectious diseases like measles, chicken pox and polio. Until this year, West Virginia has been one of five states that allow only medical exemptions to those requirements. 
In January, Morrisey issued an executive order directing state health officials to allow religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine mandates. The executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, which states that the government shall not “substantially burden” someone’s right to religious freedom unless doing so is essential to further a compelling governmental interest. The order also directed the state health officer to come up with legislation and rules to facilitate religious exemptions.
Senate Bill 460, legislation that would have established religious exemptions in state law, did not become law during the 2025 regular session. The bill passed in the Senate, but was rejected by the House of Delegates. 
Despite the bill not passing, Morrisey has not rescinded the executive order. Schools in the state have had a fractured response to the order. Some private schools have said, despite the order, they will not recognize religious exemptions to the school vaccine laws. 
State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt issued a memo May 2 to county superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend schools next year without the required vaccinations. Before the day was up, though, the memo was rescinded at Morrisey’s request.
“Governors do not rule by decree,” ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in an ACLU news release. “At the center of this lawsuit is who gets to make these decisions for our students. On this question, the state Constitution is clear that the authority lies with the Legislature, not the governor.”
“Parents should be able to know their child will be safe when they send them off to school,” Sarah Brown, executive director of Mountain State Justice, said in the release. “We are seeing the devastating effects of loosening vaccine requirements across the country, and that’s why the Legislature wisely declined to loosen the restrictions here in West Virginia. It’s vital that their decision not be undermined by the executive branch.”
The petition has been assigned to Kanawha Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard.
Emails to Morrisey’s office and to the state Department of Health seeking comment were not immediately returned Friday afternoon.

Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, prepares for Senate Republicans to force a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion on May 14 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).On the evening of May 14, when the House side of the Missouri legislature was almost a ghost town, state Rep. Mark Sharp’s phone started buzzing with messages telling him that “things are getting ready to blow up in the Senate.”
Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, started making his way to the Senate when he heard chanting. Protesters were in the Senate expressing their opposition to HJR 73, which would put an abortion ban on the 2026 ballot.
After visitors were cleared out to stop the protest, security began to let people back in, and Sharp and dozens of other representatives crammed into the spaces along the edge of the Senate floor to watch what would happen next.
“You had about 50 reps on the Senate floor … maybe 20 Democrats and another 30 Republicans all mixed together. All kinds of camera crews. I’ve never seen the Senate that packed before,” Sharp said.
“Then, they moved for the previous question, and then did it again on Prop A,” he added. “Then they adjourned. I was literally stunned.”
After a session considered uncharacteristically productive and bipartisan by recent standards, the Missouri Senate, on the second-to-last day of the 2025 session, broke with its own longstanding tradition and overrode a filibuster.
To do it, Senate Republicans pulled out a rarely used procedural tool called a “previous question,” or PQ, to close debate and force votes on the abortion bill and a bill to repeal paid sick leave protections.
Senate Republicans’ use of the PQ shocked the Missouri legislature for a number of reasons, one being that the tool is very rarely used, because it’s seen as antithetical to the chamber’s tradition of unlimited debate.
The other is that the move came after a session in which Republicans and Democrats, despite their disagreements, were able to find some common ground and collaborate on legislation.
Legislating from the Missouri legislature’s ‘superminority’
Republicans have held a two-thirds supermajority in both chambers of the Missouri legislature since 2012. This year, Democrats held 10 of 34 Senate seats and 52 of 161 House seats.
Even so, this session was marked by considerable bipartisan cooperation — a stark contrast from previous years, when Republican infighting dominated the Senate and made it difficult to get much of anything to the governor’s desk.
While extreme political polarization nationally might make bipartisan cooperation seem impossible, it’s a requirement in the Missouri legislature if Democrats want to get anything done, said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat.
“I would not be successful as a legislator if I worked in a silo or if I worked on purely hyperpartisan issues. That’s not going to get me anywhere as a Democrat in the superminority of Missouri,” she said. “It all comes down to me finding common ground with others.”
State Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, speaks during a press conference during the 2025 legislative session ( Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Sharp said: “As a member of the superminority, we have to constantly, constantly be talking to these folks in the majority party daily. They’re the ones controlling everything.”
Republican House leadership — including House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit, Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley of Springfield and committee chairs — have control over every step in the legislative process, including whether a bill is introduced and referred to a committee.
Because of that, “at every corner, we should be working across the aisle to make sure that these bipartisan pieces of legislation are given a chance … because we know the partisan ones won’t,”  Sharp said.
He said “it can be frustrating” to be a Democrat working in the Republican supermajority-controlled Missouri legislature, but “you’ve got to have a short memory.”
Despite being in the supermajority, many Republicans were “absolutely” interested in working with Democrats, Nurrenbern said.
One of those Republicans was Sen. Kurtis Gregory from Marshall. He and Nurrenbern together represent Clay County in the Senate, and “as soon as we were both elected, we sat down and talked about what we could do together to move Clay County forward,” she said.
When Nurrenbern decided to file a bill to create a Clay County Sports Authority, she reached out to him and said, “I would like you to champion this with me.”
“He was an absolutely great supporter every step of the way to get that done,” she said. “He was … excited to carry that legislation with me.”
But the collaboration wasn’t just one-way, Nurrenbern said. Sen. Mike Henderson, a Desloge Republican, also asked for her input on a massive education bill he was working on.
“He came to me right away and said: ‘Maggie, I’d really like your input on this. You’re a former educator. I respect your opinion on these provisions, and I want to work with you on this,’” Nurrenbern said.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, cosponsored several bipartisan bills this session and said it was “refreshing” to work across the aisle.
“I’m in a district that’s 50/50, and I feel like my constituents want me to work together with people of all political stripes and all backgrounds to find common-sense solutions,” McCreery said. “They appreciate that politicians aren’t fighting all the time and calling each other names.”
While some issues consistently divide Republicans and Democrats in the Missouri legislature, others offer more opportunities for bipartisan cooperation, such as economic development and health care.
“All of the things I worked on successfully with colleagues from the other side of the aisle are just issues that are going to help make people’s lives a little bit better,” McCreery said.
 Making legislation ‘a little less bad’

For Democrats in both chambers of the Missouri legislature, getting a policy over the finish line often means amending another bill to include their language. It’s especially critical in the House, Sharp said.
“Freshman Democrats feel like their specific House bills should be moving. That’s now how it works. … Republicans aren’t going to pass a bill in your name,” Sharp said.
McCreery said it’s “pretty common” for Senate Democrats, when they’re unable to block the passage of a bill, to try getting some of their own bills added as amendments to soften the impact.
“Once the supermajority decides that a bill is going to move and make it out of the chamber, you, as a senator, have to decide. Do I want to try to stop it, or do I want to try to make a bad bill a little less bad by putting some good things on it?” McCreery said.
McCreery said one example was a “terrible” omnibus utility law that passed early in the session, which she said will increase Missourians’ utility rates.
“I voted no on it, but I was able to get some consumer protections in there for low-income people,” she added. “It was a tough decision, but I didn’t have the ability to stop the bill, so then I had to make a decision to try to put some things in there that can make it a little less harmful to people.”
Nurrenbern said she tries to remember “that we, as Senate Democrats, are just 10 of 34 senators” and that “while we should have a mark on the legislation that is passed, it is going to be not as large a mark as the Republican supermajority.”
“I don’t think a single piece of legislation got across the finish line without Democratic input,” she added. “But we also recognize that we’re not going to be overdemanding or overbearing in our asks. The asks that we put forward are reasonable, I think, and are really in the spirit of serving Missouri well.”
Sharp said that unlike in previous years, House leadership — and especially Patterson, who just completed his first session as speaker — was more open to keeping an open dialogue with Democrats.
“I will give House Speaker Patterson this: he did a very good job of working with Democrats, (and) particularly African-American Democrats in Kansas City,” Sharp said. “He made time for us regularly in Jefferson City and in Kansas City.”
That shift meant that “a few more opportunities were thrown to members of my caucus,” Sharp said, with Patterson and various Republican committee chairs being more willing to help some of Democrats’ bills move through the legislative process.
Those opportunities meant that Democrats, including freshmen, were able to add their bills’ language as amendments to Republican legislation, including bills banning hair discrimination in schools, extending a tax credit for donations to diaper banks and eliminating sales taxes on diapers and feminine hygiene products.
But other House bills with bipartisan support were casualties of the Senate’s breakdown. That included Sharp’s bill requiring some people with DUIs to install ignition interlocks in their car, which he said was on the Senate agenda but was effectively “killed” when the PQ was used.
 The impact of a PQ in the Missouri legislature

With the use of the PQs, “all of that bipartisan cooperation and collaboration was pretty much thrown out the window,” according to McCreery.
At the time, Republicans and Democrats had been negotiating to find a compromise on Republicans’ bill to repeal Proposition A’s paid sick leave protections, passed by voters last fall.
“We were working right up to when we were given word that negotiations were finished,” McCreery said. “I went into that Wednesday still feeling hopeful that we would figure something out.”
According to the Missouri Independent, Democrats told Republican leadership they would stop filibustering the two bills if language were changed to remove references to gender-affirming care for minors — which is already illegal in Missouri — from the abortion bill and to allow for minimum wage to rise with inflation.
McCreery — who was leading the filibuster when the PQs were used — said “the PQ may have been used against me, but it’s bigger than me.”
“Shutting down the debate was done against the will of the people. And that’s what makes this more harmful and harder to look the other way on, because the PQ was used on me, but shutting down debate was used against 1.5, 1.6 million Missourians that voted for Prop A or voted for Amendment 3,” she said.
That move “eroded my trust and confidence to negotiate in good faith with Republican senators,” Nurrenbern said.
While Democrats said negotiators were on track to find a solution, Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said on the day of the PQ that “goalposts were being moved” in those negotiations, which ultimately “hit a logjam.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe was working behind the scenes in the lead-up to the PQ to try to prevent it and improve the chances of the Missouri legislature passing his proposed stadium funding plan, according to the Missouri Independent.
In the lead-up to the PQ, Nurrenbern and other Democrats said that while they enjoyed the bipartisan cooperation, “That is not going to be the case next session.”
“It marked a change in how we are going to operate as senators,” Nurrenbern said. “There are a lot of motions that happen throughout the legislative day in the Missouri Senate, and we are going to use every opportunity to make our point that it’s paramount to negotiate in good faith.”
McCreery said she didn’t want to speculate about how Democrats might proceed, but did say that “it’s going to be much harder to get things done, even things that are perceived as nonpartisan or noncontroversial. There was a lot of harm done not just to this session, but future sessions as well.”
“I’m certainly disappointed with how session ended this year, and I have a long memory,” she added. “I don’t anticipate that I’ll go into special session this summer or regular session next January with all of this disrespect just put behind me.”
 Preparing for the special session and 2026 in the Missouri legislature

Gov. Mike Kehoe recently announced that he will call lawmakers back to Jefferson City for a special session sometime this summer to vote on a bill to provide state funding for a new Royals stadium and a renovated Chiefs stadium.
Nurrenbern said she doesn’t know “what the call is for special session yet, but I would certainly expect to see some of that spill over.”
McCreery said Democrats “have not had any discussions” about the special session.
“I will say, as someone who is a proud resident of the St. Louis region, to see all of the destruction that happened on Friday night with the tornado, it’s going to be really hard to think about giving $900 million or more to a wealthy team owner when we’ve got so much destruction in the St. Louis region that is going to have to be dealt with,” she said.
Sharp — who has been a vocal advocate for finding a way to keep the Royals and Chiefs in Missouri — said an even bigger barrier to getting the stadium bill passed will be senators’ lingering resentment over the House failing to pass a massive construction bill.
However, he said he’s optimistic that House leadership will put it up for a vote during the special session to clear the way for the Senate to pass the stadium bill.
At a press conference after the end of session, Kehoe told reporters he understands lawmakers’ concerns about the construction bill.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
As Democrats prepare for the sessions to come, Nurrenbern said she hopes to see bipartisanship in the Missouri legislature again.
“Everybody comes from a different walk of life, from a different area of the state, and we work best — and the institution works best — when we come together for the common good,” she said. “I hope we get back there sooner than later.”

The mayors say they won't back down.","The Trump administration is suing, clockwise from top left, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, among others, in a complaint that targets the city's ordinances that protect undocumented immigrants from detention and deportation. (Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The U.S. government sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken and their elected officials for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
Prosecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.
“The United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,” the lawsuit states. “While states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.”
The complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, and the cities’ council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey’s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.
Baraka blasted the latest prosecution as “absurd.”
“We are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,” he said in a statement. “Nothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.”
Fulop said he would not be “bullied” and vowed to fight the feds.
“Jersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city — I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,” he said. “Here is the truth: Jersey City’s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.”
And Sayegh dismissed the complaint as “a frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.”
“We will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson’s expense,” Sayegh said.
Bhalla also said his city “will not back down.”
“The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,” he said.
In the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring “otherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.”
Prosecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump’s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit “even the most basic cooperation with federal officials” and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.
“These efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,” the complaint states.
The complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.
“Such discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,” the complaint says.
The complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.
Jail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka’s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.
Immigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds’ attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities’ policies don’t violate federal law but instead “reflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.” She urged the cities to resist caving to federal “bullying.”
“Over the last few months, the Trump Administration’s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey — first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,” Torres said in a statement. “It is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.”

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied North Carolina’s appeal of its April decision to stop matching 100% of the state’s spending on Hurricane Helene recovery.
The ruling came Thursday in a letter from the person serving as the agency’s acting leader, David Richardson, that provided little in the way of explanation. Richardson was elevated to the position of “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator” after the person President Donald Trump selected as Acting Administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was fired earlier this month, one day after delivering congressional testimony in he expressed disagreement with the administration’s plans to dismantle the agency.
This is from Ricardson’s denial letter:

“You specifically requested an extension of the 100 percent federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days.
After a careful and thorough review of all the information available, including that contained in your initial request for a cost share adjustment and appeal, we have concluded that an extension of the 100 percent federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days under major disaster declaration FEMA-4827-DR is not warranted.”

As NC Newsline previously reported, the ruling leaves the state on the hook for up to $200 million or more in additional expenses for debris cleanup and other emergency work.
In a statement responding to the ruling, Gov. Josh Stein expressed disappointment but promised to press on with Helene cleanup and recovery efforts:

“The first step to help western North Carolina recover is to clean up all the debris. So far, we have removed more than 12 million cubic yards of debris from roads and water ways, but given the immense scale of the wreckage, we have only scratched the surface. FEMA’s denial of our appeal will cost North Carolina taxpayers potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up out west. The money we have to pay toward debris removal will mean less money towards supporting our small businesses, rebuilding downtown infrastructure, repairing our water and sewer systems, and other critical needs.
Despite this news, we are going to stay the course. We will keep pushing the federal and state governments to do right by western North Carolina. We will keep working with urgency, focus, and transparency to get any appropriated money on the ground as quickly as we can to speed the recovery. We will not forget the people of western North Carolina.”

The ruling came the same day the North Carolina House unanimously approved a bill that would provide $464 million in new relief for western North Carolina — roughly half of what Stein had asked for. That bill is likely to be part of the House-Senate state budget negotiations that will take place in the coming weeks.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

Philip Randolph Career and Technical High School on May 23, 2025 in Philadelphia and met with students, teachers, and legislators for public K-12 education. (Commonwealh Media Services)Gov. Josh Shapiro said he has “confidence in the leadership” at Penn State following a decision made by the university’s board of trustees on Thursday to close seven of its 19 Commonwealth Campuses.
“They know they need to right-size. They know they need to plan for the long term future, and to do that, they needed to make these tough choices,” Shapiro said. “And I have faith in (Penn State President) Neeli Bendapudi and her administration and the board who made those decisions.”
Penn State DuBois, Fayette, Mont Alto, New Kensington, Shenango, Wilkes-Barre and York are slated to close following the spring 2027 semester after a “two-year wind-down period.”
WPSU described the 25-8 vote by Penn State’s board of trustees on Thursday night to close those campuses as “contentious,” adding that leadership argued the move was necessary for future success for the university. Bendapudi said that enrollment dropped 43% over the past 10 years at the campuses that are slated to close.
However, critics of the decision say they believe the decision was “rushed and lacking community input.”
“I know that when a school like Penn State, a satellite campus leaves a community, that can leave a big hole, and so my administration is committed to working with Penn State and those affected communities to make sure they are taken care of going forward,” Shapiro said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State Sen. Wayne Langerholc and state Rep. Michael Armanini, both Republicans, represent districts that include Penn State DuBois. They issued a statement critical of the plan to close the campus.
“I am deeply dismayed that all of the advocacy and education of the significant benefit of Penn State DuBois have fallen on deaf ears,” said Langerholc. “For multiple years, this institution embraced the mantra and model of Penn State and produced students who contribute to the local workforce, drive economic activity, and make our region and commonwealth stronger.”

“Today that relationship was broken,” he added. “I am committed to working with my colleagues in the House to identify an entity that appreciates our rural area and will take the broken baton to repair and strengthen our community.”
Armanini described the school as a “hub of manufacturing businesses which include the carbon, and graphite industries.”
 “Not only does this decision impact the students of Penn State DuBois, it impacts our communities,” Armani said. “The campus provides jobs to residents of DuBois and the surrounding community, income for local businesses who rely on the student body and faculty, and the local industry which benefits from the research of the school and has a talented pool of students to employ after graduation.”
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) also represents a district that includes one of the satellite campuses, Penn State New Kensington. He offered a different point of view from his GOP colleagues.
“The harsh reality is that higher education in general throughout Pennsylvania is greatly oversubscribed. We have too much physical plant in higher education to support the declining demographics that we are faced with, and there has also been a significant increase in the variety of job opportunities available that don’t necessarily comport with the deliverables of higher education in this state,” Pittman said. “Rightsizing is a necessary step that must happen across higher education. However, the process from a transparency perspective and the lack of messaging on what these campuses can be used for going forward has been far from ideal.”
Pittman said that he does not favor losing the campus in his district, but argued the “big picture view” of the issue was that change is needed in higher education and that conversations will be needed to ensure that “the launch box and digital foundry they have supported continue, and we figure out a path to make the property even more productive than it is now.”
“Ultimately, Penn State will have an obligation to make sure the campuses are all repurposed and brought to a higher and better use in the communities where they reside,” he said. “This is a responsibility the university bears, and their efforts must be supported by the state. We cannot allow closed satellite campuses to become blighted properties. The facilities must be repurposed in a thoughtful way.”
The university’s plan will need approval from the state Department of Education.

(Courtesy of Department of Game and Fish / Jim Stuart)The beloved fairy bee, the Sacramento Mountain Salamander and the jaguar share one common trait: a spot on New Mexico’s 2025 blueprint for animal conservation.
State wildlife officials released the New Mexico State Action Wildlife Plan earlier this month, identifying more than 500 species listed requiring need for conservation — more than double from the previous plan released in 2017.
Next week marks the halfway point for the public comment period on the guidance documents, which ends June 9. The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish is required to review and revise these plans every decade and submit them to the federal government. The plan will be considered for approval by the State Game Commission later this fall.
A warming climate, environmental fragmentation from development and threats like disease all pose threats for New Mexico species, even as it remains one of the most biodiverse states in the U.S., said Ginny Seamster, the assistant chief for technical guidance at the agency.
“Realistically, helping these species is an all-hands-on-deck effort,” she said. “We need everyone who’s interested to participate.”
The 2025 plan doubled the number of birds and includes pollinating insects (which help plants reproduce), which had been left off the species plan in past years,
“There are some species that are only associated with a single plant, so if you remove the pollinator from the ecosystem, you’re losing the plant, too,” Seamster said. “You’re multiplying the loss of biodiversity.”



How to participate
Public comment on the draft plan remains open until June 9, and can be submitted via email: dgf-SWAP@dgf.nm.gov
“Since this is a statewide plan, and we really want anyone who’s interested in a species of greatest conservation needs to be able to see themselves in it,” Seamster said.



The increase in species signals both the threats many animals in New Mexico face and the reforms underway at the wildlife agency. The State Wildlife plan dovetails with a series of changes the agency is enacting after the passage of Senate Bill 5 in the legislative session, which dramatically increased funding and expanded the scope of the department into the New Mexico Wildlife Department.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

The Legislature approved a $10 million dollar three-year pilot project funding work related to species of greatest conservation need, and the department is now receiving several million dollars in interest from the Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund in addition to revenue from hunting and fishing fees.
The department is currently working to hire additional biologists to carry out the work, Seamster said, noting that previously,  it only assigned one biologist to non-game birds.
“There are over 500 species of birds found in the state, and nearly 150 birds are species of greatest conservation need. That is clearly too many species for one person to be able to address,” she said. “Having more staff means we can do a lot more research, a lot more habitat work.”
Advocates, who fought and succeeded in reforming the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, say they’re excited about the plan, which they hope will be the “gold standard” for wildlife agencies.
“Across the country, agencies are going to look at what New Mexico’s doing and see how we manage wildlife: from the top to the bottom, from the bumble bees to the bison,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the nonprofit New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “It’s all necessary for an intact ecosystem.”
Deubel said federal efforts to freeze and roll back conservation work exacerbate climate change impacts such as increased wildfire and shrinking wetlands. But funding for New Mexico’s wildfire agency comes from the state, he noted. That means: “We’re going to be able to continue doing unbelievable conservation and habitat work in New Mexico, despite the dysfunction that’s happening at the federal level,” he said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The tax provisions in House Republicans’ so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would overwhelmingly benefit Minnesota’s wealthiest families, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank in DC.
 
If the bill passes the Senate and wins the signature of President Trump, the bottom 20% of Minnesota households, with incomes of less than $36,000, would see an average tax benefit of about $250, or 1.3% of household income. Families in the middle of the distribution, with incomes between $63,000 and $100,000, would get an average benefit of $2,000, or 2.4% of household income.
 
But Minnesota’s one-percenters, with incomes of $928,000 and above, would receive an average tax break of $66,000, adding up to 3.5% of their typical income.
 
All told, more than two-thirds of the bill’s benefits flow to the richest 20% of Minnesota families, according to ITEP’s estimate.
 
Those changes are measured against the baseline of current law, in which the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire at the end of the year. 
“For working-class Americans, the tax cuts in the House bill are extremely modest and overall taxes would rise for these families when the impact of higher import taxes, or tariffs, are accounted for,” ITEP’s authors write.
At the national level, for instance, the poorest 20% of households can expect to see their take-home pay increase by 1% as a result of the changes. But that’s more than offset by a roughly 2.4% decrease in spending power due to the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs.
The law’s provisions are also relatively favorable toward wealthy overseas investors. “Foreign investors who own shares in U.S. companies would benefit more than the poorest fifth of Americans,” ITEP’s authors write. “These foreign investors would enjoy $23 billion in tax cuts in 2026 compared to just $4 billion for the bottom 20% of Americans.”
Because Republicans are using a procedural known as “reconciliation,” the bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Republicans control 53 Senate seats, meaning they can lose three votes and still pass the bill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President J.D. Vance.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250425_1154-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t suspect any opposition to proposed pay raises for state troopers and correctional officers based on public hearings Friday morning.
The requisite meetings on new collective bargaining agreements held just before the holiday weekend concluded in under 10 minutes, with no public feedback on either contract. But legislative leaders are less than thrilled about the salary increases and accompanying benefits for roughly 1,250 state employees, which require $15 million more than what Gov. Dan McKee planned for in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal.
Unlike most other state employee unions, the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers and the Rhode Island Troopers Association had not inked new deals with the administration when McKee unveiled his proposed $14 billion spending plan in January.  So McKee put in a $30 million placeholder for the yet-to-be signed contracts.
Turns out, the agreements are actually going to cost the state $45 million over the next  two years, rather than the $30 million McKee budgeted. 
Hardly welcome news to the leaders of the Rhode Island General Assembly already grappling with a budget deficit and potentially devastating federal funding cuts just weeks before the end of the 2025 legislative session. A spending plan must be approved by the start of the new fiscal year on July 1.
“Unfortunately, the newly revealed shortfall from the Administration’s contract settlements is not the only issue we need to address in the budget,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in an emailed statement. “It certainly worsens the situation and is, frankly, beyond frustrating.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson also appeared caught off-guard by the unexpected cost hike, which she said she learned about on Wednesday.
“While this is deeply concerning, I will work with the Senate Finance Committee to address this unexpected challenge,” Lawson said in an emailed statement.
Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, defended the contract costs in an emailed response Friday, noting that the third-quarter revenue report from the state budget office shows an extra $60.9 million expected to flow into state coffers by the end of the fiscal year 2025.
“The Governor encourages the General Assembly to support the contractual increases for public safety personnel using these dollars in the upcoming budget,” Hart said.
Retroactive cost-of-living hike for State Police
Both contracts call for annual cost-of-living adjustments starting at 5% in year one, with a 4% second-year bump and a 3% adjustment in the third year — identical to the incremental scale adopted for 4,000 other state employees under contracts finalized last fall. So how did McKee mess up the math?
For one, the raises for 255 state troopers start earlier than expected: the 5% pay bump is retroactive to Nov. 1, 2023, rather than the July 1, 2024, start date for other state union workers, including correction officers, said Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration. The tentative agreement, reached on Feb. 28, also features a “uniform allowance” not accounted for in the governor’s budget projections, Greco said.
Erik Jensen, president of the state troopers union, acknowledged but did not offer a response to questions about the agreement on Friday.
Richard Ferruccio, president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, remained unsatisfied with the terms of the 1,000-member union’s new state contract, which was finalized on May 14 after months of arbitration.
“I don’t want to sound ungrateful,” Ferruccio said in an interview Friday. “But I still feel somewhat frustrated with it.”
His main grievance was not with the annual cost-of-living increases, but accompanying benefits that would make the union better able to attract and retain officers. Staffing woes at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections are well-documented, and costly; the 117 open positions as of March 22 is projected to lead to a $42.9 million overtime cost for the full fiscal year 2025, according to a presentation to state lawmakers in April. 










It certainly worsens the situation and is, frankly, beyond frustrating.


– House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi


Ferruccio blamed staffing shortages on uncompetitive benefits relative to other local law enforcement officers and neighboring states, where officers can reach the “top step” of pay in a shorter period of time. 
“There are only a handful of people that really want to get involved in any type of law enforcement,” Ferruccio said. “When you look at other local police departments, they have a significantly better situation with the top step than we do.”
He had hoped to lower the seniority requirement for union officers to reach maximum pay from its current 14 years to six years, matching the policy offered for correctional officers in Connecticut. But the compromise struck with the state cuts the length of service to 10 years beginning this June, and eight years starting in June 2026. The agreement also includes a 2.5% pay raise for anyone who stays at least 20 years. 
The governor’s budget did not account for the costs associated with these changes, either, Greco said. 
But Ferruccio said the final price tag should not have come as a surprise, noting that the changes to top step and retention benefits were longstanding asks by the union. 
“I think the governor was given bad information by DOC,” Ferruccio said. He pointed to the grossly underestimated cost to close the state’s minimum security facility — initially pegged at $1 million in McKee’s budget when a study found it would actually cost $67 million to $71 million — as an example of miscommunication by the corrections department.
J.R. Ventura, a spokesperson for the state corrections department, declined to comment when contacted Friday.
State worker contract costs are not the only expense McKee underestimated in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal. The state will also have to make up a $24 million shortfall in education aid to local school districts in its fiscal 2025 and 26 budgets due to corrected data on the number of students in poverty.

(University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture image.)President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in Arkansas related to storms that caused widespread flooding and damage from April 2-22, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency press release.
The disaster declaration covers a total of 39 counties, just over half of the state’s 75, through different disaster relief programs, according to the release. Sanders requested the declaration in a May 3 letter to Trump.
This will be the second major disaster declaration for the state this spring. Trump last week approved a major disaster declaration for nine counties affected by March 14-15 storms and tornadoes. He had initially denied the request but relented after a personal phone call from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to a May 13 statement from the governor’s office. Sanders served as Trump’s press secretary during part of his first term.
“As we recover from a long series of severe weather events, our state is incredibly thankful for President Trump’s leadership and work to deliver aid to storm-impacted communities,” Sanders said in a press release Friday. 
Friday’s disaster declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Clark, Clay, Craighead, Crittenden, Desha, Fulton, Hot Spring, Jackson, Miller, Ouachita, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Sharp, St. Francis and White counties, the FEMA press release said. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.

“Federal funding is also available to state, tribal, eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by severe storms, tornadoes and flooding in Clark, Clay, Craighead, Cross, Dallas, Desha, Fulton, Greene, Hempstead, Hot Spring, Izard, Jackson, Lafayette, Lawrence, Lee, Little River, Lonoke, Marion, Miller, Monroe, Montgomery, Nevada, Newton, Pike, Poinsett, Prairie, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Scott, Searcy, Sevier, Sharp, St. Francis, Stone and Woodruff counties,” FEMA said.
The federal disaster declaration comes after Sanders announced Thursday that the state will cover up to 35% of the cleanup and rebuilding costs county and local governments incurred from the March tornadoes and storms.
Local and county governments will have to submit expense documentation to the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, according to a press release. ADEM staff will review the reimbursement requests and inspect the projects before funds are disbursed, the release said.
Roland W. Jackson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas.

DemasThe push to get Michiganders’ identification cards replaced with federally-compliant REAL ID cards has resulted in 200,000 IDs issued to residents over a period of three months, the Michigan Department of State announced Friday.
Department employees either issued new or upgraded REAL IDs over the past 12 weeks, bringing the state into more than 76% compliance with a new U.S. requirement for REAL ID in order to travel domestically by air.
A REAL ID is a driver’s license or state identification card that has been verified with proof of U.S. citizenship and proof of legal residence in the U.S. They are distinguishable by the gold star in the upper right-hand corner. Per a change in federal law, Michigan residents as of May 7 are required to present a REAL ID-complaint card when attempting to fly anywhere in the U.S. The IDs also allow entrance to certain federal facilities as allowed by federal law. Overall, the IDs have protections against copying or altering identification information.

REAL IDs are different from Michigan’s enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses, which allow entry to and from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or the Caribbean by land or sea. Enhanced IDs, however, are also REAL ID compliant.
A news release issued Friday said Secretary of State branch offices served more than 90% of those customers within 20 minutes of their scheduled appointment times, signaling that the transition has been relatively smooth thus far.
“The hardworking staff at our branch offices throughout the state rose to this challenge and set a new standard of exceptional public service,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement. “I’m grateful for their dedication and commitment to excellence, which ensured a smooth process for Michiganders during a potentially disruptive transition. This is what it means to have a state government that truly works for people.” 
A total of 202,571 REAL ID-compliant driver’s licenses or state IDs were issued between February 23 and May 17. The week of May 4 was said to be the busiest this year, with 28,289 identification cards converted to REAL ID.

It’s a corporate giveaway. (Getty Images)As a proud Nevadan and Lake Tahoe resident who cherishes our public lands and forests, I feel compelled to speak out against the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act” (FOFA). Don’t let the title fool you! This federal legislation is no fix. In fact, it’s a reckless attempt to hand over the keys to our national forests to corporate logging interests under the guise of wildfire prevention. If passed, FOFA would open the floodgates to massive, unchecked logging projects that threaten the very landscapes we hold dear in Nevada and across the country.
Let’s start with the most alarming piece: FOFA would enable a Trump executive order to ramp up commercial logging across nearly 60% of America’s national forests. This is not hyperbole. It’s a direct result of language in FOFA that weakens environmental protections and strips the public of its voice in managing these lands. The bill allows agencies to bypass crucial environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Incredibly, it even permits NEPA reviews to happen after logging projects have already been completed, undermining the entire purpose of environmental oversight.
It gets worse. FOFA dramatically expands the size of “Categorical Exclusions” (CEs), administrative loopholes that allow certain forest projects to dodge public review and environmental study. Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input. To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.
The bill also advances a deeply flawed narrative: that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise. Study after study has shown that the most effective ways to protect communities from wildfire involve local measures, like creating defensible space around homes, hardening buildings against fire, and developing emergency response plans. FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies. Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.
Here in Nevada, we understand the value of healthy, resilient ecosystems. Our forests aren’t just scenic backdrops. They’re critical to our water supplies, our recreation, and our identity. The Fix Our Forests Act threatens that balance. It’s a Trojan horse for deregulation, designed to sideline science, slash public involvement, and clear the way for extractive industries. Worse yet, it aligns directly with recent moves by the Trump administration to prioritize timber extraction over environmental stewardship. Just days before FOFA was introduced in the Senate, Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture released a memo implementing an executive order to massively expand logging across federal lands.
This is the same administration that has gutted staff at the U.S. Forest Service and slashed funding for wildfire prevention. If President Trump and the U.S. Congress truly cared about protecting communities, we’d see investments in firefighter support, forest restoration, and climate resilience, not just more clear-cutting. Instead, his executive order and FOFA combine to create a dangerous one-two punch: under-resourced forest agencies forced to chase arbitrary timber targets, at the expense of meaningful wildfire mitigation.
Let’s be clear: climate change, not tree density, is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West. Rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and increasingly erratic weather patterns are drying out our forests and setting the stage for firestorms. Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive. More logging won’t bring back the rain. What we need is bold, climate-smart leadership that prioritizes long-term forest health and community safety over short-term industry profits.
Unfortunately, Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03) and Congressman Mark Amodei (NV-02) cosponsored FOFA in the House, and Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04) voted for the bill. Congresswoman Dina Titus (NV-01) was Nevada’s lone “nay.” The bill will now make its way through the U.S. Senate and Nevada’s senators haven’t yet revealed how they plan to vote.
Whether we’re talking about FOFA or Trump’s executive orders, the bottom line is the same: this is an attack on our public lands. These are lands that belong to all of us, not just the timber lobby or political donors. Nevada’s senators, and senators across the country for that matter, should reject FOFA in its current form. We need our representatives to stop looking at our public lands with dollar signs in their eyes. Instead, they should champion legislation that supports fire-resilient communities through real solutions: funding for home hardening, local emergency planning, defensible space projects, and prescribed fire treatments guided by science and Indigenous knowledge.
We need forest policy rooted in stewardship, not exploitation. Nevada deserves better, and so do the forests we all depend on.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers have one week to pass a new state budget with little room for new spending and Congress presenting further challenges and uncertainty.

Revenue projections had already been declining as the spring session has progressed. Now, lawmakers who have long feared further federal cuts, are grappling with the U.S House’s passage of a spending plan that Illinois’ Senate president warns would be “catastrophic for working families” – as well as state finances.

“There's no state in the union that could survive the sorts of cuts they're proposing to health care for working families,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, told Capitol News Illinois about the bill that still needs U.S. Senate approval.

The General Assembly has through May 31 to pass a budget with a simple majority vote before the threshold increases to a three-fifths vote on June 1. House Democrats approved a portion of last year’s budget with the minimum number of votes required to pass a bill after several Democrats dissented over spending concerns.

The state’s fiscal picture is even more challenging this year. The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget lowered revenue projections earlier this month for fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, by $536 million from its February estimate, to $54.9 billion in revenue.

Harmon told host Jak Tichenor on the latest episode of “Illinois Lawmakers” that Senate Democrats have been told not to expect spending for new programs this year.

“This is a tougher year than we've seen in recent years; certainly the toughest since I've been Senate president,” Harmon said. “We have some newer members who've never had to put together a budget like this one, so we tried to make sure people tempered their expectations.”

Gov. JB Pritzker’s introduced spending plan, which was proposed in February before the latest revenue projection cuts, called for a 3% increase in state spending in a budget totaling $55.2 billion. But outside of education, health care and pensions, spending was only projected to grow by 1%.

The revenue projection cut means lawmakers likely have even less room for spending increases than what Pritzker requested in February.

“The biggest thing that I've said to the caucus pretty consistently since day one is that no one's going to get everything they want, that we have to have reasonable expectations, that we have to balance the budget,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois last week. “We're going to spend what we bring in, no more.”

Federal budget uncertainty

The challenge of balancing the budget was complicated even further Thursday when, in the early morning hours, the U.S. House passed legislation to enact much of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, which includes slashing federal spending on Medicaid, education and clean energy programs.

“The Trump administration and his policies are throwing a lot of uncertainty and making it a lot harder for us to determine how we're going to pay for the programs and services that our families rely on in Illinois,” state Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, who chairs a legislative working group that focuses on Medicaid policy, said during an interview.

Medicaid, the health care program for low-income individuals that is jointly funded with state and federal dollars, is one of the largest categories of state government spending. The program is jointly funded with state and federal funds and provides health care coverage to more than 3.4 million people in Illinois, or about a fourth of the state’s population.

In fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the state received approximately $20 billion in federal matching funds for Medicaid. That represented about 62% of the program’s total cost.

But the legislation that passed the U.S. House Thursday morning would make substantial changes to the program that would both reduce the number of people covered by Medicaid and the amount of federal matching funds the state receives.

One of the most significant provisions that would affect Illinois, according to a summary by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF, would reduce the federal match rate paid for people enrolled through the Affordable Care Act expansion group by 10 percentage points.

Under that 2010 health insurance reform law, also known as “Obamacare,” states were allowed to expand eligibility for Medicaid to include working-age adults, including those without dependents, with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.

In Illinois, more than 772,000 people are enrolled in Medicaid under that program and the federal government pays 90% of the cost of their care, according to IDHFS. But the House legislation would drop that matching rate to 80% for Illinois and other states that also provide health coverage or financial assistance to people who are not lawfully present in the United States.

IDHFS has estimated that provision would cost Illinois approximately $815 million in federal matching funds per year because the state currently operates two such programs – one for adults ages 42-64, and another for seniors over age 65 – although Pritzker has proposed eliminating the one for adults under age 65.

Under current state law, however, coverage under the ACA expansion program automatically ends if the federal government ever lowers its reimbursement rate below 90%.

Other provisions of the congressional bill would require states to impose work requirements on enrollees in the ACA expansion group and require those individuals to verify their eligibility for the program at least twice per year.

“We don’t have the resources to backfill that,” Moeller said. “It would be beyond the scope of our budget right now to be able to do that.”

The total impact the proposed legislation would have on Illinois remains unclear, and the bill still must be considered by the U.S. Senate, which could make changes of its own.

Illinois would also have to spend more on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, beginning in 2028. The bill would require states to pay for 5% of benefits and 75% of administrative costs, rather than 50% of administrative costs and nothing for benefits.

Other parts of the plan would slash federal tax incentives for clean energy and nuclear projects by the end of 2028, potentially forcing the state to pay more to reach its goal of carbon-free electricity by 2045.

It's possible lawmakers will return to Springfield later this year to update the FY26 budget based on changes at the federal level.

“This president can send out a tweet that changes the world, and we may have to come back,” Welch said. “And so, we've been preparing the caucus that that's a possibility: know that something could happen based on the federal budget that brings us back.”

But Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, said there might not be any reason to have a special session to adjust the budget later this year after reviewing what the U.S. House passed.

“I think that's pretty silly, considering nothing will be effective immediately. We'll have a lot of time to adjust,” Spain said.

Budget pressures in Illinois

Other legislative reforms being considered this spring also come with budget implications, and many may be off the table for now, according to Harmon.

Lawmakers are continuing to work toward a funding solution to cover a $771 million funding gap for Chicago-area public transportation agencies in 2026. Despite being close to agreements on reforms for the agencies, funding remains undecided.

Harmon suggested that people using the roadways rather than public transit could be a key funding source, while Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, who leads public transit talks in the House, said lawmakers are continuing to look at all options to close the gap.

Pension reform has also been discussed to improve benefits for public employees who entered the system since 2011 and fix compliance with Social Security law.

“All of the solutions, however, require more money, and this is a year when we just don't have much more money,” Harmon said. “So I expect some of those conversations to continue into the summer.”

The same is true for changing how colleges and universities are funded. Lawmakers have held hearings on a plan that would prioritize funding to universities not receiving an adequate level of funding based on a mathematical formula.

“I don't see the requisite amount of money being driven into higher education funding formulas to achieve the outcome this year,” Harmon said.

Pritzker has said he will not look at major tax hikes to balance the budget and asked lawmakers in February to come up with corresponding cuts for any new spending they want. He also proposed about $400 million in tax changes to balance the budget.

But as progressive groups rallied in the capitol Thursday in favor of $6 billion of tax increases they want lawmakers to consider, Republicans feared Democrats will be tempted to tap into taxpayers to fund larger spending increases. House Democrats reviewed possible tax increases in a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon.

“The legislature has a great track record of using this time, squandering time for many months, and using the waning hours of the legislative session to enact gigantic changes that have real world consequences for taxpayers,” Spain told reporters.

Republicans hope Pritzker exercises caution.

“I know the governor in our first conversations before the budget address, when we sat down together, he wasn't celebrating,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told reporters. “He knew that this was going to be a tough year, and it's going to continue to get tough as we go forward.”

The budget is typically unveiled publicly a day or two before lawmakers leave Springfield for the year, meaning more details about spending and tax plans won’t be available likely until at least Thursday.

“Less than 10 days out, it’s exactly where you’d expect to be: more questions than answers,” Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, told Capitol News Illinois.

Allen's home in Bayou Dularge on Sept. 12, 2024, one day after Hurricane Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)As hurricane season begins June 1, new studies point to an increasing risk of loss from severe wind and water damage common during these intense storms.
Published in the Society for Risk Analysis’ journal, a study by University of Illinois researcher and civil engineer Eun Jeong Cha predicts the risk of loss from hurricane-related winds could increase up to 76% as soon as 2060 for states in the Southeast, including Louisiana.
“These states experience the highest hurricane activity and associated wind-related losses in the U.S.,” Cha said in a news release. “They represent a critical region for understanding how climate change may alter hurricane risk.”
While much of the damage from storms is caused by water, over 40% of residential storm-related losses from hurricanes are attributed to heavy winds, costing the U.S. economy an expected $14 billion annually, according to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report. 
Cha and her colleague, Chi-Ying Lin, used artificial intelligence to simulate a “worst-case” scenario of how a hurricane – supercharged by warming oceans and global climate change – would affect a single family wood-framed home with concrete masonry. 
“We view it as a stress-test scenario for hurricane wind risk,” Cha said, explaining the worst-case scenario can help communities prepare for the most severe storm, even if reality is less impactful.
Her model is based on a predicted future with maximum fossil fuel emissions and no policy to mitigate the effects of climate change, as detailed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations offshoot. The scenario would see an increase in the global average temperature of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2065. 
Over time, the hurricane damage risk increases even more, with a 102% higher chance of storm-related loss in 2100 should the global average temperature increase the anticipated 6.7 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Cha said studies like hers do more than just spread alarm and awareness. Understanding how future risk increases can help experts understand how to build resiliency into communities, “providing valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and the insurance industry.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Home-damage-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

(John Gray/Verite News)A bill requiring local governments to enforce a ban on sleeping on public property passed through a Louisiana legislative committee Wednesday within the hearing’s final minutes, though housing advocates and groups that serve the homeless say it remains problematic in its current form.  
The proposal, House Bill 619 by Rep. Alonzo Knox, D-New Orleans, would direct local governments to enforce a ban on “public camping” or face possible lawsuits. Local governments could instead designate government-sanctioned encampments – much like the recent state-operated “Transition Center” in New Orleans – in areas where they wouldn’t “materially affect the property value” of homes or businesses.
Any resident or business within 1,000 feet of an illegal public camp, as well as a local district attorney, would be able to sue local governments if they failed to enforce the ban. 
Knox’s bill also requires homeless service providers who receive state funds to provide detailed documentation of their work to municipalities upon request or else lose their funding. Unity of Greater New Orleans, the leading nonprofit serving the city’s homeless population, has drawn scrutiny from Knox and others for not providing more specific data on how it spends federal dollars.

Knox has repeatedly accused housing nonprofits of waste and decried the “homeless industrial complex.” He pushed for the legislative audit of New Orleans’ Continuum of Care providers earlier this year. It found that the city and Unity spent $216 million between 2019-24, with the majority of funds going toward permanent supportive housing.
The audit also found that shelters need better oversight to ensure they’re meeting minimum health and safety standards. 
When Knox’s measure was brought up Wednesday in the House Committee on Health and Welfare, it was after hearings on two other bills spanned more than three hours. Chairman Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, noted that 11 people wanted to speak against Knox’s bill but wouldn’t have time because the House had already convened on the floor. 
Committee members were given the option to defer Knox’s bill until next week but chose instead to continue the meeting. With limited time, Miller limited the opposition to just three speakers. Two attendees who’ve experienced homelessness were among those who didn’t have the chance to speak.
Knox agreed to amendments suggested by Rep Chris Turner, R-Ruston, which included changes in how the bill defines dwelling structures and extended the timeline for encampment clearing notices. Committee members suggested that the amendments should remove opposition to the bill.
But opponents said the amendments did not allay their concerns, and in some cases even increased the risk of harm. 
‘Serious legal and ethical conflicts’
The state-sanctioned encampments proposed in Knox’s bill parallel Gov. Jeff Landry’s recent transition center in New Orleans, set up at a warehouse in a remote industrial section of the city. Unsheltered people were taken there from encampments downtown just before the Super Bowl. 
Knox toured and praised the site while it was open, but his bill has sparked questions about how money for housing can be spent most efficiently.
Landry’s transition center, which cost about $17 million, ultimately placed 108 people in permanent supportive housing. Since 2023, Unity of Greater New Orleans has spent $2.3 million to permanently house 275 people, according to the audit.
The state spent about $100,000 per person on the warehouse site over 10 weeks, compared to the $20,000 per year it costs to provide housing and support services per person, said Angela Owczarek with the Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a housing rights advocacy.
A pandemic-era emergency rental assistance program, which ended last year, cost about $3,000 per New Orleans household to prevent homelessness for those facing eviction, Owczarek said. 
Elsa Dimitradis, executive director of Acadiana Regional Coalition on Homelessness and Housing, testified that she had “serious concerns” about Knox’s bill, particularly the mandate about sharing client information with local governments. She warned the potential violations of privacy and disability laws could jeopardize $93 million in federal funding for housing nonprofits across the state. 
Unity of Greater New Orleans is already suing the state for trying to compel the organization to produce protected information about its clients, such as medical histories and Social Security numbers. 
Dimitradis also testified that the bill as written “appears to allow for open-ended demands at any time without clear standards or limitations,” which is “an operational threat.”
Hannah Adams of the National Housing Law Project argued the bill should provide exceptions to the ban if local governments are actively working to rehouse people. 
“Clearing an encampment when social workers are actively working to rehouse individuals does interfere with their ability to maintain contact and secure long-term housing for their clients,” Adams told the committee. 
The audit, likewise, noted that unexpected NOPD sweeps and state pressure to clear encampments contributed to delays in the city’s rehousing efforts.
Monique Blossom, director of policy at Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, also warned that by directing state officials to inspect group homes, the bill risks violating the federal Fair Housing Act, opening the state to liability. The bill could lead to the shuttering of some group homes, including domestic violence shelters, sober living homes and even homes for seriously ill children who need to stay near hospitals, she said
Donna Paramore, executive director of the Travelers Aid Society of Greater New Orleans, told Illuminator the group is in “strong opposition” to the bill despite the amendments. 
“The framework it proposes still undermines essential safeguards for vulnerable populations,” Paramore said. The issues outlined by Dimitradis “could jeopardize federal funding” and “create serious legal and ethical conflicts,” she added. 
Paramore also noted her nonprofit undergoes an independent financial audit each year and has never had an adverse finding. She said that instead of banning public encampments, the state should expand supportive housing, behavioral health services and trauma-informed care.
Knox dismissed objections at the close of the hearing, calling some “technical and nitpicking.” He rejected Adams’ request for leniency when social workers are actively working on rehousing someone.
“If that language were to be included, they will always be ‘actively working,’” Knox said. 
The representative’s office did not respond to a request for comment after hearing.

Emily Votruba’s love of animals was sparked early, during childhood summers at her grandma’s cottage on Old Mission Peninsula.
She’d watch frogs in the nearby pond and worry about how ultraviolet radiation from the hole in the ozone would harm them.
But when she moved back to Michigan in 2010, she started thinking about turtles.
After living in New York City for over a decade, she wasn’t used to driving. Here, she was confronted with a lot of roadkill.

Roads across the country have diced up habitats, devastating animal populations and their ecosystems.
Driving on those roads, it can be almost impossible to avoid sprinting deer or scurrying squirrels. But turtles are, well, slow. And to Votruba, it seemed they were unnecessary casualties in the otherwise unavoidable collisions between cars and wildlife.
“I saw one right on [M-22] in the village that had just been run over in the middle of the road and was still there,” she said of a sighting a few years ago. “I’m pretty sure it was still alive. It had a cracked shell, was mostly crushed, but was not dead yet.”
In the village of Elberta, the speed limit is 30 miles per hour or less, but Votruba said people often go faster. And there are sections of Elberta’s roads that are especially dangerous, like a bend on M-22 near the Betsie Valley Trail.
“Coming around that corner, it would be so easy to just hurt a turtle (or) hurt a person who was trying to help them,” she said.
So Votruba got together with fellow county residents Mark and Carol Carlin to do something about it. The Carlins own The Elberta Mercantile Co. and are also DJs at the community radio station WUWU 100.1 FM.
Motivating them was “a combination of traffic safety and turtle safety coming together, and also being concerned about the people like us who like to help turtles,” she said.
The grassroots group held the first Turtlefest last year.
People made turtle crossing signs to post at key areas. They also worked with the Michigan Department of Transportation to install an official turtle crossing sign in that area. The signs go up at the start of turtle crossing season in the spring and come down around the end of July. The Portage Lake Watershed Association and the Benzie Conservation District have also put up signs at some key crossing locations.


Turtlefest 2025:
Turtlefest takes place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on May 24 at 654 Frankfort Ave. in downtown Elberta. You can expect sign painting, food for sale and more. It’s free to attend.


Michigan is home to 10 turtle species; three are threatened within the state according to the state Department of Natural Resources: the wood turtle, the spotted turtle, and the eastern box turtle. One — the Blanding’s turtle — is of special concern.
A recent DNR newsletter outlined the dangers of the road for these reptiles. Turtle eggs and young face high predation, but as they get older their survival rate increases drastically, so their conservation depends heavily on adult survival, wrote state fisheries biologist Tom Goniea.
Turtles are on the move in the spring and summer. Females look for nesting sites and males “just kind of wander this time of year,” Goniea wrote, asking drivers to slow down and keep an eye out for the reptilian travelers.
Since the signs went up last year, Votruba said, many people have told her they’re excited to see more awareness around the issue.
“I think a lot of people feel like they’re the only one who cares,” she said, and knowing they’re not alone in that feeling is powerful. “If that message gets out there, then maybe it makes it safer for everyone who’s interested in helping the turtles.”

How to help turtles

Stay alert around bridge crossings and roads near water
If you see a turtle in the road, slow down and try to avoid hitting it if it’s possible to do so safely
If you decide to help a turtle cross the road and it’s safe to do so, move the turtle in the direction its head is pointing — it knows where it wants to go
Be gentle with the turtle, don’t pick it up by its tail
If a turtle is on the side of the road, make sure it’s not digging a nest for eggs before trying to move it
Unless the turtle is in immediate danger, leave it alone",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Community-turtle-crossing-sign.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a measure (SB 472) that ensures that credits earned from prison-based classes count toward professional licensing, providing more opportunities for the formerly incarcerated to become self-sufficient.
The Correctional Education Program (CEP) within the Department of Corrections provides educational programming to inmates. The CEP provides 92 career and technical education courses in 37 vocational trades that are aligned to Florida’s in-demand occupations, including barbering, cosmetology, electrical contracting, landscaping, plumbing, and HVAC contracting, according to a bill analysis.
The CEP has awarded 36,689 certificates and industry-recognized credentials over the last four years. However, these certificates were largely only valid while the people receiving them were incarcerated, and they are not recognized outside of prison, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
“The measure signed [Thursday] will help remedy that by ensuring that credits earned from prison-based classes are recognized and counted toward professional licensing requirements,” said institute CEO Sadaf Knight in a statement. “Additionally, common-sense reforms like this one that bolster workforce opportunities for returning citizens can save taxpayer dollars spent on incarceration costs by reducing the rate of recidivism.”
The measure requires the Department of Corrections, in coordination with applicable licensing boards within the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR), or DBPR when there isn’t a board, to design a program that ensures credits earned from prison classes are recognized and counted toward professional licensing requirements.
The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow and in the House by Miami-Dade Democrat Kevin Chambliss and Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“The most important factor for reformed individuals in preventing recidivism is employment upon one’s release from prison,” said Chambliss in a statement. “For inmates that have shown that they wish to be productive members of society upon the completion of their sentence, the state has a responsibility to make their transition as smooth as possible.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 17:17:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Will CT lawmakers expand parole eligibility?,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-parole-eligibility-expansion/,Current law makes parole available to certain individuals — but only for sentences rendered before October 2005. A bill would change that.,"This story has been updated.
Advocates, family members and friends of incarcerated individuals say it’s critical that a bill expanding eligibility for parole — the early release from prison under supervision and with certain conditions — be approved through by the Connecticut legislature before its 2025 session ends in two weeks. 
Current law allows those who have been convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 and 21 to become eligible for parole after serving a portion of their sentence. People sentenced to less than 50 years may become eligible for parole after serving either 12 years or 60% of their sentence. People sentenced to more than 50 years reach eligibility after 30 years in prison. 
That only applies to crimes for which the perpetrator was sentenced before October 1, 2005. The proposed bill would extend eligibility to individuals who committed crimes between the ages of 18 and 21 on any date up to the present day. 
The bill passed through the legislature’s Judiciary Committee last month and it awaits debate in the House of Representatives. House Democratic leaders told reporters that lawmakers intend to take up the bill for debate, but that they were not sure when. The legislature’s 2025 session ends June 4.
Majority leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, told The Connecticut Mirror Thursday that the delay wasn’t over political disagreement; rather, caucus leaders were still determining which bills they wanted to prioritize. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he didn’t expect he would be in support of the bill, but he said he couldn’t say for sure until he’d seen it.
For families of incarcerated people, the legislature’s decision can’t come soon enough.
Nicole Spears, who grew up in Meriden, told CT Mirror that the proposed legislation would help her brother, Robert Marrow. Marrow was incarcerated for a crime he committed at the age of 20, and he was sentenced in 2006. That makes him ineligible for parole under current law. 
Spears said her brother fell in with the “wrong crowd” after their parents passed away. Marrow was fourteen when their mother died from a long illness, and their father had a fatal heart attack one year later. 
“ My father died in his arms,” she said of Marrow. “They were traveling and he died at a rest stop, and my little brother was with him. It’s just, I think, hard to take,” she said. 
Spears said it’s been difficult to visit her brother at times. They’ve kept in touch through letters and phone calls, and sometimes she sends money or packages. Spears said she brought her daughter, who is now 26, to visit as a small child, but her younger son has never met his uncle.
Personal impacts
Elizabeth Hinton, a professor of history, African American studies and law at Yale, said addressing sentencing policy was key to correcting racial disparities in the criminal justice system. She estimated that about 258 people would become eligible for parole if the bill passes, 166 of whom are Black.
Hinton said she hoped Connecticut would follow the model established in California, where people who committed a crime between the ages of 18 and 25 can apply for parole at certain intervals during their incarceration. 
Hinton said granting eligibility for parole wouldn’t automatically mean people’s sentences would be reduced or that they’d be released early. Incarcerated people would still have to go before the parole board, which makes final decisions on whether to approve people for parole. 
Expanding the parole program also has positive financial impacts for the state and local communities, Hinton added. “The amount of money that Connecticut taxpayers will save is huge. If we keep all of those people in for their full sentences, that’s going to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars overtime,” she said. 
Hinton recommended that the state consider how it might redirect those funds into things like education, housing access and expanded job opportunities.
Several Republican lawmakers, along with Connecticut’s Office of the Victim Advocate, opposed the bill.
Natasha Pierre, the state’s victim advocate, argued in testimony to the legislature’s Judiciary Committee in March that the state should conduct a 10-year study on the fallout of its recent criminal justice reforms before further opening up parole options. 
“Reform strategies should serve not only public safety and the interests of the accused; but must serve those personally harmed by crime. The ever-changing sentencing landscape in criminal cases has had and will continue to have a detrimental impact of victims of crime,” she said in written testimony. 
Many incarcerated individuals who submitted testimony in favor of the bill said that once they were incarcerated, they began taking steps to improve their lives. They took college courses and earned degrees and certifications, became involved in Alternative to Violence programs and other rehabilitative programs, and they mentored others in the prison. 
“Neighborhood notoriety is something that most kids in urban environments seek and will do abnormal things to receive. I was too immature and blind to identify any potential in myself and that made it easy for the wrong person with influence to guide me,” wrote Patrick Young, who was incarcerated at the age of 20 for assault with a sentence of 31 years. 
Maurice Blackwell, who was incarcerated for a murder he committed at age 19, was sentenced in 2002 to 60 years in prison. Under current law, he became eligible for parole and was recently released. 
Blackwell told CT Mirror that when his father died in 2003, it was an “eyeopener” for him, and he began taking advantage of more of the resources available to him in prison. He became part of the first cohort of the Yale Prison Education Initiative, which offers college classes to incarcerated individuals. He’s now a student at the University of New Haven, and says he plans to pursue a law degree.
“I thought I was a man, when I was younger,” Blackwell said, adding that his perception has changed. “I was still a child.”

Brandi Bradley speaks on the Colorado House floor during the last day of the 2025 legislative session, May 7, at the Colorado Capitol. Bradley is a vocal opponent of House Bill 25-1312's transgender protections. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Of all the bills introduced this year at the Colorado Capitol, one came to define the legislative session for much of the right in Colorado. Even now that the session is over and the bill has become law, it is taking on new life as opponents exercise their outrage in schoolyard-bully social media posts, depraved sermons and a legal challenge in federal court.
The legislation, House Bill 25-1312, enacted several new protections for transgender people. Though the law was a reasonable response to escalating attacks against a besieged segment of the population, especially since the start of the Trump administration and its extreme anti-trans bias, the backlash it prompted is disproportionate, sinister and full of misinformation.
The first thing to understand about the trans rights law is that, while it contains several technical passages and underwent extensive debate and revision, the source of opposition to it has very little to do with the bill’s actual provisions. It’s about hate. It’s about bigotry against transgender people.
That’s all.

Opponents have become adept at advancing talking points that might sound superficially plausible — rhetoric about threats to women in sports, supposed adverse medical outcomes to minors who transition, parental rights infringements — but these arguments have the inconvenient quality of withering under evidence and counterpoints, and, worse, they’re a cover for the ultimate justification bigots use for discrimination against trans people: Christian scripture.
Many of the most virulent activists against the law have ties to or are pastors at politically right-wing churches. They justify every other point of opposition by their interpretation of the Bible, which in their reading says trans people are dangerous and beset by evil. Opposition to the law is simply a repugnant form of Christian sanctimony that serves little more than hate of a very recognizably human kind.
Many of the most contested provisions of the bill were amended out of the final version, yet some anti-trans activists continue to allude to those passages as part of their denunciations. View with extreme skepticism any criticism that discusses whether anti-trans parents could be disadvantaged in child custody cases or a shield provision against anti-trans laws in other states. Language around those issues were in the bill at one time but later stripped.










If they see me get frustrated and angry, they'll just use it against me. I can't let them ... I can't show any kinks in the armor, so to speak, because otherwise they'll try to slay me, and I can't let that happen.


– State Rep. Brianna Titone


The provision of the governor-signed HB-1312 that has drawn the most negative attention boosts anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.
Republican state Rep. Brandi Bradley in a social media post and video after passage of the bill told her audience that anti-trans parents could lose custody of their trans children if they discriminate against them, that private schools, churches and other places of public accommodation could be sued for anti-trans discrimination, and that there’s no telling when someone deadnames or misgenders a trans person at what threshold discrimination liability kicks in.
This is all misleading. CADA has always prohibited discrimination and harassment against certain protected classes, and the protected classes have always included “gender identity” and “gender expression.” All HB-1312 does is clarify that gender expression could involve a “chosen name” and pronouns.
“Their claim that it’s now illegal is false,” state Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat who sponsored the bill, told Newsline this week. “It’s always been illegal.”
And it’s fearmongering to suggest that someone is liable to a discrimination allegation the moment they misgender or deadname someone. CADA covers particular settings, including employment, housing, and places of public accommodation. Churches and other places used for religious purposes are excluded. Incidental or accidental acts do not qualify as discrimination.
“Within CADA already, it’s already like discrimination has to be intentional,” García said. “So the fact that this is just being wrapped into gender identity, we’re not changing the threshold of when something is actually considered discrimination.”
But discrimination, it turns out, is exactly what some of the most outspoken 1312 critics intend. Many are Christian leaders and pastors, including Jeff Hunt, conservative radio host and former director of the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University; Chris Goble of Ridgeline Community Church in Castle Rock; J. Chase Davis of The Well Church in Boulder; and Aaron Carlson of New City Church in Highlands Ranch. Each one of these bullies has singled out state Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat who is the first transgender woman to serve in the Colorado Legislature, to intentionally deadname and misgender her.
The only plaintiff named as an individual in the lawsuit against HB-1312 is Travis Morrell, a Grand Junction dermatologist who online broadcasts faith-based motivations. A social media account called Fight1312 has become a primary source of anti-trans sentiment. Its posts make it clear that behind every variety of opposition to transgender rights is essentially one complaint, that God, as conceived by 1312’s opponents, commands them to hate transgender people.
“Our good God does not make mistakes,” Goble said in a video of a recent sermon, facing the camera and addressing Titone directly. He aggressively misgendered her and called on her to “repent.”
Titone herself detects an additional motivation among anti-trans activists, noting there have been other episodes throughout history when transgender people faced persecution.
“The big difference now, because of all the social media and everything else, they’re making money off of it,” she said. “So it’s not just finding an enemy and a scapegoat you can pick on, to gang up on and get people to come along with you for the kicking fest, but they’re actually making money off of it.”
But hate does real harm.
“Kids are scared,” Titone said. “I’ve heard from kids. They’re like, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m afraid my grandfather’s not going to like who I am and they’re going to not want to talk to me anymore.'”
Her own response to bigots is public poise, legislative fortitude and personal resilience.
“If they see me get frustrated and angry, they’ll just use it against me. I can’t let them,” she said. “I can’t show any kinks in the armor, so to speak, because otherwise they’ll try to slay me, and I can’t let that happen.”

A legislative panel will mull statutory changes to protect TerraPower's Natrium security force from civil liability, including when using lethal force.
The post Wyoming nuclear developer wants legal protections for private, armed security force appeared first on WyoFile .","Don’t mess around at a nuclear power plant facility. If you have no business there but insert yourself anyway, you will be met with armed guards who are directed to “detect, assess, interdict and neutralize” all threats — including with lethal force.
Use of force in securing such facilities, including TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer, is required by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to agency officials. So are a litany of other security measures to ensure the sensitive operations don’t fall prey to “nuclear sabotage” — among the highest threats to U.S. national security, they say.
Trained security guards must assume that “adversaries would be dedicated and willing to exhibit lethal force and, quite frankly, receive lethal force in return,” NRC Regional State Liaison Officer Ryan Alexander told members of the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee on Thursday in Casper. 
TerraPower officials, who will use a highly enriched uranium fuel to power an “advanced” nuclear reactor, presented a draft bill, “Wyoming Security,” to the committee. They’re asking lawmakers to extend protections against civil lawsuits to a private security force, which the company will be required to install when it begins handling nuclear materials. In addition to describing potential statutory changes to accommodate lawful “use of force” by private security guards and related civil protections, the measure refers to standard NRC security requirements and what would be considered criminal trespass.

“Wyoming law currently lacks clear legal authority for trained security personnel performing these duties without such [legal] protection,” TerraPower Nuclear Security Manager Melissa Darlington testified. Without expressed legal protection, TerraPower would still be held to federal NRC standards of security enforcement, she added, which “may result in hesitancy [upon private security personnel] in implementing their duties.”
The committee directed the Legislative Service Office to work up draft legislation based on TerraPower’s proposed language, and agreed to continue discussion at its next hearing in July.
Though most committee members spoke in support of rigorous security — among the primary concerns they’ve heard from constituents regarding Natrium and other potential nuclear facilities — they want to avoid unintended consequences. Such civil liability protections, for example, should not extend to private security guards while not on duty at the nuclear plant, Laramie Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss suggested.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County.”Shane Johnson, Lincoln County Sheriff
“We have to explore, a little bit, how Wyoming statute [currently applies to] use of lethal force if you are not law enforcement,” he said. “We don’t typically grant civilians the right to lethal force, and particularly when they’re not representing the state or the community, [but] they’re representing a corporation.”
NRC officials admitted it’s a “delicate situation” for each state that hosts nuclear facilities.
“These protections are not unlimited,” said Darlington, who noted she will move to Kemmerer this summer to help oversee security at the Natrium plant. “They only apply to security personnel at commercial nuclear facility sites who are acting with reasonable belief and within the scope of their employment.”
Though some communities opt to train local law enforcement to qualify in on-site security efforts, that’s not likely to be the case in Lincoln County, according to TerraPower and local officials. Law enforcement will work closely with the company and NRC to coordinate emergency responses, said Lincoln County Sheriff Shane Johnson. But local agencies simply don’t have the resources or expertise to take on federal nuclear security.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County,” Johnson told the panel.
Several committee members expressed anxiety over providing civil liability protections to a private, corporate security force. Rothfuss suggested the committee should consider forming a special task force to explore the issue.
“When we’re writing statute, we don’t want to provide somebody who’s an armed-nuclear-security guard the authority to use deadly force on the other side of town,” he said.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.

It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”

Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Two Montana men foraging for mushrooms in the north-central part of the state shot and killed a grizzly bear on May 21, after it reportedly charged them at close range.
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the two men were not harmed during the encounter.
The two local landowners were picking mushrooms about a mile north of Choteau on Wednesday evening when they came across the adult female grizzly bear, which charged them. The men shot and killed the bear at close range.
“I spoke to John and Justin shortly after the incident and they were both still shook up,” Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Director Christy Clark said in a press release. “They told me their story and it was clear it was very traumatic. What’s important here is they’re OK.”
FWP officials said the female grizzly killed had a cub of the year with her at the time of the encounter, and the agency is attempting to capture the cub.
This is the fourth known grizzly bear mortality in 2025, according to FWP’s grizzly mortality dashboard, and the second grizzly death in Teton County this spring. The other mortality in Teton County is listed as under investigation, but FWP at the time described it as self defense.
The dashboard was launched last year to help the agency increase transparency and educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected. Earlier this year, the federal government rejected petitions from Montana and Wyoming officials seeking to delist the species and return them to state management, a proposal that is likely to gain traction under the Trump administration.
Bears are active along the Rocky Mountain Front and in areas around towns like Choteau, Ulm and Cascade. If you are experiencing conflicts with bears, please call your local FWP bear specialist. You can locate their contact information here.

(Courtesy of Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump this week approved a federal disaster declaration for mid-March winter storms in Nebraska with damage estimates exceeding $64 million.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced that Trump had signed the April 11 request this week. The federal declaration, the first request from Pillen in 2025 and his first under Trump, opens federal funding to cover damage costs in 27 counties. Much of the damage resulted from downed electrical lines and damaged utility poles — more than 1,700 poles were downed or destroyed. 
Major roadways closed due to the storm — producing thunderstorms, sleet, high winds and blizzard conditions — including a 160-mile stretch of Interstate 80.

An estimated 200,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm, and some communities established emergency shelters to help those without electricity for a prolonged time.
Pillen had written to Trump that it was “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history” and that “emergency services were pushed to their limits.” 
“I appreciate President Trump’s attention to Nebraska and his approval of this disaster request,” Pillen said in a statement. “Federal funding will help cover the tremendous costs that were incurred as a result of this weather event.”
It’s not uncommon for some disaster declarations to be denied, but with some calls to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether, including from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, some national and state leaders had expressed concern. 
A spokesman for the National Security Council previously said states had to take on a more extensive role in emergency preparedness, including “an appetite to own the problem.”
Some local officials have told the Nebraska Examiner that if Trump had denied the Nebraska request, the costs could have fallen back on local property taxes.

Trump approved the request for 27 counties: Boone, Burt, Butler, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Hamilton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Otoe, Platte, Polk, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Washington, Webster and York.
Pillen’s office said the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency has begun working with local emergency managers and public entities now eligible for assistance, including public utilities.
In 2024, under President Joe Biden, Pillen requested and was granted five federal disasters as he expressed a greater willingness to seek federal funding than his predecessors. Those declarations opened up $120 million in estimated preliminary damage costs for Nebraska.
Pillen this year also signed a state-level disaster declaration in February for wildfires in Custer and Dawes County and in April for a prescribed burn that got out of control in north-central Nebraska. He did not file a corresponding federal disaster request for either.

SPRINGFIELD – A bill unanimously passed by the Senate on Thursday and on its way to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk will increase the age that senior drivers in Illinois are required to take an annual driver’s test.

Currently, if a driver renews their driver’s license between the ages of 79 and 80, they are required to take a driving test. Drivers between 81 and 86 are required to take a driving test every two years, and drivers 87 and older have to take the test annually.

If Pritzker signs House Bill 1226, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, only drivers 87 and older will have to take an annual driver’s test. Illinois drivers between 79 and 86 won’t be required to take a driver’s test to renew their license; instead, they’ll only have to take a vision test, and if they have a driving violation, a written test.

The bill would also allow a spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling or child of any Illinois driver to submit medical information about the driver to the secretary of state if they think the person’s medical condition interferes with their driving abilities. Currently, only medical officials, police officers and state’s attorneys can submit such information.

HB 1226, also called the Road Safety and Fairness Act, has garnered bipartisan support. Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced his support for the bill in January alongside lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. The bill was conceived by a constituent of Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, last year.

The bill has 86 cosponsors in the House and 35 in the Senate.

Illinois is the only state that requires seniors to pass a driving test solely due to their age. But state data indicates that older drivers tend to have lower crash rates.

In 2023, the crash rate for drivers aged 75 and older was 24.61 per 1,000 drivers, which was lower than any other age group, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. The low crash rate has been consistent since at least 2018, according to the Secretary of State’s Office’s 2023 Study on Age-Related Driving Abilities.

The crash rate is more than double for many of the other age groups.

Tate Reeves a proposed budget for approval. 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said separately that they have reached a handshake deal on a $7 billion state budget, which was supposed to have been passed earlier this year in regular session. 
Still, Reeves will ultimately have to give sign-off on it and order a special legislative session before all 174 lawmakers can consider it. 
Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, told Mississippi Today in a statement that: “The House and Senate have come to an agreement on the budget. We have notified the Governor and are awaiting the call for special session.”
White gave a similar account on SuperTalk radio station this week and predicted lawmakers will vote on the budget to fund government services “within the next couple of weeks.” 
Mississippi lawmakers control the purse strings and the budget process. But they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget because of political infighting. Now, legislators must return to the Capitol to pass a budget in a special session before the new budget year begins July 1.
The state Constitution gives the governor the sole power to call a special session, and Reeves alone sets the parameters for what lawmakers can consider in a special session. 
Reeves’ office did not respond to a request for comment on what his criteria will be for approving the budget before he calls the special session. But he told reporters earlier this year at a press conference that he wants legislative leaders to send him a fiscally responsible budget. 
White and Rep. Karl Oliver, a Republican from Winona who serves as a House appropriations chairman, previously said that most state agency budgets will have level funding, with only increases for the public pension system and insurance costs. 
One of the significant points of contention between the two chambers has been how to spend cash not allocated to government operations. Lawmakers typically spend this money on capital projects across the state — including many lawmakers’ pet projects in their districts. 
The Senate wanted to spend only on projects for state agencies, universities and colleges. The House believed there is enough money to fund projects in counties and municipalities around the state, in addition to the state projects. 
The political reality is that legislative leadership tightly controls the bulk of the local projects in what’s often referred to as the “Christmas Tree bill.” Leadership can use these projects to reward people who buy into their agenda and punish members who buck the leadership. 
Such special projects for back home are often a key focus of rank-and-file lawmakers who don’t have prominent leadership roles at the Capitol.

The Mississippi Department of Archives and History helps manage the exhibits of the park, and state money typically flows through the agency. Because the state agency helps manage the area, this was part of the Senate’s justification for the project.
However, the House leadership has apparently balked at the request and views the Senate’s attempt to secure money for the park as an attempt to steer dollars to its favorite project while preventing spending on any pet projects for the House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-23 13:12:41.665246

(Photo courtesy IURC)Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) Chairman Jim Huston announced his retirement Friday and said he plans to step down in January 2026 after more than a decade with the agency.
Although Huston’s second term officially ended April 1, he has remained in the role temporarily — and will continue to do so until a successor is appointed. He was originally named to the commission by Gov. Mike Pence in 2014 and reappointed as chairman by Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2018.
The IURC Nominating Committee is now seeking Huston’s replacement, the commission said in a news release.
“It is with a grateful heart that I announce my intent to retire,” Huston said in a written statement. “It is a blessing to work alongside our incredibly talented professional staff every day, and I am proud of the work we accomplish on behalf of Hoosier families.”

The powerful five-member commission oversees more than 600 electric, natural gas, steam, water and wastewater utilities operating in Indiana, according to its website. It regulates rates, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans and service territories, with final say over changes to the utility bills millions of Hoosiers pay.
During his tenure, Huston worked to streamline agency processes and reinstituted semi-annual “Reliability Forums,” where utility stakeholders assess seasonal preparedness for energy demand.
In 2024, he testified before the U.S. Congress on state-level challenges facing electric service reliability.
Huston currently serves as co-chair of the Federal-State Issues Collaborative, and holds roles with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and GTI Energy.
“I want to thank Chairman Jim Huston for his service with the IURC over the past decade. He is a lifelong public servant and is leaving the agency in much better shape than when he arrived,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “I wish Chairman Huston the best in retirement.”
Prior to his IURC appointment, Huston served as chief of staff at the Indiana State Department of Health. During Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration, he separately served as executive director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The office has since been absorbed by Indiana’s Department of Workforce Development as the agency’s “Serve Indiana” division.
Huston also worked for four members of Congress and former Gov. Robert Orr. He has twice received the Sagamore of the Wabash, one of Indiana’s highest honors.
Huston said he looks looks forward to “the next chapter” of his life, which will include “spending a little more time” with his family and grandchildren.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 16:11:50+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Schools missed learning disabilities of students who were later incarcerated,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/schools-incarcerated-students-report/,A report found CT schools fail to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people who became incarcerated.,"For most of his life, Anthony struggled in school. In first grade, he was held back a year. By middle school, he’d been placed in an alternative school for children with problem behaviors. Then, at age 16, he was incarcerated after being charged with larceny and attempted assault. 
It wasn’t until roughly two years into his stint at Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire that Anthony, whose real name is being withheld for privacy reasons, was identified as having a language and speech impairment.
And he isn’t the only one. 
A report from the Center for Children’s Advocacy, slated to be released this October, found that local school districts repeatedly failed to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people at an early age. That left them vulnerable to disengagement from school, ongoing discipline problems and eventual involvement with the criminal justice system, the report found. 
CCA reviewed the special education records of 10 young men incarcerated at Manson — including Anthony — and found that most of them had experienced learning difficulties in elementary school. Yet it sometimes took years for them to be evaluated for special education services.
And while six of the 10 young people were eventually referred for special education services, most of them were already incarcerated by the time that happened. 
“What jumps out so much from these stories … is how much could have been done for these kids at a much earlier age. Because we are losing them by sixth grade, if not earlier,” Sarah Eagan, CCA’s executive director, told the state General Assembly’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee during a presentation about the report last week.
Andrius Banevicius, public information officer for the Department of Correction, said in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that most young people who come into a DOC facility have already been identified as special needs, and that there are “well established protocols and procedures to refer students to the special education process.”
“The dedicated educational professionals of the department’s Unified School District (USD) #1 are committed to providing a supportive and effective learning environment for all of their students, especially those with special education needs,” said Banevicius.
According to the report, all 10 of the young people whose records the agency reviewed were reading below grade level. Four of them were held back a grade. One was held back three times. 
Andrea Spencer, an education consultant for CCA, said traumatic events “have a significant effect” on a child’s brain development. All of the young people were in some way affected by violence — ranging from experiencing child abuse to witnessing domestic violence or violence in the community. One was the victim of a gunshot. 
Yet in eight of the 10 cases, there was no documentation in their education records about the difficulties they experienced. Eight of the 10 students also had notes in their records indicating that they had difficulties paying attention. 
“It seems that nobody really made the connection between the backgrounds of trauma of these young men and the hypervigilance that comes with that,” Spencer said at the meeting. 
She added that the behaviors children exhibited after experiencing trauma sometimes resemble ADHD. Language difficulties were also a common thread among the young men, which Spencer said was linked to “problem behavior.” 
Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. A 2020 study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that young people with developmental language disorder were more than twice as likely to reoffend.
Spencer said that difficulties with reading reinforced a belief that these students couldn’t function in school settings. As they entered higher grades, where learning relies more on reading texts, they experience heightened stress. 
Being expelled or suspended multiple times and being sent to an alternative school for children with behavioral problems were common stories for the young people whose records the agency reviewed. 
Eight out of 10 were arrested before the start of high school. Four were incarcerated before ninth grade. 
Leo, another of the young men at Manson whose name was changed to protect his privacy, was expelled in seventh grade after getting into a fight with another student in the cafeteria. He didn’t go to school at all for a year. After that, he repeated seventh grade, then stopped going to school until he landed in juvenile detention, according to the report. 
“He had a very significant reading disability, and when he was actually given some instruction, he was identified as diligent, engaged, respectful, by all of his teachers,” Marisa Halm, an attorney with Brown and Patterson LLP who formerly worked with CCA — and directly with some of the young men in the report — said at the meeting.
Falling ‘through the cracks‘
Even when special education needs were identified, the young men weren’t assured of getting the help they needed. According to the report, the special education services they received at Manson were minimal.
Spencer noted that the youths at the facility already had “significant educational deficits” in reading and other areas that were important in order for them to thrive in the community. 
Last August, the federal Department of Justice reached a settlement with the Connecticut Department of Correction after a 2021 federal investigation found, among other things, that Manson Youth Institute was failing to adequately educate children with special education needs. Part of the settlement required the department to screen young men entering the facility for special education needs, create policies around reviewing and revising special education plans and document the services that the youths were receiving. 
Halm told CT Mirror that while DOC was evidently working to improve special education services in response to the settlement, she questioned whether they had enough time to give young people a full school day and the necessary number of staff to provide adequate services.
Spencer added that the youth typically received only about one hour per month in “transition services” — assistance for young people who are preparing to leave the education system and either attend college or enter the workforce. Halm noted that transition services were doubly important for these youth because they were not only leaving the school system, they were also preparing to exit prison and return to their communities. 
DOC’s Banevicius said transition services were offered to every special education student, “which aligns with state and federal mandates.”
Eagan, of CCA, said at the JJPOC meeting that it’s crucial to identify students with learning disabilities at a young age, particularly in schools that she called “feeder districts,” referring to the high proportion of students that end up involved with the criminal justice system. She said those schools — which are primarily in the state’s urban districts — needed resources to give students the support they needed.
The Center for Children’s Advocacy recommended that school districts conduct trauma screenings for students and that the Connecticut Department of Education increase oversight of alternative schools and private special education schools. 
“If we’re not looking under the hood at the programs in a systematic way, these are the kids who are going to fall through the cracks,” Eagan said.
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the Department of Education, said in a statement that the department would consider the findings of the report, but added that there needed to be a broader response to address the challenges students face outside of school.
“As the report states, many of the challenges students face begin well before they enter school and are linked to early childhood adversity that can significantly affect long-term outcomes,” the statement read.
“Addressing these complex issues requires a coordinated, cross-sector response that begins early and extends beyond the school setting,” Cerrone continued. “That said, the Department will continue to examine how these findings may inform its role within the broader system of support for children and families.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-05-23 12:19:42.852937

Nevada Gaming Commissioner Rosa Solis Rainey asked Fontainebleau president Maurice Wooden about the investigation Thursday, catching the executive off guard as he sought licensing as a key employee. 
“With respect to AML (anti-money laundering), tell me about the issues that are currently going on at the Fontainebleau with respect to credit issuance,” Solis-Rainey said to Wooden. “Are you aware of those?”
“I’m not sure of any investigation as it relates to anything with AML. Is there something specific? I’m not sure,” Wooden responded. 
“I think that is something that staff is currently further investigating, prior to any further action,” Gaming Control Board member Chandeni Sendall chimed in. 
“It’s not listed in our materials as confidential, by the way,” noted a visibly irked Gaming Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Togliatti. 
“Is it confidential or not confidential?” Solis-Rainey inquired. “We have in our materials that there’s an investigation ongoing with respect to the credit practices not being followed.”  
The issue, she said, involved ownership approving credit without proper approval from compliance executives. Fontainebleau is owned by Jeffrey Soffer. The $3.7 billion property opened in December 2023.
“If those processes happened, they were certainly before my time. I was, you know, not on property for what I believe some of the questions you’re asking,” Wooden responded, adding he believes “at least one or two of those issues did happen, almost like the opening week.” 
Wooden is likely referring to a $2 million marker issued to gambler and illegal bookmaker Damien LeForbes, shortly after the resort’s opening in December 2023, according to Robert Cipriani, a professional gambler who provided information to the federal government about money laundering at MGM Grand and Resorts World. 
LeForbes and illegal sports bookie Mathew Bowyer have pleaded guilty to operating unlawful gambling businesses and to money laundering. 
MGM Resorts entered into a non-prosection agreement with the government in early 2024 and paid a $7.45 million fine. Its former president, Scott Sibella, agreed to a plea deal for failing to comply with AML regulations. The feds have yet to take any action against Resorts World, where Sibella also served as president until his termination in September of 2023, and where Bowyer and LeForbes were permitted to gamble without known sources of funds.    
The Gaming Commission fined Resorts World $10.5 million in March and imposed an $8.5 million fine against MGM in April. 
Cipriani contends the investigation has expanded to a handful of other resorts, including Fontainebleau.
In early January 2024, weeks after Fontainebleau’s opening, Cipriani tweeted the casino granted a $2 million marker to LeForbes, who eventually “blew thru it all,” according to Cipriani. 
“All the casinos that took DJ Leforbes’ and Matt Bowyer’s action are being investigated by GCB,” Cipriani said Friday.
No efforts have been made by Fontainebleau or Venetian, where the two also gambled, to recover the funds via the District Attorney’s Office, according to court records. 
Gaming Control Board Chairman Kirk Hendrick told Togliatti the information about the investigation, which was included in the Commission’s back up documents, should have been marked confidential.
“I don’t want to go any deeper into this matter until the board has an opportunity to review it and, of course, speak with the licensee,” he said.
Stacy Michaels, a Fontainebleau executive, said the GCB audited five player accounts and had concerns with three. Michaels added that agents were eventually satisfied the company had followed proper protocol.

Vasquez's office)The Republican reconciliation bill that cleared the United States House of Representatives by a narrow margin this week no longer authorizes the sale of thousands acres of public land in Utah and Nevada.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), who co-founded the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus earlier this year, said the removal of that provision represents a “huge victory” for all Americans concerned about public lands being sold to the highest bidder. Vasquez said in a statement he started the caucus with U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Montana Republican, to beat back these attacks on public lands. 
“We committed to working across party lines to sit down and ensure the integrity of our land management system. We’ve worked together across the aisle to prevent this unprecedented public lands sell-off,” Vasquez said. “We will continue to work together to ensure our lands are public, accessible and well managed.”

The provision would have gutted protections for 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation, according to New Mexico Wild, a conservation advocacy group. That could have meant the lands were turned into “golf courses, luxury resorts or strip malls,” the group said in a statement Thursday. 
Environmental groups nationally have applauded the removal of the provision, which Reps. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) and Mark Amodei (R-Nevada) sponsored. New Mexico Wild’s executive director Mark Allison said the bipartisan pushback was a factor in maintaining the land’s protections, but he warned that this is the first of many fights in coming days to stave off efforts to privatize public lands.
“The fact that House Republicans were forced to retreat shows that when we unite to defend our birthright, politicians listen,” he said in a statement. “But make no mistake — this fight is far from over. The same forces that tried to sneak this land grab through would love nothing more than to come after New Mexico’s public lands next time.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill that would eliminate certain transgender protections established by a 2018 anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire was approved by the state Senate Thursday and now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
​​If it becomes law, House Bill 148, which was sponsored by Wilton Republican Rep. Jim Kofalt, will allow businesses and organizations in New Hampshire to classify certain services, such as locker rooms and restrooms, by biological sex. It would also permit schools and organized sports teams in the state to keep transgender athletes off teams that are consistent with their gender identity. It would allow prisons, mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers to place transgender people with members of their at-birth sex even if they ask to be placed according to the gender they identify with. The bill doesn’t require any of these things, but it allows whoever owns the restrooms, administers the sports teams, or runs the prison to do so without facing discrimination charges. This reverses parts of 2018’s Law Against Discrimination, which was enacted to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, or national origin.”
The Senate passed the bill, 16-8, along party lines Thursday, with all Republicans voting yes and all Democrats voting no. The House passed the legislation, 201-166, in March. Only two Democratic House members, Reps. Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, both of Peterborough, voted in favor.
Ayotte will now have the option to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature. Her predecessor, former Gov. Chris Sununu, was given the same options in 2024 when the House and Senate approved House Bill 396. This year’s bill, HB 148, is a word-for-word copy of last year’s HB 396. Sununu ultimately vetoed the bill, calling it “unacceptable,” and saying it “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves,” per his veto message.

The merits of the state tax cuts and Republicans’ budget decisions have become partisan talking points in the early days of the 2026 campaign, as candidates begin to position themselves to run for governor and other offices.
Here’s a look at some of the key budget decisions lawmakers made this year:
The $9.425 billion budget came in above the $8.5 billion in projected revenue for FY 2026. To finance the difference, lawmakers approved taking an estimated $917 million in funding from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and budget surplus from previous years to fully fund state priorities. In later negotiations, legislators also agreed to use $26 million from the Iowa’s Sports Wagering Fund to provide money for priorities like paraeducator pay and the public safety equipment fund.
The FY 2026 budget will fund the state beginning July 1, 2025. It’s contains $478.1 million more — or 5.34% — than the FY 2025 budget of $8.947 billion.

House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said Iowans should be aware that this year’s budget reflects an unsustainable spending model for the state, as the funds being used to make up for the revenue shortfall are one-time money.
“It’s important that Iowans know that we’re spending on ongoing expenses out of the state savings account, and that that’s not a sustainable way to govern,” Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, told reporters at the end of the 2025 legislative session. “And the reason for that is because Republicans, who have been in charge for 10 years, have been unable to manage this budget in a way that’s truly going to be responsible and actually be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”
The state’s budget — and the factors that led to decreased revenue — are likely to be a major talking point for Democrats heading into the 2026 election season. One of the largest reasons why Iowa’s revenue fell was because of recent cuts to individual and corporate income taxes.
In 2024, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure speeding up previous income tax cuts, which reduced the individual income tax rate from 5.7% in 2024 to a single 3.8% rate beginning in 2025.
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Friday on an episode of “Iowa Press” that Republicans chose to make this cut — knowing that the move would cause a loss in state financial returns — because Iowans had “overpaid” through income taxes in previous years, money that went into the Taxpayer Relief Fund. The Taxpayer Relief Fund holds $4 billion, and that’s just one of the state’s pots of unspent money. There’s also a $2 billion general fund surplus and $961 million in Iowa’s reserve accounts.
“The reason we felt confident in being able to do (tax cuts) is we felt we had an overcollection from Iowans, we needed to get that back into their pockets,” Grassley said. “I think what we’ve done as we approached this, we expected that there may be less revenue coming in, but typically when you cut taxes that is what comes with it. Thankfully, we have those backstops there that were in place for that reason. And, like I said, in a $9.4 billion budget, the state of Iowa is sitting on roughly $7 billion between those accounts that I just touched on. I think that puts us in a very strong position and why we felt confident and still feel confident moving forward.”
He said this funding is being used to “offset any of those bumps in the road” in the implementation of tax cuts, but said Republicans believe the state’s revenue will increase again because the tax cuts will stimulate the Iowa’s economy.
But Democrats said while these savings can be used to make up for current budget shortages, these should not be relied on to meet the state’s spending obligations. Following the March Revenue Estimating Conference, Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, released information from the Iowa Department of Management’s five-year budget projections, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, that found the Reynolds administration’s budget plan for the next five years would continue to draw money from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and Economic Emergency Fund.
“Republicans are breaking their own rule of using one-time funds for ongoing expenses, and Iowa taxpayers are footing the bill,” Petersen said in a statement.
During floor debates on appropriations bills, Democrats repeatedly emphasized the larger problems with the FY 2026 budget, saying the Legislature should not be drawing money from savings and reserves to fund annual expenses. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, criticized Republicans during floor debate on the health and human services budget bill for both irresponsible budgeting practices and for ot providing enough funding to meet Iowans’ needs in their proposal.
“One of the biggest pieces that we have to talk about here is how the majority party’s failed economic policies mean that we don’t have enough revenue to cover this inadequate budget,” Trone Garriott said. “… We could do a lot better for a lot of people, and I’m sorry that we’re not making that effort in this budget.”
Trone Garriott, as well as Konfrst, are running as Democratic candidates in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District in 2026, and have been critical of both state and federal GOP budget practices. Discussions on Iowa’s budget could also play a role in statewide elected races, like in the gubernatorial race. As Reynolds announced that she will not seek reelection, multiple Republicans — including Speaker Grassley — have said they are considering running to become the GOP nominee in 2026.
Though the budget has been approved by lawmakers, the governor still must sign off on the appropriations bills. She has the ability to line-item veto specific funding provisions within these budgets, meaning funding for some of the provisions approved by the legislature could be cut by the governor.
As it stands, here are some of the ways state money is appropriated in the upcoming year’s budget:
Education
An expense that Democratic legislators have repeatedly criticized and pointed to as a place for cuts is the Education Savings Account (ESA) program. It provides state dollars for K-12 students’ private school tuition and associated costs. The program, approved in 2023, has limited Iowans’ eligibility based on income for the first two years of implementation. Beginning the the 2025-2026 school year, families of any income level can receive the public funding for private school costs through the program.
The most recent estimates put ESA spending at $314 million for the upcoming year, a roughly $96 million increase from the current fiscal year.
There is not an appropriations limit for the state program, meaning the estimate could differ from how much is actually spent. The money in ESA accounts is tied to the state’s state supplemental aid (SSA) rate for per-pupil spending for public K-12 schools — $7,988 per student for the upcoming school year.
Lawmakers passed a 2% SSA rate for the FY 2026 budget as part of a total $3.9 billion in spending for the state’s public K-12 school system.
This is not the only money going toward Iowa education in this year’s budget. Senate File 647, the education appropriations bill — separate budget from SSA — allocated more than $1.033 billion. Much of that funding went to Iowa’s higher education institutions, which included a $7.5 million funding increase for the Iowa community colleges and a $5.5 million increase for the Iowa Board of Regents governing the state’s public universities.
Additionally, lawmakers passed Senate File 660, a measure providing $14 million to fund a pay supplement for paraeducators and other educational support staff through the Sports Wagering Fund. This money, one of the hold-ups in budget negotiations between House and Senate Republicans, was a funding component approved in 2024 as part of the law making changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies (AEAs) but was not included in the budget proposal agreed upon between Senate Republicans and Reynolds.
The state’s standing appropriations bill, which contains SSA funding as well as other state spending obligations, also contained a $25 million reduction in funding for AEAs.
Health and human services
Another large piece of state spending was allocated through House File 1049, the state’s health and human services budget. The $2.469 billion appropriations bill funds the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veterans Affairs.
A majority — $1.903 billion — of the spending goes to Medicaid and related state programs, including the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP, providing expanded Medicaid health coverage, and the Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa (Hawki) program for uninsured children of low-income families. This year’s budget included a $230.4 million increase to make up for expected funding shortfalls for Medicaid and Hawki.
Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said during floor debate the state was “fully funding Medicaid” through the bill, but Democrats questioned whether state funding will be sufficient considering Medicaid cuts currently being considered by Congress.
The appropriations measure includes $20 million for nursing facility providers’ Medicaid rate rebasing, higher reimbursements for maternal health providers, and an increase from $50 to $55 in personal needs allowances given to individuals on Medicaid in care facilities each month.
It also includes a restriction on Medicaid coverage, banning payments through the health plan for transgender Iowans seeking physical medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria, such as sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatment therapy. The bill was amended from an earlier version that included language to stop Medicaid coverage for all forms of gender dysphoria treatment, including mental health care.
Democrats still argued the provision was unjust, as it prevented Iowans from receiving lifesaving medical treatment. Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, argued the measure violated the Equal Protections Clause in the U.S. and Iowa constitution, as it would deny a group of people medical treatment that remains accessible to others. Cisgender people could still receive hormone therapy if deemed medically necessary, Donahue said as an example, while transgender people could not.
Medicaid coverage for transition-related treatments was brought up as one of the motivators to remove gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act earlier in the 2025 legislative session. Previous attempts by Republican lawmakers to ban Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans were struck down because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act, and the Iowa Supreme Court has not weighed in on the constitutionality of such a ban.
Another component of health-related spending passed this year was allocation of money from the Opioid Settlement Fund. Lawmakers have failed in previous legislative sessions to pass a bill distributing money from the fund, which currently contains more than $56 million, but were able to get House File 1038 to the governor’s desk in 2025.
The bill appropriates $29 million from the fund to HHS for disbursement to several specific organizations and programs working on addiction prevention, treatment and recovery programs in FY 2026. In future years, money will be allotted from the fund to state agencies, with HHS receiving 75% and the Iowa Attorney General’s office receiving 25%, with these entities then choosing where the money will go. Iowa is expected to receive more than $325 million in the fund between fiscal years 2021 through 2039, according to the AG’s office, with settlement funds split between local governments and the state.
House lawmakers including Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said he was disappointed with some aspects of the measure, but that the compromise was needed or else “we would have gone a third year without using these funds to address opioid abuse in Iowa.” The Opioid Settlement Fund, created in 2022, is money collected by Iowa through lawsuits brought by states against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. A majority of this money, 85%, is obligated through the cases to be spent on opioid addiction treatment and prevention.
Democratic lawmakers said they were frustrated that the Opioid Settlement Fund money will be distributed through HHS and the AG’s office under the agreement, arguing this structure will provide less oversight and input from communities in need, but supported the bill as a means to distribute money.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Justice and judiciary
The combined spending for Iowa’s law enforcement and courts systems came to a total of $924.9 million for FY 2026.
The judicial branch’s budget, Senate File 648, came to $221.83 million. It included $1.27 million more in funding for judicial officer salaries, amounting to a 2.5% pay raise for justices and judges — an increase Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen called for in January to help Iowa be more competitive and help current issues with filling judicial vacancies across the state.
Senate File 644, the budget funding state law enforcement entities including the departments of Justice, Corrections, Public Safety and Homeland Security and Emergency Management, appropriated $703.1 million from the general fund, $20.6 from other funds and several standing appropriations. The budget included a $7.6 million increase for the state Department of Corrections, allocated to several state facilities and department efforts.
It also had a a $2.1 million increase for the Office of the State Public Defender — including a $1.95 million transfer from the Indigent Defense Fund and $100,000 from the College Student Aid Commission designated for the Rural Attorney Recruitment Assistance Program. Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, said the bill includes a total increase of $1.07 million for indigent defense, raising the pay for attorneys who represent people who cannot hire a lawyer themselves by approximately $2 per hour.
Lawmakers also approved adding $150,000 in new money for the victims assistance grant fund, run through the state Attorney General’s office, to provide services for human trafficking victims.
Agriculture and natural resources
The upcoming fiscal year’s funding for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa Department of Natural Resources and related state programs totaled $46.6 million from the general fund, in addition $99.4 million coming from other funds.
Senate File 646 shifts $2.5 million from the existing Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Fund and provides $1.05 million in new funding to create the Iowa Animal Disease Prevention fund, focused on efforts to research vaccines, track outbreaks and provide equipment to treat and prevent animal diseases. This was a change requested by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig following the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
The measure also makes changes to the Choose Iowa program focused on producers that sell food and goods grown in Iowa. It ends the Choose Iowa pilot purchasing program and creates the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program with a $200,000 appropriation going to food banks for the purchase of locally produced food. Democrats criticized the shift from the pilot program, that provided assistance to both food banks and Iowa schools, as the new food purchasing program did not provide funding for schools to be able to purchase locally grown foods.
The Resources Enhancement and Protection (REAP) program, funding local projects related to natural resources conservation and public spaces, received a $12 million appropriation from the Environment First Fund — a lower amount than the $20 million standing appropriation in Iowa Code given to REAP.
Other spending
Administration and regulation: House File 1044 provides funding for several of Iowa’s statewide elected offices as well as state agencies like the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing (DIAL) and Department of Management and Department of Revenue. It also gives money for state entities like the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS) and the state Utilities Board.
This year, the Legislature allocated $73.7 million from the general fund and $134.2 million from other funds through this budget. This year, lawmakers approved a $1.2 million increase for IPERS to hire new staff, and $600,000 for the state’s Insurance Division to increase oversight and regulation enforcement for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance providers and pharmacies.
Economic development: The budget for economic development initiatives, Senate File 645, includes $74.7 million in total spending from the general fund and other state resources. The money from this appropriations pool goes largely to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority and the Iowa Department of Workforce Development.
This year’s budget reduced funding for the World Food Prize and state tourism office, as well as money for several grant programs. But it also includes a $322,000 bump in funding for the Iowa Arts Council and $350,000 for the Council of Governments (COGS), money which can be leveraged with federal and local dollars to provide $3 million in funding for housing renewal projects across the state according to Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield. Latham said these projects can be taken on through the continuation of the Housing Renewal Pilot Program, which was extended for three years through the bill.
Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund (RIIF): House File 1039 appropriates $163.8 million from the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund and the Technology Infrastructure Fund. Though House GOP lawmakers said during debate they could not reach an agreement for several RIIF funding priorities in budget negotiations with the Senate this year, there were still several projects that received funding through the fund this year. The Iowa Law Enforcement Academy received $15 million for the creation of a new driver training facility, and the state historical building received $5 million to buy new storage units for preserving historical artifacts.
Transportation: The state’s transportation budget, $502.8 million for FY 2026, does not come from the general fund, but from the Road Use Tax Fund and Primary Road Fund. Senate File 628, providing funding for the Iowa Department of Transportation, included a $20 million increase in Road Use Tax Fund money to modernize the state’s drivers and vehicles record system, as well as $18.9 million to renovate the DOT’s Waterloo maintenance garage.

Like many first-time buyers with moderate incomes, they found they had to take on extra work, compromise on size and wait patiently for a house they could afford in today’s market (Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall).Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Judge Richard Mark Gergel, of the U.S. District Court of South Carolina, Charleston Division, handed down that order Tuesday in the ongoing federal court case The Sustainability Institute et al. v. Donald J. Trump.
Gergel’s order calls for the Trump administration to reinstate roughly three dozen grants that had been awarded to the City of New Haven, the City of Baltimore, and a handful of other municipalities and nonprofits through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
According to a press release sent out by Mayor Justin Elicker on Wednesday, this order applies to three federal grants the city has been awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): a $20 million Community Change grant, designed to promote energy-efficient homes and green transportation; a $9.5 million Climate Pollution Reduction grant to build out geothermal heat pumps for Union Station; and a $1 million Environmental Justice Government-to-Government grant, designed to help New Haveners transition their homes from oil to heat pumps.
[RELATED: New Haven takes big hit as CT climate grants remain in limbo]
New Haven had joined with fellow plaintiffs — like Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California — in suing the federal government in March, alleging that the Trump administration had illegally frozen or terminated the congressionally appropriated funds underlying these grants.
Federal lawyers did not contest the plaintiffs’ claims that the Trump administration had acted in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in regards to 32 of the 38 relevant grants. However, they sought to get the district court from holding off on issuing ​“injunctive relief” for the plaintiffs while the Trump administration appealed the court’s jurisdiction under the APA.
Ultimately, Gergel decided to grant ​“permanent injunctive relief” for these 32 grants — including the three awarded to New Haven.
“Plaintiffs have produced substantial, highly persuasive evidence to support their claims that their grant funds were frozen and/or terminated because Defendants disfavored previously authorized congressional appropriations and that such actions were outside of the legal authority of the agency Defendants and in violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers,” Gergel wrote.
In response to the Trump administration’s request for the district court to hold off on granting injunctive relief, he wrote, ​“the public interest lies in upholding the rule of law and providing an effective remedy for those injured by the unlawful actions of government officials. For these reasons, Defendants motion to stay is denied.”
Click here to read Gergel’s order in full.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
“Contrary to President Trump’s executive orders and actions, the way we ​‘Unleash American Energy’ is by leveraging our country’s own renewable resources, including solar, wind and geothermal,” Elicker is quoted as saying in Wednesday’s celebratory press release. ​“It’s better for our pocketbooks, our environment and our national security, and we are encouraged that this ruling will allow New Haven and other cities and nonprofits across the nation to do exactly that.”
City climate czar Steve Winter was also quoted in Wednesday’s press release, stating, ​“I’m thrilled that the court has blocked the Trump administration’s illegal and unjustified freeze of funding for important climate change and clean energy projects in New Haven. The work that our team does every day in partnership with City agencies and community partners helps improve air quality, lower energy bills, and address our climate crisis.”
This marks the second time in two months that a federal judge has sided with New Haven in one of a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration. In late April, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration can’t withhold funds from New Haven, San Francisco, and a dozen other cities just because they are​ “sanctuary jurisdictions” that limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
New Haven has been represented in both of these federal cases by Public Rights Project.

The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.  “We need to confer […]","Members of Kansas Interfaith action protested the reopening of the Leavenworth CoreCivic prison outside a Tuesday hearing at the U.S. District Court in Topeka. The case was dismissed on Thursday. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge cleared the way Thursday for CoreCivic to reopen its Leavenworth prison as an immigration detention center, saying he lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver. 
“We need to confer with our attorneys,” said Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager. “We will probably discuss it with the city commission sometime next week.”
Peterson said he didn’t know whether further court action could occur before June 1, when CoreCivic officials had indicated they may begin receiving detainees.
“We may have further negotiations with CoreCivic themselves about this,” Peterson said. 
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case, saying the city failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. During a Tuesday hearing, Crouse repeatedly questioned whether he had any basis to act, saying the city had not adequately outlined that issue.
Crouse, appointed to the bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump, highlighted two pending motions before him, including Leavenworth’s request for an injunction that would have stopped CoreCivic from reopening until it could be determined whether the company had to go through the city’s development process. CoreCivic had asked for a dismissal of the case.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said in court Tuesday that CoreCivic had agreed not to take detainees until June 1 while the case was decided.
After the hearing, Hatley said in an interview there were concerns that if detainees were housed in the prison before the legal disputes were resolved, the federal government could refuse to move the detainees regardless of the outcome of the case.
“The City asserts that Core Civic should be enjoined from operating its detention facility without the proper permit,” Crouse wrote in his ruling Thursday. “But it has not pled facts to establish that subject-matter jurisdiction exists in federal court to consider that claim. Accordingly, this action is dismissed, and the parties’ motions are denied as moot.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company was pleased with the decision. 
“We remain focused on ensuring the Midwest Regional Reception Center is prepared to meet the needs of our federal partner,” he said.
Gustin did not answer questions about whether CoreCivic intended to begin housing ICE detainees in June. 
 
Move forward
Activists who have spoken out against reopening the facility are hopeful the city will appeal. 
“We hope the city will explore all of its options as the concerns of the lawsuit since its filing in February — CoreCivic’s disregard for the city’s governance and its rush to fill the facility without accountability — have only grown more urgent,” Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said in an email.
Tseng also said the judge’s decision held hope with regard to whether CoreCivic would have to follow Leavenworth development codes requiring the company to apply for a special use permit. 
“It’s also worth noting that in the dismissal, the court agreed that when CoreCivic ceased operation for 12 months, it lost its non-conforming status and that its initial application for the special use permit appeared to be a recognition of this fact,” she said.  
CoreCivic was grandfathered into the city’s development codes when it was open and operating as the Leavenworth Detention Facility from 1992 to 2021. The codes were passed in 2012. 
City officials, as laid out in the lawsuit, have told CoreCivic it must apply for a special use permit.
 
‘Great start’
CoreCivic’s reopening of the Leavenworth facility, which closed in 2021 at the end of its federal contract and under numerous accusations of inhuman treatment at the facility, is part of the company’s plan to reopen nine idle facilities.
In its May earnings report, CoreCivic announced total revenue of $488.6 million, with net income of $25.1 million.
“2025 is off to a strong start for CoreCivic. First quarter occupancy in CoreCivic facilities reached 77% of available capacity, an increase from 75.2% in the first quarter of last year,” said CEO Damon T. Hininger in a press release. “Based on cost management and increased bed utilization, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), we exceeded our internal expectations for the first quarter. Additionally, we have begun to re-activate three previously idle facilities under multiple agreements with ICE.”
In Security and Exchange Commission filings, CoreCivic said it had nine idle facilities, including the Leavenworth facility, renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“CoreCivic anticipates additional contracting activity as 2025 progresses,” Hininger said. “In addition to the facilities we are currently activating, we are making preparatory investments in many of our other idle facilities so that they will be available quickly, as our partners’ needs require and as their budgets allow.”
 
Leavenworth contract
CoreCivic SEC filings and a press release said they signed a letter of agreement with ICE at the beginning of March to reopen the Leavenworth facility, which would house 1,033 detainees. As a result, ICE paid CoreCivic $5 million with a maximum of $22.6 million set over a six-month period to cover start-up expenses while the two hash out a long-term contract. 
In its quarterly report, filed May 8 with the SEC, CoreCivic noted that Leavenworth filed a lawsuit.
“CoreCivic plans to vigorously defend this matter on the basis that the (special use permit) is not applicable under existing statute,” the filing said. “CoreCivic has agreed with the City of Leavenworth to not accept detainees prior to June 1, 2025 while this matter is deliberated. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain a favorable ruling in this matter or that ICE and the Company will ultimately enter into a long-term contract for the utilization of the Company’s Midwest Regional Reception Center.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200641-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A late spring nor’easter dumped 2 inches of rain on Newport Thursday. Not exactly the best weather for an outdoor display of over 7,000 combat boots.
“They’ve been out there for nine years, and they’re beginning to show their wear and tear and weather like this does not help,” Erik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon as rain and heavy winds swept through the state.
But then combat boots are designed for rough terrain, extreme weather, and heavy-duty use. And the boots on display in the Boots on the Ground for Heroes Memorial are holding up thanks to the TLC from Operation Stand Down staff and hundreds of volunteers. The memorial opened Friday morning under cloudy skies at Fort Adams State Park in Newport. 
Each boot in the memorial organized by Operation Stand Down has a U.S. flag and a tag with the name and photo of a fallen service member killed in action since 9/11 in the Global War on Terror.
The memorial remains open to the public for viewing 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. through Sunday and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday. Admission is free.


The boots are organized alphabetically and by state and U.S. territories. Visitors often leave coins on the boots, some are symbolic of a personal connection to the soldier, sailor, Marine or Coast Guard personnel who died. A quarter could mean you were with the service member when they died; a dime that you served with the deceased; a nickel that you were at basic training together; and a penny that you visited and paid your respects and thanked the veteran for their service.
With the exception of the possibility of a passing late afternoon shower Friday and a lesser chance on Saturday, Wallin is thankful the National Weather Service forecasts calls for a dry Sunday and Memorial Day.
The memorial has been installed each year at Fort Adams since 2019. One year, it rained throughout the holiday weekend and into the following days so the boots could not dry out. Wallin said the boots had to be hauled to the Rhode Island Army National Guard Armory in Warwick to dry out.
The boots spend most of the year stored in a trailer. But this past Monday, Operation Stand Down staff drew the grid on the field inside Fort Adams. Over 200 volunteers helped place the boots and flags over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday. 
“There was a little bit of mold on them,” Wallin said.
Not anymore though. Among the volunteers who came to help set up the memorial this week, the East Providence High School football team helped clean boots.
“We’re tremendously blessed, all of us at Operation Stand Down,” Wallin said. “It’s very moving to see a hundred volunteers show up on any one day, both as a tribute to those who have fallen and it’s a tremendous recognition of people appreciating the sacrifice and service of our U.S. military.
This year there are exactly 7,326 boots, the same number on display last year, Wallin said. More boots are added each year if additional U.S. service members are killed in action in war operations under the specific criteria of the Department of Defense.
Each fallen hero is represented by a single boot except for the 29 Rhode Island service members killed who are each honored with a pair of boots. A separate circle with pairs of desert tan boots pays tribute to the fallen veterans from Rhode Island.
The rest of the boots are black, acquired through military surplus a decade ago. Since then, the Defense Department has switched over to desert tan boots.
“Unfortunately these have been part of the memorial now for over nine years, and they do begin to show their age,” Wallin said. “We’re kind of at that vector point of having to make a decision about going out and investing in an entirely new set.”

While speaking to SCSU graduates at Total Morgage Arena in Bridgeport on Thursday night, Cardona also made a handful of references to the hit Broadway show Hamilton (Governor Ned Lamont (D) was also once fond of referencing the play).
Cardona reflected on his job interview to join the Lamont administration — where the two found common ground as Hamilton fans.
“After we got all the serious stuff out of the way, I got up to leave, and I remembered what he said about Hamilton, so I got up all serious. I looked him in the eyes, and I said, ‘Governor, just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry, and I’m not throwing away my shot.’”
“I’m not saying that’s why I got the job, but it didn’t hurt,” Cardona said. “It did not hurt.”
Cardona has been floated as a possible replacement for Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng. When recently asked about that possibility, Lamont said he wasn’t ready to comment.
During Thursday’s ceremony, multiple speakers referenced the value of Southern’s diverse class. The name Donald Trump was not mentioned — but the messages were clear: diversity was and is a vital part of education.
“Our nation is constantly made better by our beautifully diverse people, no matter what people are saying these days,” Cardona said.
Diversity, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies Dr. Rabia Hos said, was also a cornerstone of academic research at the university.
Hos rattled off a few of the projects students participated in while obtaining their degrees: the effects of systemic racism affect mental health care in African Ameican commnuities, how to break down language barriers for immigrant families, and the development of role playing therapy models for neurodiverse kids.
“I have spent my career researching and writing about multilingual learners and immigrant students, those whose identities and experiences are often pushed to the margins in classroom and policies,” Hos said. “I continue to write, publish and speak because I believe scholarship should live beyond the page. It must challenge inequity, elevate silent voices and create space for all students to thrive.”

States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
Why teachers leave: 2 educators share their experiences

“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”
Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
North Dakota teachers leaving profession earlier

States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Task force seeks to get new teachers past the 5-year mark

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Connecticut has the second-highest rate of active registrations in the National Do Not Call Registry and has filed the second-most complaints, per capita, to the Federal Communications Commission about unwanted calls. 
In 2024, there were 2,253 complaints about unwanted calls to the Consumer Help Center in Connecticut. The topics of the calls include solar panel services, IRS services, mortgage services and political campaigns, among others. 
That’s about 61.3 unwanted calls per 100,000 residents, a rate that trails only Washington.
So far in 2025, there have been 648 complaints, according to data from the Federal Communications Commission’s Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division. 
Consumers can also file complaints about spam calls to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission. In the 2024 fiscal year, there were more than 2 million complaints about unwanted spam calls. In Connecticut, there were 23,048 complaints, which is about 639 per 100,000 residents.
Consumers can tell companies that they do not want telemarketing sales calls through the Federal Trade Commission’s Do Not Call registry, According to its website, “companies that make unwanted calls to consumers may be violating the Do Not Call rules.”
Connecticut ranks second in most the active registrations per population, behind only New Hampshire.
Even if a number is not in the registry, robocall sales are illegal, unless the caller has written permission from a consumer.

Lawmakers agree to double unemployment for miners
Some 630 idled workers at two northern Minnesota mines will be eligible for a full year of unemployment benefits under a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate announced on Thursday.
Workers are typically only eligible for 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, which cover about half their earnings while they look for new jobs. But six-figure mining jobs won’t be easy to find in the area until Cleveland Cliffs restarts operations at Minorca Mine in Virginia and Hibbing Taconite, raising the prospect that workers would have to move out-of-state.
“We have to make sure that the steelworkers that are laid off at our mines stay in our communities on the Iron Range … for when our mines are ready to get back up and operational,” bill author Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said on the Senate floor last month.
Doubling unemployment benefits for miners was never in doubt even as Republicans looked to repeal all unemployment benefits for bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other hourly school workers. Republicans championed their own bill extending benefits to laid off miners, and the Democratic version passed off the House floor on Monday 132-0.
That underscores the importance of miners as much to the local Iron Range economy as the state’s identity as the country’s largest producer of iron ore and taconite. It also reflects the rightward shift of the Iron Range, which now sends mostly Republicans to St. Paul to represent its interests.
The number of mining jobs have been steadily eroded by automation, but those that remain are some of the highest paid in the region and support numerous adjacent industries.
Mining giant Cleveland Cliffs announced in March that it would temporarily layoff about 630 workers, who are unionized with the United Steelworkers, as demand for steel in the auto industry cratered under worsening consumer sentiment, high interest rates and tariffs from the Trump administration.
Trump’s trade war has not seemed to dent enthusiasm for tariffs among the laid off steelworkers or Cleveland Cliffs CEO Lourenco Gonclaves.
The Department of Employment and Economic Development estimates the additional benefits will cost the state about $15 million, assuming 630 workers receive $914 a week on average.
Unemployment benefits for hourly school workers cost around $57 million in 2024, helping workers who earn around $17 an hour on average make ends meet through the summer. The state Legislature passed a bill this year that would give school districts an additional $100 million to pay for the benefits, while a Republican effort to repeal the benefits in 2029 failed.
Democrats also hope to extend unemployment benefits to federal employees who are laid off as part of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal workforce. There were only about 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month — many of Trump’s layoffs have been reversed or paused — but state officials said they expect to see a large drop at some point.
Legislators reach impasse over noncompetes 
Lawmakers deadlocked, again, on Thursday over a Republican push to roll back the state’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements.
Repealing the ban for white collar workers is a top priority for the Minnesota Business Partnership, which includes more than 100 executives of the state’s largest companies. They argue the ban undermines companies’ right to protect valuable trade secrets, even though proprietary information is already protected under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.
The ban’s author Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said large companies are pushing to restore noncompetes to stifle competition and push down wages.
“It gives them power to restrict their employees from leaving, from going to a competitor, from starting a small business … Trade secrets are actually very well protected,” Greenman said during a meeting between House and Senate members of the jobs “working group” on Thursday.
About one in five American workers — in jobs ranging from medicine to child care — are bound by a noncompete agreement, which costs workers more than $250 billion per year by decreasing competition, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC proposed a national ban on noncompetes under the Biden administration.
Workers in California have famously been able to hop from employer to employer because the state doesn’t enforce noncompete agreements, which Berkeley political scientist AnnaLee Saxenian and other experts have cited as a key factor that fueled the immense, wealth-creating innovation of Silicon Valley.
Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, proposed the working group insert a provision in their larger jobs and labor agreement that would allow companies to enforce noncompete agreements for employees making more than $120,000 and whose primary duties include “research and development or the creation, analysis, or modification of confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.”
Greenman said the proposal’s vague language was “trojan horse” that would effectively allow companies to require any worker earning more than $120,000 a year to sign a non-compete agreement.
She asked Baker if he could define “confidential” and “proprietary.” Baker said it was “extremely technical,” and then called for a recess, during which he conferred with a lobbyist from the Minnesota Business Partnership in the hallway.
The proposal failed to get enough support to be adopted, as did a Democratic proposal that would have raised the income threshold for the noncompete ban and required companies to pay the full salary of employees during the enforcement period of the noncompete.
Without a deal, the issue will likely be sent to legislative leaders and the governor to find a compromise; lawmakers are already working past Monday’s adjournment to pass a two-year budget. Without a budget by July 1, swathes of the government shutter.
Nurses union accuses hospitals of skimping on charity care

The largest hospital systems in the Twin Cities and Duluth areas receive tens of millions more in tax exemptions than they give back through charity care, according to a report released this week by the Minnesota Nurses Association.
The union estimates seven hospital systems — Allina, Children’s, Essentia, Fairview, HealthPartners, North Memorial and St. Luke’s — received $3.9 billion in federal, state and local tax exemptions between 2018 and 2022 but only spent $607 million in free or reduced cost care for poor patients. The union also estimates hospitals’ spending on charity care relative to their overall budgets has fallen by nearly half on average over the past decade, from .78% in 2013 to .41% in 2022.
“The nation’s earliest hospitals were founded principally by religious and charitable organizations to tend to the sick and poor. Today’s not-for-profit hospitals and systems, often monumentally wealthy and glittering institutions, are their distant cousins,” the report says.
The union is currently negotiating new labor contracts on behalf of some 15,000 nurses with the seven large hospital systems scrutinized in the report. The nurses are seeking higher pay and staffing levels ,and the report serves as a response to health leader’s assertions that their demands are unaffordable. As during the last round of negotiations, the union also takes aim at sky-high hospital executive compensation.
Hospitals will point out that charity care represents just a small fraction of the community benefits they provide, including research, education, contributions to community groups, and losing money on Medicaid patients.
Earlier this year, the state Office of the Legislative Auditor released a report finding that Minnesota’s 104 nonprofit general hospitals appear to give back more to their communities than they receive in tax breaks, although it depends on what is counted as a community benefit, and with the caveat that tax benefits are difficult to estimate.
The OLA report looked at individual hospitals’ finances, whereas MNA analyzed health systems as a whole, which include many hospitals in addition to clinics, pharmacies, assisted living facilities and more. Unlike the MNA report, the OLA report does not account for indirect benefits of hospitals’ tax exempt statuses like being able to issue bonds and receive charitable gifts.
The health care reform think tank Lown Institute used a more limited definition of community benefit when it estimated that 90% of Minnesota’s hospitals receive more in tax breaks than they give back to the community, adding up to a $1.1 billion loss for the state.
Nonprofit hospitals are exempt from taxes on income, property and sales with the expectation that they reinvest those savings back into the community. Minnesota and the federal government require hospitals to report this spending, at least in vague terms, but don’t require a minimum amount of spending in exchange for their tax-exempt status.
The nurses union has sought legislation requiring greater disclosure and more restrictions on community benefits from hospitals.
Colorado governor vetoes pro-union bill
Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill this month that would have repealed the state’s unique anti-union law that effectively makes it a right-to-work state.
Under Colorado’s 80-year-old Labor Peace Act, unions must win a second election with 75% support in order to collect dues from all represented workers. The law was passed before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which enabled states to pass right-to-work laws banning unions from collecting mandatory dues from all workers represented by their collective bargaining agreements.
Repealing the requirement was a key priority for unions in Colorado, and it passed with wide margins along party lines in the state Legislature. Polis said he wanted unions and businesses to find common ground, and that there should be a “high threshold of worker participation” for mandatory dues.
The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute noted that Colorado’s union density of 7.7% is closer to the 6.2% average for right-to-work states than the 15.8% in non-right-to-work states. In Minnesota, which does not have a right-to-work law, 14.2% of workers are union members.
Minnesota state lawmakers have made it easier in recent years for public sector workers to join a union. Under a 2023 law, a public union may be certified once a majority of workers sign cards in support of unionizing without the need for an election as required in the private sector.
Resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota were able to quickly unionize using this “card check” process. Those workers may not be required to pay union dues, however, because of a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that bars public-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers they represent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HibTac-Mine-view.webp,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

David Beasley asked her to join South Carolina’s Juvenile Parole Board some three decades ago, Terrye Seckinger was unaware there was a group of citizens deciding which incarcerated youth should be allowed to rejoin the community and which should remain in state custody for crimes they committed as children.
Since then, she has served on a total of five citizen governing boards covering criminal justice and education in the state. Once her tenure was over on one board, it wasn’t long before a Republican governor called her about another.
“It’s not like people are knocking down the doors,” Seckinger said. “In fact, most don’t even know there are these boards where citizens can come and make a difference and have a say in our state government.”
Keeping seats full on South Carolina’s vast and vague committees is a challenge for the state’s political leaders, especially the governor, who’s tasked with making most of the appointments, with the Senate’s approval.

High-profile boards, such as those overseeing the port or state-owned utility company, have a long line of hopefuls seeking a position.
But vacancies can linger for lesser-known but not necessarily less important groups.
The Palmetto State has just shy of 300 such boards and advisory groups with about 5,000 politically appointed positions, equivalent to the population of a small South Carolina town, said Brandon Charochak, spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster.
They make decisions for South Carolinians on a host of issues, including public colleges, historic districts, disease prevention and professional licensing.
There are boards dedicated to the management of aquatic plants and waterfowl habitats, those that oversee operations at specialized K-12 boarding schools, and a group that makes maintenance decisions at the Governor’s Mansion.
Some have less responsibility, rarely meet or simply remain on the books despite being unfunded or out of existence for years.
A long list of vacancies
A list published by the Secretary of State’s office advertises some 425 vacancies, though how many seats are truly open is unclear. The office depends on the boards to keep the list current. Many don’t. At least a third of them don’t actually exist anymore.


How to apply
To be considered for appointment to one of South Carolina’s hundreds of citizen boards and commissions, you can fill out an online interest form to the Governor’s Office here.
A list of vacancies is maintained by the Secretary of State’s Office, though don’t rely on it to be accurate.
Qualifications for each board are listed in the Legislative Manual.
Most appointment decisions are left up to the governor and require confirmation by the Senate.


But for others, lingering openings on boards can have an oversized impact on the lives of South Carolinians.
A seat held for someone with a disabled family member living in a state institution remains unfilled on the Adult Protection Coordinating Council, which is tasked with improving the system of care for people with disabilities.
A doctor and a pathologist are needed for a panel that reviews death investigations for the elderly and disabled living in state-contracted facilities. The Vulnerable Adults Fatalities Review Committee aims to identify trends and prevent future deaths.
Spots for four business people remain unfilled on the Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, a board that comes up with the strategies for training workers needed to fill the many job openings in the state.
A prosecutor, a youth recreation organization, and a special education expert are missing from the Governor’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Council, which is tasked with plans for keeping children out of the juvenile justice system.
The board governing the Conservation Bank, which doles out grants to preserve land from development, has several openings. So does the board that oversees billions in bond financing for hospitals, schools and colleges.
There are also openings on the commission that reviews foster care placements to ensure children have a safe and stable home.
The list goes on.
SC woman sues over ‘racial quota’ for minority affairs board

A call for change
How active a board is depends greatly on how much its members are willing to work, said Seckinger.
Like many who sit on boards, she’s politically connected. Beasley was a family friend even before she and her sister worked on his 1994 campaign for governor. Her brother is state Sen. Chip Campsen, who was first elected to the state House in 1996.
Being known in political circles, combined with a willingness to devote her time, explains why she keeps getting those calls.
“I tend to find myself in the fox hole,” she said.
It’s up to the agency heads to keep things running day to day. A good board, according to Seckinger, does not micromanage but rather comes up with new ideas and thinks about government in terms of what could be.
“Members of the public bring a different perspective to agencies,” she said. “I think there’s wisdom in that different set of eyes.”
For Seckinger, that led to a successful push for public charter schools in the state after she spent time serving on the State Board of Education. And during her time on the Commission for Higher Education, she argued unsuccessfully for changing to a centralized Board of Regents rather than individual college boards, saying it would lead to better scrutiny of college tuition costs and spending.
“Looking with a business mindset, you see things in agencies that don’t make sense or ways to spend less,” Seckinger said. “Because it’s our tax dollars.”
Eliminate them?

The issue of board vacancies even led Gov. Henry McMaster to use his State of the State address this year to call for the review and potential elimination of the state’s more than 40 professional licensing boards. They regulate cosmetologists, construction contractors, chiropractors, real estate agents, nurses, doctors, dentists and more.
If the boards were eliminated, oversight would instead be handled directly by the state’s licensing agency, rather than board appointees.
But the General Assembly ultimately did not oblige that request.
Legislators did, however, combine a trio of health-related state agencies into a single, Cabinet-level agency, eliminating their separate governing and advisory boards.
“We have way too many boards and commissions,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey previously told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s difficult for the governor to find qualified, interested people to serve. Not because we haven’t tried or think it’s not important.”
The Edgefield Republican was among supporters of consolidating the health agencies to one department overseen by a single director who answers to the governor.
“My position for years has been if you’re going to have a governor, let him be governor,” Massey said.
Beyond that, Massey said, those people who would best serve in these positions are often already too busy.
He recalls long-standing vacancies on the committee that oversees the state’s clay, gold, stone and sand mines. Vacancies have also resulted in boards lacking a quorum, meaning they can’t meet.
‘Not a simple process’
Some lawmakers call SC Arts Commission funding a ‘waste.’ Supporters say it’s essential.

Even boards without vacancies are stacked with people serving well beyond their prescribed term. They’re left in what’s known as holdover status, often for years — some for more than a decade.
Henry Horowitz of Greenville served on the South Carolina Arts Commission for 20 years, six of those as chairman, since being appointed by former Gov. Mark Sanford. While not an artist himself, Horowitz has been heavily involved in the arts, serving on half a dozen boards and founding the Artisphere festival in Greenville.
This year, he said, he told McMaster it was time to find someone new for the small but influential state board that last year distributed $18.4 million to support the arts, from emerging artists to Charleston’s long-running Spoleto festival.
His replacement is among five new members of the nine-member arts commission confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. All five are replacing people who had been serving six years or more past the expiration of their terms.
In all, the Senate made about 75 confirmations and reconfirmations to boards and commissions this year. More than a dozen other nominees went unconfirmed before the 2025 legislative session officially ended May 8.
Horowitz, like Seckinger, only knew of the opening in 2005 because the governor called him.
People can apply online, but those without political connections may not know the vacancies — or the boards themselves — exist.
“It’s hard to get on a board when you’re not aware of them,” he said. “Therefore, people don’t get invited.”
Many of these board members are not paid for their time beyond covering travel expenses. The screening involves a financial and criminal history check and hearings before Senate committees. Horowitz also recalls having to submit five letters of recommendation when he applied.
“It’s not a simple process,” he said.
Charochak, the governor’s spokesman, said it’s common for applicants to drop out once they find out about the six-month to year-long procedure.
“That’s truly the main issue we have,” he said.
The impact of vacancies
SC woman who killed her abuser again denied parole after nearly 5 years in prison

A state parole board decision last fall — when those supporting a woman’s release included her local legislator, police chief and solicitor — serves as an example of how vacancies and absences on a board can make a real difference in people’s lives.
If one more board member had been present, the Greenwood mother of five imprisoned for killing her abuser may have been released after nearly five years behind bars.
One parole board seat remains unfilled some eight months later.
McMaster pointed to another case in making his argument for doing away with independent governing boards at the state’s mental health and disabilities agencies. A lawsuit filed in December by the U.S. Department of Justice accuses the state of keeping adults with serious mental illnesses in institutions longer than necessary. It was filed 17 months after federal authorities warned a lawsuit was imminent if nothing changed.
McMaster said putting the governor’s office in charge would allow whoever’s governor to respond and hold people more accountable when things go wrong.
But advocates for these populations are less certain.
Bill Lindsey, who heads South Carolina’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said having mental health commissioners from each congressional district gave families direct access to decision makers when issues arose. While agency employees set policy, commissioners can serve as advocates.
Margie Williamson agreed. She’s spent the last 15 years leading a nonprofit advocacy group in Columbia for people with developmental disabilities, called The Arc of South Carolina.
“Speaking as a parent, I had somebody who represented my child,” she said. “Otherwise, in the agency, (those with disabilities) can get lost, being seen as just a number and not a person.”
DOJ sues SC over claims of warehousing people with mental illness

With more than 20,000 people with disabilities on a waiting list for state services, Williamson is worried more people will slip through the cracks. Coupled with a multitude of proposed cuts to federal aid programs and possibly Medicaid, she said the lack of certainty has become overwhelming.
Lindsey said he’s hopeful, even as the Department of Mental Health is folded into a larger Cabinet agency, that the commission will remain intact in an advisory capacity, keeping family members informed of what’s going on as the agency restructures.
Lindsey also said he was surprised by the legal action taken by the U.S. Department of Justice. While there was still more work to be done to improve the quality of housing for those transitioning out of mental health hospitals, he had felt the state had made great strides.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2074-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-23 14:23:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,78-year-old death row inmate pins hope of reprieve on timing and PTSD,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/23/78-year-old-death-row-inmate-pins-hope-of-reprieve-on-timing-and-ptsd/,Vietnam War vet Richard Jordan's crime and sentence came after the U.S. Supreme Court said capital punishment was unconstitutional.,"In the remaining weeks before his scheduled execution, Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, is looking for ways to fight his death sentence. 
Jordan was sentenced to death for the kidnap and murder of Gulfport resident Edwina Marter in January 1976. Marter’s sons, who were 3 and 9 at the time of her death, and her husband are still alive, according to public records. About a decade ago, her family told The Advocate they were hoping to receive closure from the execution after years of its delay. 
The decision to let the execution proceed rests in the hands of the Mississippi Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal district court judge – two courts that have rejected his previous requests and a judge who has allowed another execution to be carried out while a challenge to the state’s execution protocol continues. 
Attorneys filed two motions asking the Mississippi Supreme Court to rehear its denial of the 78-year-old’s petition for post conviction relief and to rehear its order setting his execution. 
They wrote that when the court denied his post-conviction relief petition, it “misapprehended the facts and the law.” To fix it, Jordan asked the court to vacate his death sentence or at a minimum return it to the trial court for another look. 
His attorneys argue Jordan’s death sentence is not valid because in 1976, when the murder was committed and Jordan was sentenced, Mississippi and all other states had ceased executions based on a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment was unconstitutional. 
On July 2, 1976, four months after Jordan was sentenced, the Supreme Court overturned this ruling in Gregg v. Georgia. Mississippi passed a statute allowing discretionary death penalty sentences in 1977.
“Here, because there was no constitutional provision for the death penalty at the time of Jordan’s offense, his death sentence is unconstitutional,” the May 15 filing states. 
Jordan went to trial multiple times and his sentences were overturned. His death sentence did not stick until decades later in 1998. Since his first trial, Jordan has been incarcerated for nearly 50 years. 
In another recent court filing, Jordan’s attorneys argue the state’s motion to set Jordan’s execution didn’t follow state law because he has not exhausted all state and federal remedies. 
Jordan asked the U.S. Supreme Court in March to hear his case. As of May, that petition for writ of certiorari is awaiting a decision. The state opposes and has asked the high court not to take up Jordan’s petition, saying the Mississippi Supreme Court was correct in its ruling. 
That petition centers around his access to a mental health expert separate from the prosecution to develop and present sentencing mitigation as an indigent defendant, which was established as a constitutional right through the U.S. Supreme Court’s Ake v. Oklahoma decision. The other issue is how the Mississippi Supreme Court handled Jordan’s Ake claims in his appeal and post-conviction. 
At trial, Jordan was evaluated by a state psychiatrist whose report was also given to the prosecution, which his attorneys argue undermined his mitigation case since the Ake decision specified the evaluation was to be used on the indigent defendant’s behalf.
The petition states he was not diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his combat service in Vietnam, but instead incorrectly as having antisocial personality disorder. 
“Review of that decision is manifestly warranted to ensure appropriate respect for this Court’s decisions, vindicate the supremacy of federal law, and ensure that those defendants in Mississippi whose mental health will be an issue at trial receive the right to the expert assistance to which the Due Process Clause entitles them,” the March court filing states. 
Additionally, Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the drugs used for lethal injection. 
Since 2022, the state has since added alternative execution methods if lethal injection drugs aren’t available: execution by gas chamber, electrocution or firing squad. To date, a handful of states have used these other methods, including the use of nitrogen gas in Alabama and firing squad in South Carolina. 
The Mississippi lawsuit did not stop the December 2022 execution of Thomas Loden, another inmate who was part of the legal challenge. 
The same day Jordan’s attorneys filed motions with the Mississippi Supreme Court, Jordan and Chase filed a motion with U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, asking for him to order the state to provide essential documents to the plaintiffs about the state’s possession and planned use of execution drugs as well as documents related to the most recent executions of David Cox in 2021 and Loden. 
Plaintiffs wrote that access to this information would help them seek an injunction to stay Jordan’s execution and help with discovery, which is the process of obtaining evidence from other parties before trial. Trial for the lawsuit has been scheduled for Dec. 1, 2025. 
“It is unconscionable for Defendants to seek the execution of Richard Jordan while continuing to stonewall Plaintiffs’ repeated demands for supplementation of discovery in this case,” a May 14 court filing states.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/22091856/Mina-RichardJordan-FeatImage-04.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)Amid ongoing raids in Florida immigrant communities, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signed a bill Thursday creating an avenue for relief against people unlawfully providing immigration legal services.
HB 915, one of 17 bills DeSantis signed Thursday, prohibits notaries public from advertising their services using language that implies they possess professional legal skills in immigration law. Notaries public are authorized to serve as witnesses and verify signatures on documents such as powers of attorney, deeds, and estates.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst with Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a phone interview that the group sought help from lawmakers in addressing the problem of notaries public providing immigration legal services, which he described as an epidemic in Central and South Florida. He called the signing of the new law good news.
“This is happening all over the place. People are very, very desperate for some sort of solution or adjustment of status that leaves them vulnerable for people that are preying on them,” Kennedy said, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in Florida at risk of deportation after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this week allowing the Trump administration to strip the immigrants of temporary protections and work permits.
A series of special sessions at the beginning of the year yielded hundreds of millions for local law enforcement to engage in immigration enforcement, plus new laws heightening penalties for immigrants living in the country without authorization. However, during the regular legislative session, lawmakers didn’t pass other proposals cracking down on legal aid for immigrant children and companies hiring people unauthorized to work in the country.
But nearly all lawmakers agreed to pass the bill from Orlando Democratic Rep. Johanna López, allowing people to recover damages in civil lawsuits from notaries public providing representation in immigration law matters.
Further, notaries public won’t be able to refer to themselves as “notario público,” the term in Spanish, because in some Latin American countries “notarios” can file legal documents, give legal advice, and represent people in court, according to the final legislative analysis of the bill.
Still, Kennedy said passing a pro-immigrant law in this climate was no easy feat.
“I guess common sense prevailed in this matter,” he said.
