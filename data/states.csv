(Photo by Amanda Frank)At a book launch in May, Paul Herbert shared to a full theater at the Morris Thompson Cultural Visitors Center in Fairbanks how he met Chris Cannon, the author of the newly published book “In the Footsteps of the Traveller: The Astronomy of Northern Dene.”
One evening after he had been out on a trail all day, Herbert visited with a friend when they heard a faint knock on his door in Fort Yukon. 
“We looked at each other and I yelled, ‘Come in,’” Herbert said, “loud enough for someone to hear it next door.”
Nothing happened and he heard another quiet knock.
“So me and my friend looked at each other and I jumped up and went and yanked the door open and there’s this red-headed guy standing by the door. He stuck his hand out and he tried to talk to me in Gwich’in.”
The person knocking on Herbert’s door was Cannon.
“I gave him a hard time, I tried to drive him away, but he kept coming back. Then he said, ‘I’m here to talk to you about the stars.’”
Before Cannon met Herbert, and before he studied astronomy, Cannon’s life was more grounded. He grew up in Helena, Montana, and moved to Alaska in 2001 to study aviation in Anchorage before switching majors and earning a bachelor of science in wildlife biology. Working with the University of Alaska Museum of the North, Cannon traveled across Alaska with a portable planetarium used to teach about the northern lights, presenting to students. Through these presentations, Cannon noticed many of the student’s cultural responses, such as whistling at the northern lights. This sparked an interest in Indigenous knowledge of the sky.
“It became more of a personal interest to look for things, to look for books or something that I could read about, just to educate myself more about cultural knowledge of the sky. There was some good information out there for Inuit or Yupik. The more I dug into Northern Dene, the less I found. So that increased my curiosity to find something,” Cannon shared in an interview.
This book details a 15-year journey across Northern Dene communities, sometimes known as Athabascan in Alaska, meeting with elders and experts to learn more about the cultural stories and significance of Dene astronomical knowledge. Cannon received a master of arts in Northern studies at UAF and continued his work towards a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology at the university. He’s now an assistant professor at UAF’s College of Indigenous Studies.
Starting in 2009, Cannon worked with more than 65 elders in 34 communities across Alaska and Canada. That work became the basis for the new book, which features 60 illustrations and shares his research into the significance of the stars to Northern Dene life, language and culture.
A leading theme in the book is the story of the Traveller: a teacher, gamekeeper, guardian and practical guide for wayfinding. Cannon spent many years working in communities to identify the stories, combining interviews, photography and detailed illustrations. 
“The Traveller is this figure who went around the world in ancient times who shaped the world into the way it is today. To make the world more safer and more useful for humans or especially Dene peoples. It’s a world transformation story; it has lots of variation but it’s pretty widespread throughout the Americas,” Cannon shared.
The book guides readers through a deep dive of multiple Dene languages, explaining star formations. And it provides an exclusive depiction of Indigenous understandings of the sky and other celestial and atmospheric phenomena, from thunder to the northern lights, and how it relates to the human experience.
“When you discover this Traveller in the stars, you’re also discovering a lot about yourself and where you come from and that your spirit is also ancient and continuous through time,” he said. “And you understand how all things are related, which also informs how you are in the world and how you relate to it and treat things.”
Cannon hopes that his work brings about a new awareness and a deeper cultural context about the stars, stating that the teachings from the elders shared throughout the book have deep antiquity and still have uses in a modern and contemporary world.
“Like when you read about cultural astronomy, it’s always about this huge focus on the story but this is trying to push that beyond a story. Certainly there’s stories about the Traveller, but what’s more, is that there’s this model for how to live, be and relate to this world and everything in it. It’s a very huge concept, huge model, huge being up there that’s not treated as stars but treated as a living, animate thing that’s always there.”
Cannon’s research has been featured in shows such as Molly of Denali on PBS Kids, capturing audiences of all ages.
“Please know, Chris, that this is generational work for all of us as Indigenous people, as we get to know ourselves again as we make a shift from generational trauma to healing. It’s going to be generational healing from here on out and this is part of it,” said Teisha Simmons, dean of the College of Indigenous Studies, who shared the importance of Cannon’s work in closing at the book launch.
The book is published by the University of Manitoba Press. Cannon has offered the proceeds from the book to the Doyon Foundation in support of Northern Dene language revitalization.
For those who missed the book launch, Cannon will give a talk about his work as part of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Summer Lecture Series, on July 30, at 7 p.m. at the BP Design Theater on campus and available through a livestream.

As a young physician, I’ve come to recognize the pattern: young adults, unstably housed, cycling through jails, shelters and emergency rooms while grappling with severe psychosis unresponsive to conventional approaches. Some I’ve seen before. Many I’ll see again.
One such patient arrived in my care this past spring agitated and paranoid. Over several weeks, we adjusted his drug regimen, consulted specialists, and navigated the ethics of compelled medications after he stopped eating, convinced fasting would bring spiritual clarity as directed by his hallucinations.
Clozapine, the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, wasn’t an option. Without stable housing or a reliable system for routine blood monitoring, it simply wasn’t safe; its use demands regularity to avoid life-threatening side effects. We had to settle for a less effective, but more practical, substitute.
By discharge, he was calmer, eating and talking more. He agreed to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, and we arranged for transportation to a shelter with appointments at a public clinic. It wasn’t ideal, but it was something. His story, like so many others, reflects a broader, broken system. And like I’ve done so many times before, I let him go into uncertainty, hoping it would be enough.
This is not a mental health system. It’s crisis management on repeat.

Stories like his are painfully familiar. As a psychiatry resident working in Louisiana’s only public safety-net hospital, I see versions of this every day. Many of our patients spend their 20s bouncing between detention centers, psychiatric wards, and the streets. They’re denied consistent connection to care in systems shaped more by surveillance than by support.
Legislation like Senate Bill 196, House Bill 619, and House Bill 262 advance policies that may further isolate and penalize unhoused citizens by imposing criminal penalties for “unauthorized public camping.” Though including language about supportive interventions and rehabilitation, in practice, strict enforcement of these bills means prison time and fines for unhoused individuals, many of whom live with untreated psychiatric illness.
For decades, Louisiana has chronically underfunded mental health care. Rather than investing in recovery, the state is now leaning into penalizing homelessness, a condition many of my psychiatric patients experience, through newly proposed legislation. Such disinvestment makes healing nearly impossible for those with severe mental illness. Even after surviving years of trauma and reaching brief stability in clinical settings, patients often return to the circumstances that contributed to their illness in the first place. This return, however, may soon come with the added risk of criminalization.
After Hurricane Katrina shuttered Charity Hospital, followed by the closure of several other public psychiatric facilities, Louisiana promised to shift to a modern, community-based mental health network. That vision never fully materialized. Instead, the state adopted a crisis-oriented model: short inpatient stays, fragmented outpatient services, and minimal housing support.
Community mental health clinics are overwhelmed. Few psychiatrists accept Medicaid, and statewide reimbursement rates remain among the lowest in the United States, making it hard for providers to serve those who need us most. As of 2023, Louisiana only had 689 state hospital psychiatric beds, well below national recommendations. Just a handful of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams operate across the state despite widespread demand for this kind of wraparound support.
Mental illness affects people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds too, yet its consequences reflect entrenched inequities. Black Louisianans disproportionately affected as many experience delayed diagnoses, higher hospitalization rates, and increased criminalization.
Meanwhile, Louisiana, already home to one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, routinely relies on jails and prisons as de facto psychiatric facilities, a ramification of closed state mental health institutions and underfunded alternatives.
Inside our hospitals, we do everything we can no matter the patient. We titrate medications, discuss with social work and chaplains, and coordinate outpatient plans. But far too often, we discharge patients with little more than prescriptions and a list of follow-up appointments, knowing that without stability, recovery may not hold. We need more bridges across housing, outpatient care, and long-term community support.
What troubles me most isn’t how sick some of my patients are when they arrive to my care. It’s where they have to go when they start getting better.
I earn their trust. I see glimpses of the person beneath the illness. Then they are discharged… back into the very conditions that perpetuated their suffering.
In these cases, they don’t fail treatment; the system fails them. And that failure is the result of policy decisions that we have the power to change.
While Louisiana faces real limitations in resources, we need solutions rooted in continuity, compassion, and care that work, not more laws like Senate Bill 196.
This means investing in strategies that treat housing as health care like expanding Housing First initiatives that embed behavioral health care into living environments; establishing ACT teams especially in rural parishes; equipping mobile crisis teams to intervene early; fully funding community clinics serving patients with complex needs; creating psychiatric step-down facilities to offer structure without the trauma of institutionalization; and raising Medicaid reimbursement rates so more providers can serve this vulnerable population.
Above all, we must reject policies that punish illness and deepen despair. Lack of mental health access is a public crisis, not a crime, and our response must reflect that.
We cannot treat a delusion with a shelter cot alone. But we also cannot medicate someone into recovery only to abandon them at discharge. Bills like SB 196 don’t offer real answers. They present care as a reward for pleading guilty, not a right. In doing so, they are punitive for unhoused people with psychiatric illness and force clinicians like me to watch as patients are pushed from hospitals into handcuffs.
The safety net shouldn’t just catch people when they fall. It should be a bridge, to healing, to housing, to hope. Until we build that bridge, we will keep watching people fall through.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Post-Roe2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The group behind the black mass in March at the Kansas Statehouse — which drew thousands of counter-protesters and ended in multiple arrests — was denied a permit to hold another protest this summer.
Michael Stewart, the Satanic Grotto leader, says the denial is religious discrimination. Adam Proffitt, the Kansas secretary of administration, says the permit was denied because of safety concerns and violence at the last protest.
Stewart was planning a “witching hour protest” from 9 p.m. to midnight on Aug. 2 with the same sentiment as the black mass: “to end Christian favoritism within our state government,” as the group’s Facebook post reads.
“This isn’t just a permit denial; it’s an outright cancellation of our right to protest, fueled by what appears to be a deeply biased agenda,” Stewart said in a news release. “The State of Kansas is actively working to silence voices that challenge the status quo, especially those from minority faiths and marginalized communities.”
Stewart told Kansas Reflector that his permit request was “flat out ignored” for a few weeks, and he only got a response after he showed up in person.
In response to a Kansas Reflector request for comment, Department of Administration spokesman Samir Arif pointed to a response Proffitt had given to Stewart.
“The State has increased safety concerns regarding any event occurring on the south steps after sundown, including whether adequate Kansas Highway Patrol resources are available to address these safety concerns after dark,” Proffitt wrote.
In the new release, Stewart said Capitol Police Chief Brandon Bichsel told him he had “no reservations” about the police’s ability to maintain security. Bichsel did not respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
“Additionally, I decline to grant a permission to you, on behalf of the organization, due to improper acts that occurred when a previous permit space on the Statehouse grounds was granted to you for an event that occurred in March 2025,” Proffitt wrote, referencing the black mass.
The permit Stewart obtained for the black mass allowed the Satanic Grotto to protest outside of the Statehouse — but not inside — after Gov. Laura Kelly banned any protests inside the building on the planned day. Before the black mass, Stewart told Kansas Reflector he planned to defy Kelly’s directive.

On the day of the black mass, Stewart entered the Statehouse and began a dedication to Satan. Counter-protesters physically intervened, including Marcus Schroeder — a 21-year-old from Wisconsin who had been charged with making a false bomb threat on a Pride parade. After Schroeder attempted to grab Stewart’s copy of “The Satanic Bible” two times, Stewart punched Schroeder in the face twice, which resulted in both of their arrests.
“Your conduct created a risk to public safety, violated the terms of your permit, and caused injury to another person,” Proffitt wrote.
Shawnee County prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Stewart.
Restrictions didn’t stop Stewart at the last protest. But after his arrest, Stewart said he is hesitant to go forward with his planned “witching hour” event.
“We are going to do everything in our power to ensure the event can take place,” Stewart told Kansas Reflector. “However, after consultation with my criminal lawyer, I’m concerned the state is setting the ground for heavy consequences if we proceed.”
Stewart said he could face 18 months of incarceration if the prosecutors decide to pursue the charges from his black mass arrest. He said that being incarcerated would prevent him from serving the community.
“We aren’t done fighting,” he said. “We stepped up to the plate last time when it came to making a point with our safety and freedom. This time we will find other routes that hopefully illustrate the same points.”
The Department of Administration on July 1 denied Stewart’s request to reconsider its decision.
“Should your organization wish to reserve a space for its event, the ending time cannot go past sundown, and someone other than you must take responsibility for the application and event,” said Pat Doran, chief counsel for the Department of Administration, in an email to Stewart.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-punch-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-07 13:29:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lawmakers passed bimonthly pay for Mississippi teachers in 2022. Just four districts use it.,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/07/few-mississippi-school-districts-adopt-bimonthly-pay/,"Few Mississippi school districts have adopted bimontly pay for teachers, which was seen as a recruitment and retention tool.","The last weeks of January are difficult for Mississippi teachers. Mention of the stretch will draw audible gasps. By then, paychecks last deposited in mid-December are stretched thin. 
For Jefferson County biology teacher Chiquitta Gaylor, that meant Christmas shopping in July. For others, it means pay day loans and a tighter winter budget.
“Even to this day, that’s horrible,” said veteran Amanda Elzy High School teacher Brandice Brown-Williams. “Every year, I try to write a Facebook status and tell as many young teachers as I can to start saving in October.”

It’s a unique problem for teachers in districts that don’t pay their teachers twice a month or bimonthly. Only 10% of US employers pay monthly, according to the Bureau of US Labor Statistics.
In Mississippi, school districts were granted the right three years ago to pay teachers bimonthly. But few have made the change.
Mississippi Today compiled data from every school district in Mississippi regarding bimonthly teacher pay, calling superintendents and clicking through school handbooks. We found four of Mississippi’s 138 school districts had adopted it.
Lowndes County School District, Greenwood-Leflore Consolidated School District, Holly Springs School District and Harrison County School District offer bimonthly pay. Harrison County is the largest district to offer it.
During the 2022 legislative session, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, R-Leakesville, authored the bill giving districts the choice whether to adopt the policy of bimonthly pay that later became law.

“We have all probably heard teachers ask for it,” he said on the Senate floor.
In a recent interview with Mississippi Today, Debar remarked that it was about “security.”
“We’re trying to help get more young people into the education field,” he added.
In districts with high turnover rates and multiple vacancies, bimonthly pay could be an enticing enough incentive to retain some of their talent.
Mary Johnson felt so during her recent tenure as superintendent of Greenwood-Leflore Consolidated School District. On July 1, the Delta district became the latest to offer the payroll option. One teacher that was expected to leave already signed a contract for next year. Summer hiring has been easier, she reports.
“A lot of what we notice in the Mississippi Delta is teachers are trying to make ends meet,” said Johnson. “I feel like it’s going to help with teacher retention. It will relieve the stress to aid them to get from one period to the next.”
Her announcement of the new board policy went viral on Facebook. The posted video garnered about 90,000 views and was shared nearly 300 times.
She shared that most of the early resistance to the new policy came from a misunderstanding regarding taxes. Some of her teachers were under the impression their paycheck would be taxed twice. She also had to convince a payroll staff that would now have to double their workload.
“I think it’s going to be a recruitment strategy in the long run,” she said.
Some districts even tried bimonthly payout but found it impractical. The district had to hire payroll staff full time during the summer months to process the twice-a-month payments. That was the case in Gulfport, said Superintendent Glen East.
“But teacher retention has been an issue beyond bimonthly pay,” he said. “In the past, if we could get teachers past the three- and eight-year mark, we could keep them. That isn’t happening anymore.”
For public school advocates and political candidates, bimonthly teacher pay, like other investments in teaching staff, have been important campaign issues. Among other challenges confronted by Delta educators, it inspires former Greenville teacher and principal Clayton Barksdale to run for state Senate.
Barksdale feels bi-monthly teacher pay would help districts hold on to talented teachers. He remembers early on in his teaching career when he would call in sick for work because he didn’t have enough gas money to get to school.
“Teachers are a loving bunch,” he said. “They don’t mind using their own money for their classroom. So it would make sense to pay those teachers back in a form of biweekly pay as quickly as possible.”
“With bimonthly pay, you just feel better about coming to work. You have less stress. You have more life in you,” he said.
As a young single mom, Jefferson County School District biology teacher Chiquita Gaylor found it hard to budget, especially during the winter stretch. She frequently bought science kits out of her own pocketbook. 
“I think it would be helpful,” she said. “You have to be very, very disciplined.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03100346/3X0A7098.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146

Phil Eng



AFTER YEARS OF underinvestment and disrepair, the MBTA is well-positioned to build on crucial recent improvements, according to the man tasked with turning the blighted system around. 
With the system moving more than 800,000 passengers around its service area every day, facing the ire of frustrated riders and public pressure from elected officials to get the system on track, General Manager Phil Eng said he entered the transit system’s top job when it was hard but essential to “think big, think bold” to shake loose from a “status quo” spiral of worsening service. 
“The future is bright,” Eng told reporter Gintautas Dumcius on The Codcast, about two and a half years into the MBTA job and just after lawmakers and the governor approved a sweeping supplemental budget sending $548 million to the MBTA. When he started, Eng said, the system was “slowing down. We were degrading service, and confidence had been lost.”  
The culture at the T at the time was reliant on “external experts” rather than internal institutional knowledge, Eng said. There were also issues with decision-making and “accountability” for those decisions, he said.  
A civil engineer, Eng came to the MBTA from his post as president of the New York commuter railroad, the Long Island Rail Road. From his vantage point as a newcomer, “we were basically going towards shutting down the system, if you ask me, if we’d continued down this path.” 
Leadership had to juggle several priorities at once, like building and retraining the workforce and leadership team, making signal improvements, getting delayed new subway cars on the tracks, tackling the dozens of dreaded speed restrictions that dragged several lines to a crawl, and building a better process to handle new slow zones quickly if they appear. 
“The idea is to not let it get back into that state of disrepair that we were facing,” Eng said, “and that’s why, this year, we continue to have diversions to actually bring the condition of that track to where we want it to be.” 
Last year, Eng said, the light and heavy rail system was at about 65 percent in a state of good repair, and by the end of this year he estimates the system will be 75 or 80 percent in a state of good repair. Frequency of service is up, he said, and the number of dropped bus trips is down to just 0.6 percent this spring from 8.8 percent in 2023. 
Eng emphasized that MBTA leadership is constantly keeping an eye out for service expansion and improvement opportunities – be that through boosting water transit or long-term changes to the commuter rail system as the T works on a new commuter rail operator contract.  
One lesson he brought with him from his postings in New York – including roles at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York State Department of Transportation – Eng said, is even if “mega-projects” are the focus of headlines, “the smaller projects that are out in the suburbs are just as important to those communities. And whether it’s 50 people or whether its millions of people, those transportation projects support quality of life, support housing, support businesses. It’s just a different magnitude.” 
During the episode, Eng talked about the overall state of the MBTA system (1:30),  balancing the needs of current riders with future ones (14:30), and the future of the commuter rail (16:00).

Rising electricity demands are fueling the push for more nuclear energy in multiple states. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.




We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Following the shooting death of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker in June, Assemblymember Mia Bonta wants to beef up a state law that would allow elected officials and candidates to spend an unlimited amount of campaign funds toward private security.
The Oakland Democrat is introducing legislation today that would temporarily remove through 2028 the $10,000 lifetime cap California lawmakers can currently spend of campaign money on security expenses for themselves, staff and family members. On Jan. 1, 2029, the limit would be reimplemented as a $10,000 annual cap. The bill makes no mention of restricting personal funds for security.

Bonta, in a statement: “Everyone should feel safe running for office and representing their community. However, local and state candidates in California face a significant cap on security spending compared to those running for federal offices. This (bill) comes at a time when we’re seeing an increase in threats and harassment…”

The existing cap was set last year, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed another bill by Bonta that doubled the amount of money legislators were allowed to use for security expenses. Besides Bonta, Democratic lawmakers at the time including Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City and Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco also reported receiving death threats.
Bonta’s latest proposal is backed by the influential Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat and the bill’s co-author. Because the measure would amend the voter-approved Political Reform Act of 1974, it requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate and Assembly to pass.
Threats of violence against political candidates have reportedly persisted after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, disproportionately affecting officials and candidates who are women, people of color or LGBTQ+. 
In addition to the killings of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were seriously wounded. Last year a bullet struck President Donald Trump’s ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. And in 2022 a man wielding a hammer attacked the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home.

CA prisons tried to help ICE before LA immigration raids

Last month the Trump administration touted that federal immigration enforcement agents captured some of “the worst illegal alien criminals in Los Angeles,” and accused California officials and protestors in L.A. of “fighting to keep … violent criminals loose.”
But state records and an analysis by CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Byrhonda Lyons reveal that the state had coordinated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an attempt to hand over the agency’s top targets in L.A. — undermining the administration’s justification for carrying out widespread immigration raids in the city.
In May, for example, state prison officials gave a heads up to ICE about the upcoming release of one of the federal agency’s top targets. Federal agents did not pick up the convicted sex offender, and so he was released. Two weeks later, ICE publicized his arrest in L.A.
California’s so-called sanctuary law does not shield unauthorized immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Since Newsom took office in 2019, state prisons have handed over more than 9,000 people with those backgrounds to ICE.

What’s next for CA’s polluted air?

California regulators must devise new methods to clean up the state’s air now that the Trump administration has limited their ability to enforce rules intended to combat air pollution, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Before the start of Trump’s second term, the state abandoned its rules for zero-emission trucks due to likely opposition from the incoming federal administration. Trump and Congress also eliminated tax credits for electric car buyers, and blocked three critical rules that would have banned the sale of new gas-powered cars in California and phased out diesel trucks.
But Californians still experience some of the worst air quality in the country — particularly Black and brown communities located near ports and highways — and the California Air Resources Board is struggling to come up with effective methods to solve the issue.
The state must now rely on voluntary agreements by companies to reduce emissions, and it lacks funds for a consumer incentive program to expand its electric vehicle market. The board’s updated fuel standards also faced strong opposition from the public, industry groups and some legislators, who’ve argued that regulations are driving up California’s cost of living.

But officials face growing pushback about affordability and costs.","In summary
With 7 of its most ambitious rules for cars, trucks and trains repealed, California officials now must find new ways to clean up the nation’s worst air pollution. But officials face growing pushback about affordability and costs.



At an electric vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Christopher Grundler — one of the top executives in California responsible for cleaning the air — said despite all the setbacks his agency has faced this year, he’s confident the state can keep making progress. 
“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won’t kill the electric truck, and they certainly won’t kill the California spirit.”
Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.
Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.
Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers. 
Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.
At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.
Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.
“There’s no one strategy that’s going to work. It’s really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,” she said.
The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.
Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.
“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice. 
“We just have to go it alone.”
Heart and lungs at stake
It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.
Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits. 





For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.  
But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.
John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.
Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government. 
“They’ve been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It’s been a priority. But, they haven’t really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.
Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and  then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.  
“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement. 
Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.
One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.
The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule. 
South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.
“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.
She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.  
What else can the state do?
Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company. 
Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether. 
But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.
“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.” 
The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.
“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.
“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.” 
Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”
Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.
“There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.” MARY NICHOLS, FORMER CHAIR OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD
Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No. 
The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.
In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.
“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we’re not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.” 
Tackling ‘pollution magnets‘
Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.
Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations.”BRENNON MENDEZ, UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot. 
These types of regulations “are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.
Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,” he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.
A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year. 
Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers. 
Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”
“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”

County activist impacted by the Chiquita Canyon Landfill.","Guest Commentary written by

Yasmina Valdivia
Yasmina Valdivia is an activist and longtime resident of Val Verde, a town in Los Angeles County.


The Los Angeles County community of Val Verde has been my home for 48 years. It’s where I grew up, where I raised my children and where my husband and I plan to retire. It used to be the kind of place where people said “hi” to each other on the street, kids rode their bikes around and you didn’t have to think twice about the air you were breathing. 
However, what used to be clean, breathable air is now filled with the stench and pollution coming from the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. Alarmingly, the air isn’t just unpleasant anymore — it’s toxic.
For years, my neighbors and I have been sounding the alarm over the noxious pollution being emitted by the landfill. Myself, and my friends and family, have experienced chronic symptoms like headaches, rashes, burning eyes and constant nausea. People complain of migraines, asthma attacks, stomach issues and even reproductive problems. 
California’s landfills also emit huge amounts of the highly pollutant greenhouse gas, methane, which are a major contributor to global warming. In 2023 alone, estimated methane emissions from California’s landfills were equivalent to more than 5 million cars on the road. Greenhouse gasses are exacerbating natural disasters, like the horrible January wildfires that the Los Angeles area is still recovering from.
There are people with the power to do something about this. The California Air Resources Board sets standards for how landfill operators find and control methane emissions. Those standards, called the Landfill Methane Rule, haven’t been updated since 2010. That’s 15 years ago. And while the air resources board is currently considering updates to the rules, they’re moving far too slow and trying to get away with the bare minimum.
CARB’s most recent proposed updates to landfill regulations fail to include basic, proven strategies that could protect our health and climate. A recent report by Industrious Labs found that making common-sense updates to how landfills operate could slash methane emissions in half by 2050. Reducing methane also means reducing dangerous co-pollutants that make people sick. 
One survey found that the vast majority of Val Verde residents experience frequent headaches. That’s not normal. And it’s only gotten worse — in 2024 alone, more than 14,000 complaints about the landfill were submitted to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
I’ve learned that, while Val Verde’s situation is devastating, it’s unfortunately not unique. There are over 300 landfills across the state, and many — like Newby Island in Milpitas, Clover Flat Landfill in Calistoga and Avenal Landfill in Avenal — have also been in the news for making nearby residents sick. That’s because landfills emit health-harming pollutants like benzene, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds. 
Like Val Verde, where nearly 60% of residents are Hispanic, communities of color are often the ones bearing the brunt of landfill pollution. It’s no coincidence that 70% of California’s highest-emitting landfills are located in these communities, a report by Industrious Labs found. Communities like mine are paying the price in doctor’s bills, in sick days, in missed school and in lives shortened by toxic exposure.
CARB could make a meaningful difference right now by requiring stronger landfill cover practices, making sure that more landfill gas is collected before it escapes into our atmosphere, and using established technology to find invisible methane leaks. 
These aren’t radical solutions — they’re affordable, effective and ready to go.  
Watching the people I love suffer pushed me into activism. I had no choice. I began speaking out — not just in my neighborhood but to elected officials and policymakers across all levels of government. I even shared my story with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year and testified in front of the air resources board earlier this year. 
Poor landfill management comes at a price, and communities across California have paid that price for too long. We’ve done our part — we’ve testified, we’ve suffered, we’ve waited. Now CARB needs to do its job and protect California communities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/02224_Chiquita-Canyon-Landfill_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

The House Committee on Education and Workforce has included two California universities so far this year on its invite list for hearings on antisemitism. In May, the president of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, outlined several steps the university is taking in response to antisemitism complaints. On July 9, the chancellor of UC Berkeley will address the committee.


A congressional committee trying to root out antisemitism in higher education across the country is continuing to scrutinize California universities. On June 26, the committee sent a letter to the president of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, following up on his recent testimony about actions he said the campus is taking in response to antisemitic acts that occurred there. On July 9, the president of UC Berkeley will answer to the committee in its next hearing.
University presidents are under increasing pressure to answer for what lawmakers are calling hate and discrimination toward Jewish students and faculty. While both Republican and Democratic committee members have denounced antisemitism during the hearings, some question where the line gets drawn between free speech and hate speech.
Many of the universities that have been called to testify before the House Committee on Education and Workforce are among the nation’s most elite schools. However, the Republican chair of the committee, Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, told CalMatters in a written statement that “antisemitism is a widespread problem across the country,” which is why the committee specifically chose Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo’s president Jeffrey Armstrong to testify on May 7.
“We sought out colleges that fit this criteria and offered diverse school settings across the country. We also sought out a balance of public and private schools. Cal Poly also had several incidents of antisemitism that stood out and were a concern to the Committee,” according to the statement attributed to Walberg, who his press team said did not have time for an interview.
The hearing placed Cal Poly in the national spotlight amid concerns over antisemitism on college campuses and heightened political scrutiny of higher education. Under former President Joe Biden, the House committee last year questioned university leaders across the country, including UCLA, about campus policies and safety after the Israel-Hamas war sparked protests on both sides of the issue. Three university presidents, from Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Columbia, resigned from their positions after testifying last year. 
So far this year, during President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Justice has formed a task force to investigate antisemitism on campuses, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and University of Southern California, and the House committee has announced investigations into at least nine universities. 
While no university leaders who have testified before the committee have resigned this year, the Trump administration has frozen federal funding to institutions for alleged antisemitism. Following the administration’s policy to deny research grants to universities that allow the boycott of Israel, UC President Michael Drake sent a letter to all campus officials on July 2 affirming that boycotts of businesses based on affiliations with any country are against UC policy. 
In May, Armstrong spoke before the House committee alongside officials from Haverford College and DePaul University. All three universities received “F” scores in March from the Anti-Defamation League, an international non-governmental, non-partisan organization that combats antisemitism. While other presidents in that hearing faced intense questioning, Armstrong talked for less than eight minutes of the three-hour hearing and did not receive the grilling his counterparts did. 
In a letter to Armstrong prior to the hearing, the House committee referenced the Anti-Defamation League’s report card, reports of Jewish students being verbally harassed, and graffiti on school buildings with phrases such as “From Gaza to Cal Poly, let the intifada spread.” 
The committee questioned Armstrong mostly about the extent of disciplinary action on his campus, while the other presidents were questioned deeper about what lawmakers described as the schools’ inaction as they received antisemitism complaints.   
“Calling for the death of any group or harassing or discriminating would be subject to discipline,” Armstrong said at the hearing. “For students, it could be suspension. If repeated, expulsion. We also have procedures for our faculty and staff that could result in discipline.”
Armstrong reported during the hearing that, as a result of acts the university deemed antisemitic in 2024, six students were disciplined ranging from suspension for two quarters to deferred suspension to probation.
Cal Poly’s report card was changed to “D” on April 4 after the university enacted policy changes. In a campuswide email on April 2, Armstrong announced the formation of an antisemitism task force, which will have its first meeting this fall. The task force will use data from a Jewish climate survey to draft a plan supporting Jewish life, antisemitism education and cultural awareness, according to the email. 
The university will also require mandatory student training on antisemitism awareness and endow a chair of Jewish studies. Armstrong reported during the testimony that the number of Jewish students at the campus has doubled since 2011. 
In his written statement to CalMatters, Walberg noted the follow-up letter the committee sent to Armstrong on June 26 asking for more details on these plans. “I will be curious to see whether these efforts help improve the well-being of Jewish students at Cal Poly,” Walberg wrote to CalMatters.
Cal Poly students speak up about antisemitism
Vandals spray-painted several phrases, including “divest from genocide,” on Cal Poly buildings on Halloween 2024. Avi Shapiro, a materials engineering senior, reported the graffiti to campus police after he heard about it from another student. The Cal Poly Police Department investigated the vandalism, but the case is not moving forward because of insufficient evidence, according to university spokesperson Matt Lazier.
“I think the university did a wonderful job with the incident,” said Shapiro, who is Jewish. “They were able to clean everything that night. The people that vandalized clearly wanted to get a message across.” 
Shapiro co-wrote a letter with another student to the House committee in support of Armstrong’s testimony. The local Chabad and Hillel groups also wrote a letter of support. 
“Many campuses have faced significant antisemitism, including Cal Poly,” San Luis Obispo Hillel Executive Director Lauren Bandari wrote in an email to CalMatters. “While it is deeply disappointing that this climate has necessitated congressional hearings, we look forward to continuing to work with the Cal Poly administration to ensure Jewish students feel as safe and welcome as any other student.”
Leora Feinsmith, a junior at Cal Poly studying public health, supports Armstrong’s efforts. As a Jewish student, she said she has not always felt comfortable sharing her identity with people around campus. She believes new campuswide initiatives could make a difference but it’s too soon to tell. 
“I think we’ll have to do a progress report and see if things are all talk or if things actually create action,” Feinsmith told CalMatters.
Feinsmith shared her concerns about antisemitism during the public comment session of the Cal State Board of Trustees meeting on May 20. 
“I expect better from the CSU system,” Feinsmith told the trustees. “Antisemitism is not a political issue. It’s about our basic dignity and right to feel safe on campus. So, look at us, listen to us. We are your students, and we’re hurting.”
The subpoena letter to Armstrong included a reference to one event in which an unnamed Cal Poly professor allegedly verbally harassed Jewish students on April 4, 2024 at a community Hillel and Mustangs United for Israel event. Adira Fogelman, a business sophomore at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, did not want to be interviewed for this story but sent a statement to CalMatters recalling the event. 
“[The professor] identified me as a Zionist and equated me to a member of the KKK,” Fogelman, who is Jewish, wrote to CalMatters, adding that the same professor – who she did not name – used profanity in reference to Israel and shoved a Palestinian flag in student’s faces. She reported the incident to the campus Civil Rights and Compliance Office. However, she said the process of reporting harassment is long and burdensome, which she believes discourages students from formally reporting incidents.
When asked for confirmation of this incident and whether the faculty member faced consequences, university spokesperson Lazier emailed this response: “Employee privacy concerns prevent the university from acknowledging or offering comment on specific pending personnel matters.”
Last year, universities including USC and UC San Diego had large pro-Palestinian encampments and protests that resulted in dozens of arrests. Both institutions have “C” scores from the Anti-Defamation League. UCLA had more than 200 arrests and received a “D.” Pro-Palestinian Cal Poly students and faculty protested the war in Gaza with demonstrations on campus that resulted in eight arrests last spring.
Pro-Palestinian students in California have also reported violence, harassment and intimidation. Notably, counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA in May 2024, resulting in injuries and national scrutiny about how the melee unfolded. Islamophobia has also affected college campuses since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. One study out of The University of Chicago showed that within three months of the start of the war, 56% of Jewish college students and 52% of Muslim college students felt personally in danger.
Defining antisemitism complicates campus policies
Questioning Israel’s right to exist may be considered antisemitism under the Trump administration. During his first term, Trump issued an executive order federally defining antisemitism to include certain forms of anti-Zionist expression, aligning with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s examples of antisemitism. One example includes criticism that denies “the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
Trump’s executive order says antisemitism may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, but does not cover discrimination based solely on religious belief. While the Department of Education has “interpreted Title VI to reach religious discrimination when it overlaps with race or national origin discrimination,” case law is sparse and inconsistent, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Violating the Title VI anti-discrimination law can result in loss of federal funding or legal action, according to the Library of Congress.But executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.
David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor, spoke at the May 7 House committee hearing by invitation from the Democratic representatives. He said members of the committee throughout the hearings repeatedly conflate any criticism of Israel or Zionism as discrimination, both of which are constitutionally protected.
He told the committee antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: when the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.
“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.” 
Even within non-profit organizations that combat antisemitism, Jewish scholars debate whether criticism of Israel is antisemitic. The Nexus Project holds that criticism of Israel should not be seen as necessarily antisemitic, while Stand With Us believes much of what is labeled “criticism of Israel” is actually rooted in antisemitism.
The Nexus Project’s campus guide for identifying antisemitism deems the term “intifada,” which means “shaking off” in Arabic, as not antisemitic on its face. The guide explains that the term has come to mean “resistance to oppression and especially Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.” Further, if the term intifada is referring to the removal of all Jews in Israel, then it would be antisemitic.
UC Berkeley associate professor of history and Jewish studies Ethan Katz was on the task force that created the Nexus guide, and he says that slogans like “let the intifada spread” will disproportionately impact Jewish community members. Katz acknowledged the emotional impact such language can have on Jewish communities. At the same time, he expressed concern that some efforts to address antisemitism are being politicized.
“I am sure that there are people involved in holding these hearings who care about antisemitism on campus and are understandably enraged by things that they’ve seen happen over the last 18 months,” Katz said. However, he thinks that “the overarching motivation for many of these people is to use this as a way of attacking higher education. This means that they are using Jews as a kind of pawn to play a political game.”
The American Jewish Committee recently released a statement in support of the federal government investigating antisemitism on college campuses. Still, the committee warns that actions against campuses, like canceling research grants and shutting down academic freedom, have become too broad and could imperil innovation and detract from the fight against antisemitism. 
During the May 7 congressional hearing, many of the Democratic representatives on the House committee questioned whether the federal administration could effectively address antisemitism and other forms of discrimination on campus if the Office of Civil Rights is closed. The office operates under the U.S. Department of Education, which Trump has called for dismantling. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, said of the 12,000 current Office of Civil Rights complaints, only 144 relate to discrimination based on national origin involving religion, which includes antisemitism. 
A federal judge blocked the Trump administration on May 22 from firing Department of Education employees, saying this is an act only Congress can do, and called for hiring back over 2,000 employees.

Universities navigate federal scrutiny
Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in funding for Harvard and other institutions due to their handling of campus activism and antisemitism. The Department of Education is investigating dozens of universities for antisemitic discrimination and harassment. 
Leaders from over 600 universities around the country have signed a joint statement from the American Association of Colleges and Universities and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference,” including nine of 10 UC chancellors and 14 of 23 Cal State presidents. The UC system President Michael Drake signed, but the Cal State system Chancellor Mildred Garcia did not. 
Armstrong declined to sign the statement because Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo has no role in determining public policy, according to Lazier, the university spokesperson. A letter signed by 284 faculty members urged Armstrong to publicly support Harvard and sign the statement. 
UC Berkeley’s chancellor did sign the statement. When Lyons testifies before the House committee in July, he will appear alongside top officials from Georgetown University and The City University of New York. Both UC Berkeley and the House committee denied CalMatters’ request for the letter sent to Lyons requesting his appearance and outlining key concerns.
In his statement to CalMatters, the committee chair Walberg noted only that “The July 9th hearing will focus on the factors underlying antisemitic upheaval and hatred on campus. Until these factors—such as foreign funding and antisemitic student and faculty groups—are addressed, antisemitism will persist. Several of these factors have long been present at Berkeley, and Berkeley has failed to effectively respond.”
UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof sent a written response to CalMatters acknowledging the campus is dealing with antisemitism and needs to combat it. He wrote, “Chancellor Lyons looks forward to testifying before the committee to share how the campus has been investing, and continues to invest, in resources and programs designed to prevent and address antisemitism on the Berkeley campus.”

Audrey S. Heinrichs-A Celebration of Life
It is with sorrow that we announce Audrey Heinrichs’ passing on June 25, 2025 at the age of 97. She was held in high respect. Audrey’s final home after a busy life of academia, personal and professional accomplishment and devoted family, including husband, four sons, 10 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren, was at the Greensboro Nursing Home in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. We thank the nursing home and NC Home Health and Hospice for their excellent care.
Mom earned a PhD in Education from the University of Illinois. She was a seasoned educator, and a teacher of teachers. As a University level professor, Mom contributed materially to the quality of education in her home districts.
A believer in the power of early education, Mom spent many hours reading to us, her children, at home. She came from a generation who believed that with a quality education, the ability to read and write well, a solid family background, a person could achieve great things. An early advocate for women’s rights, Mom pushed past the barriers that held women back in the 1970’s and 80’s. Opportunity awaited those who worked hard for it. Over the years she positively influenced literally hundreds of students, both men and women, with her skills and enthusiasm.
One of her great joys in life was her family. She invested herself in the lives of her kin, hosting family gatherings in Shoreham. She played a major role in the editing and production of her husband Waldo’s books. One of those books (Implacable Foes; co-written with Mark Gallicchio; Oxford University Press, 2017) won the Bancroft Award for Historical Writing from Columbia University.  Waldo pre-deceased her in 2019 after nearly 70 years of marriage. Son Timothy, also a PhD in History, predeceased her in the fall of 2024.
Mom was highly skilled at many things. She played golf, she was a Master knitter, and she loved square dancing. She understood gardening and flower growing very well. Her home in Shoreham VT had lovely Peonies, Iris, and Hollyhocks.
Her daughters-in-law felt accepted and embraced. Her grandchildren’s lives were enriched by books and magazines and visits to museums. She actively sought ways to enhance and vitalize her relationships with her grandchildren. We would get lovely letters and cards signed Mom/Audrey/Granny underlining her multi-dimensional family ties.
Mom had challenges as well. She lost the ability to read because of blindness later in life and her hearing deteriorated as she aged. Mom was a great mother and outstanding educational professional and will be sorely missed.

While New Mexico's share of lead pipes in public water systems is estimated to be low, about one-third of water systems failed to turn in surveys of the issue for an October 2024 deadline. (Courtesy of ABCWUA)Just over one-third of water systems failed to submit surveys to the State of New Mexico regarding the status of lead pipes in their water systems, despite a federal October 2024 deadline.
In 2023, the federal government tightened the limits on lead in drinking water and passed a new rule mandating that states replace all lead service lines in drinking water systems within a decade. The rule is fully in effect in 2027, at which point states will be required to submit replacement plans to address all lead pipes by 2037.
Cities, states say they’ll need more help to replace millions of lead pipes

The rule required cities and smaller water systems to start inventories of their water lines, and to submit them to state regulators by October 2024. The state currently does not have enforcement power, which lies with the federal government. Between April and June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is in charge of the rule, issued warning letters to the water systems.
The letters contained boilerplate notice of the failure to comply with the rule and requested water systems contact the EPA for further assistance.
Further enforcement may come down the line from federal officials, according to Muna Habib, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Environment Department, in the form of administrative orders, which will not include fines, but are more “like formal instructions to take corrective action,” she said in an email.
A 2023 EPA report estimated New Mexico has about 15,400 lead service lines —  less than 1% of the state’s pipes — projecting the replacement costs to be about $1.6 billion.
New Mexico efforts to catalog lead water lines off to ‘slow start’ as federal money flows in

So far, of the 462 water systems that submitted surveys, none reported any lead pipes to the New Mexican Environment Department, officials said.
But there’s a catch, said Martin Torrez, who directs the Public Water Supervision System at NMED: The survey allowed water systems to identify all of their pipes as made from “unknown” materials.
“Now [the systems] have to do their due diligence to investigate and to identify that material by 2027,” Torrez said. “So I would say we’re still in that phase; the majority of the water systems in New Mexico have identified their lines as unknowns.”
About 37% of the lines in New Mexico’s surveys were confirmed not to have lead, according to the surveys.
Lead and copper were common materials in household plumbing, but corrosion of the pipes or joinings could expose people to lead in their water— which is unsafe in any amount, especially for children, pregnant people, and the elderly.
The federal government banned the use of lead for plumbing in 1986, but many older homes and water systems still use lead pipes. In 2023, the EPA identified about 9 million lead service lines used for drinking water in the U.S. with a$625 billion price tag— conservatively — to address the issue.
Officials at the state’s largest water systems, Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, said they don’t anticipate finding many lead pipes across the water system.
“Many lines owned by the Water Authority have already been replaced,” said ABCWUA Compliance Manager Danielle Shuryn. “Evidence so far indicates that lead pipes were not prevalent in any parts of the service area.
About half of the system’s 200,000 water lines were installed before 1988, and about 10% have already been inspected by staff, she said, but noted the actual survey will possibly take all 10 years to complete.

Officials with Alabama's medical cannabis regulator and licensed producers are optimistic about the start of medical cannabis production in the state after a recent series of court rulings.  (Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector))CULLMAN — From the outside, it appears to be another one of over 1,500 farms in Cullman County, with a couple of facilities and a structure that will eventually serve as a greenhouse. The front office looks — and smells — like any other office space, with their current hemp-derived products on display and a couple of private offices behind a conference table.
But when Joey Robertson, CEO and president of Wagon Trail Med-Serv and a managing partner at Wagon Trail Hemp Farms, opens a door behind the front office, an herbal and skunky smell blows out, strong enough to leave one’s senses feeling overwhelmed.
That’s where Robertson produces hemp-derived products like gummies,  which he has been doing since 2019.
“It’s been essentially the exact fall-in-line with what we’re going to be doing on medical, minus some infrastructure improvements and a bigger fence, so we’re already ready to roll,” Robertson said during a tour of his facility last month.
The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission awarded Robertson an integrated facility license in 2023, meaning he can grow, process and sell products under one license. But Alabama’s medical cannabis program, approved by the Legislature in 2021, remains stalled, meaning Robertson has multimillion-dollar machinery sitting idly.
“We’ve been able to carry or offset most of our losses, though, with hemp,” he said. “So it’s made it to where hemp was hard to thrive, I guess you would say, because we’re turning so much back into keeping that (medical cannabis) license opportunity open.”.
After over two years of legal wrangling over the licensing process — and over four years after the Alabama Legislature first approved the medical cannabis program  — state officials and cannabis producers like Robertson think they’re moving closer to making cannabis available for patients throughout the state, thanks in part to recent state appellate court rulings.

(Andi Rice for The Alabama Reflector)
“I think the commission and the staff are more encouraged than we have been any time in the past to date,” said Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC) Director John McMillan, saying he is “kind of coming around to being very hopeful” that medical cannabis could be available to Alabamians by the end of 2025, though he stressed that is a best case scenario.
But there are still many obstacles ahead, including ongoing legal battles and strong opinions regarding the program’s structure and fairness.
Marty Schelper, founder and president of the Alabama Cannabis Coalition and Alabama Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, said she was skeptical about the entire program, saying potential patients may turn to a potentially cheaper black market even when the program has been rolled out.
Schelper, who called the medical cannabis framework a “legal medical cannabis cartel,” said she believes that the current system is designed to control and regulate the industry by limiting competition, allowing license holders to “set their price on whatever your product is, because you have none of the competition.”
“They created the Alabama medical cannabis cartel, and they’re not allowed free markets, and that’s why they can’t implement medical cannabis in the state of Alabama,” Schelper said.
But others are sounding optimistic. Ray French, CEO for Specialty Medical Products of Alabama, a company that won a license in each of the attempted rounds, said that integrated operators who can grow, process and sell the final product, like his own business, will be able to start operating within “a few weeks, once the commission completes their process,” as they are already operational and possess the necessary equipment and certifications.

A stalled program

The Alabama medical cannabis law, enacted in 2021, allows registered physicians to recommend cannabis for specific qualifying conditions. The approved product forms are restricted to tablets, tinctures, patches, oils, and gummies (only peach flavor), with raw plant material and smokable forms remaining prohibited.
When the program is fully operational, there will be up to 37 dispensaries across the state. After the licensees have operated dispensaries for at least a year, the commission may allow licensees to open additional dispensaries.
Robertson said they plan to operate dispensaries in Cullman, Decatur, Florence, Athens and Montgomery, though he said that dispensary locations are subject to change. He said that some cities have a higher concentration of planned dispensaries compared to more rural parts of the state.
“So working with the commission, if they allow for us change and really cover more of the state, which I feel like they will, people get more coverage in medicine,” Robertson said.
But the licensing process, which began in 2023, has been contentious. The commission’s first round of license awards in June of that year was withdrawn amid controversy over the scoring of applications. A second round of awards later that year was put on hold because of allegations that the AMCC violated the Open Meetings Act. The commission awarded licenses at the end of 2023, but those have been caught up in litigation.
The AMCC has already issued licenses in several categories, but integrated facility and dispensary licenses, which are required before doctors can be certified and allowed to recommend products to patients, have been on hold due to the ongoing litigation.
But the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals in May overturned a permanent injunction imposed by Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Anderson in April that blocked the last round of licensing because it was awarded under emergency rules.
The month prior, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals overturned a temporary restraining order that prevented the commission from issuing licenses due to allegedly not complying with the Administrative Procedure Act, saying that Anderson lacked jurisdiction when it issued a stay in favor of Alabama Always, a company seeking a medical cannabis license, and dismissed the case.
A more recent lawsuit was brought by five parents who want the court to order the AMCC to establish a patient registry for medical cannabis patients. A scheduled hearing on the case was postponed late last month; as of Thursday morning, it had not been rescheduled.
All that remains for the commission to do before finalizing awards, said McMillan, is to conduct investigative hearings, which can be called by any applicant in the license category.
“We have notified the applicants that are eligible to participate as they want to, and then we’ve turned it over to the administrative law judge,” McMillan said, “We’re totally out of it, no communication, no nothing. It’s between him and the applicants now.”

But McMillan was vague about a timeline for the hearings, saying that several factors could influence it.
“It’ll depend on how many of the applicants want to participate in the hearing, and then how long it takes the administrative law judge to do the preparatory work for having the hearings and then to actually have the hearing,” McMillan said.
Robertson said at an interview he feels that is a reasonable prediction. He said his integrated facility, which includes an outdoor greenhouse and indoor growing facility, as well as processing and production facilities, is ready to begin operations as soon as he receives final approval.
Because cannabis plants can take months to grow, he plans to first procure raw plant material from cultivators, whose licenses have been approved and have been growing cannabis since the first half of 2024, to make the first few rounds of products.
“We want to be that option for people to be able to bring their biomass to us. We can convert it to oil products– either purchase it from them to resell or to produce their products for them to sell in the independent dispensaries,” Robertson said.
He said that with cannabis plants having been growing in the state since cultivators received their final licenses, the remaining steps can be completed within a month.
Because he is also a managing partner of Wagon Trail Hemp Farms, where they have been making seed-to-sale hemp-derived products since 2019, he also believes he won’t have much of a learning curve. The facility, he said, can process 1,000 pounds of raw plant material per day, which translates to about 80 kilos of oil daily.
“That’s enough oil for the entire state of Alabama. That’s enough to produce 3.5 million doses in one day’s worth of oil,” Robertson said.
Once they have the oil processed and tested, the production process is quite quick. They can produce 30,000 to 40,000 gummies in one shift.
Ongoing litigation

But lawsuits have continued. Will Somerville, an attorney representing Alabama Always, one of the firms that sued AMCC after not receiving a license, said in an interview in May the hearings should be conducted on a “level playing field,” saying that applicants initially chosen in December 2023 should not receive an unfair advantage.
There is a strong belief that some licenses were awarded to those who did not “raise as much of a stink about the process” as others, Somerville said, a practice he believes to be illegal and discriminatory.
“I think that’s why they rewarded the people who sucked up to them,” Somerville said. “I don’t think there’s any other basis for awarding those licenses.”
French, of Specialty Medical Products of Alabama, called those claims “unbelievable.” He said that his company is well qualified, with extensive experience in the hemp industry in Alabama. He currently also owns Oscity Labs, which produces CBD edibles and tinctures in an integrated facility.
The facilities, he said, have been certified as having Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP), a set of regulations enforced by the FDA to ensure products are consistently manufactured under controlled and healthy conditions.
“We feel like we are not only a qualified applicant in all ways, but we are one of the handful of operators that are actually already CGMP’ed. I mean, that’s a huge lift,” French said.
Alabama Always has also filed a federal lawsuit alleging the AMCC commissioners showed bias and acted against those who challenged the process. Somerville said the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of the commission’s misconduct and its impact on its clients, with monetary damages potentially on the table, but he doesn’t foresee it stalling the process further.
“We don’t think a lot of these commissioners have the ability to be impartial,” Somerville said, saying the lawsuit is intended to ensure the process moves along according to the law. A hearing has not been set on the lawsuit.
McMillan said that the timeline for making medical cannabis available also depends on how many applicants participate in the investigative hearings process and how long the administrative law judge takes to prepare and conduct them.

French said the appeals court’s decision to overturn the restraining order was “very encouraging news.”
But the delays can be financially straining for applicants as they wait to begin production.  French said “keeping employees operational, keeping operations going” has been a challenge, as well as maintaining expensive facilities without being able to sell products.
Robertson predicted that he would come out even in about two years after investing $4 million into the facilities. Because of the delays, he said that it could be four years before he is able to break even.
“Between the legal fees and operational fees, and holding all of the facilities and everything else, it’s been a multimillion-dollar venture at this point. We have $4 million of infrastructure sitting here, and we can’t do anything with it, and then we’ve got all the other operations and legal fees,” Robertson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ALR_061125_Selects-29-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

In May, NV Energy agreed to pay Baker $30,000 for the damage caused by the removal of trees and brush deemed by the utility to be fire hazards to electricity lines and utility infrastructure. Now, the company is off the hook for what Baker and others call widespread ecological harm.
“It was a complete blindside,” Baker said upon learning the settlement prompted the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to close its case on a complaint she filed last year against the utility. “I did not understand at all that by agreeing to settle I would not be able to have the PUC hold NV Energy accountable for the damage to the adjoining riparian area and all other riparian areas.”
Nevada Administrative Code says if a complaint has been settled and the PUC has been notified, “the Commission will dismiss the complaint.”
Baker says she intends to file another complaint regarding U.S. Forest Service land adjacent to her property. She says it’s been “horrifying” to watch the utility, with the assistance of the Forest Service, “take trees above the prescribed size that we cannot grow back and do not have the climate conditions to grow back.”
The work is part of NV Energy’s Resilience Corridor Project, a $21 million effort to “create resilient forests adjacent to approximately 28 miles of NV Energy utility infrastructure on the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin.”
Like Baker, no one informed David Simon that the Forest Service, on behalf of NV Energy, intended to thin the trees surrounding his home a mile from the lake. 
“If they had, I wouldn’t have thought twice about it,” Simon, a retired attorney, told the Current in 2023. “Whereas, if somebody tells you, ‘hey, we’re going to take out 90% of the trees in your forest, you’d not only take notice, you’d start taking action.”
Simon, like his neighbors, learned of NV Energy’s Resilience Corridors project when a wide swath of cedars, pines, and other massive trees vanished from his home’s view. 
Baker and neighbors contend the utility and the Forest Service are exceeding the parameters of the project, which calls for removing trees and brush “immediately adjacent to utility infrastructure” and thinning the forest up to 1,000 feet from utility equipment “to improve forest health, remove trees that could grow into or fall on power lines and reduce hazardous fuels.”
“This is clearcutting. Commercial logging,” says Baker, pointing to “ancient trees” felled by the utility and the Forest Service. 
“Riparian fuels, such as mature aspen trees, will be removed only if they have the potential to grow into the utility infrastructure,” says the U.S. Forest Service’s Decision Memo, which notes trees of more than 30 inches in diameter would be removed only with the approval of a Forest Service biologist in the event it is a safety hazard, infested with insects, or in the way of equipment.

“Many of the trees felled were certainly over 30 inches,” Tahoe Area Sierra Club co-chair Tobi Tyler wrote in 2023 to NV Energy, the Forest Service, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and the Tahoe Douglas Fire Protection District, adding that “photos show that thesespecifications were not followed, there were no buffers in place and wholesale destruction of wetland and riparian corridors occurred.”
The project, Tyler complained, “did nothing to improve the environment or make the forest more resilient and the public safer. In reality, this was and continues to be a commercial logging operation sanctioned as a ‘forest resiliency’ project.”
In response, the utility and the agencies agreed to increase notifications to the public, abide by best management practices, and facilitate communication among contractors. 
“Whether they are following through on these things, I’m not sure,” Tyler said Wednesday.  
NV Energy, in a statement to the Current, said it has taken steps in recent years to improve communication with customers in areas where deforestation crews are working. 
“Last year, we hired a dedicated customer communications specialist for work that happens within the natural disaster protection program,” the utility’s spokeswoman Meghin Delaney said via email. “This role, among other duties, coordinates direct outreach to customers, responds to media, and helps organize and attend community events to provide education and outreach to the communities we serve.”
Given her service as chairperson of the PUC and as a member of the TRPA, Tahoe resident Hayley Williamson has unique insight into the project, as well as the state regulation that prevents the PUC from holding the utility accountable when a complaint is settled, however, she declined to be interviewed, given the potential for the issue to come before the PUC in the future.
America’s forests are increasingly subject to commercial logging, and much of it occurs with little oversight.  The NV Energy project, under federal law, is excluded from requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The same exclusion would apply to deforestation efforts under the Fix Our Forests Act, federal legislation which seeks to increase forest management through thinning and prescribed burns. The bill is supported by all of Nevada’s congressional delegates, with the exception of Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Las Vegas.
“Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input,” Tyler wrote in a recent opinion piece. “To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.”
The bill, says Tyler, “advances a deeply flawed narrative that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise.”
Climate change, not tree density, “is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West,” Tyler wrote. “Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive.”
Studies, Tyler noted, indicate measures such as creating defensible space around structures and hardening buildings against fire, offer more protection to communities.
“FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies,” Tyler wrote. “Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.”
Some scientists are at odds with what they deem an alliance among governments, electric utilities, and the commercial logging industry under the guise of fire management. Archaic methods that are futile in controlling fire are wreaking ecological havoc and exacerbating risks for people and property, they say.
“The Forest Service uses the term ‘thinning and fuel reduction,’ a euphemism for commercial logging,’” says Dr. Chad Hanson, an ecologist and vocal critic of traditional fire management practices at a time when climate change has increased fire severity. “What they’re really doing is selling and removing large, commercially valuable trees on a fairly significant scale. Not only does that fail to protect homes, it will actually make a fire spread faster, and often more intensely toward the homes.”
The vast majority of homes that burn in wildfires – about 90% – are ignited by embers, carried on the winds, sometimes from miles away in advance of the flames, experts say. Logging reduces canopy cover and windbreak. 
“What you get are hotter, drier, and windier conditions that are more conducive to moving rapid wildfire toward homes,” Hanson says.
“The benefits of harvesting timber extend way beyond a healthy forest and reducing hazardous fuels. Timber harvesting also supports jobs and businesses in the local community,” Brad Seaberg, timber sale contracting officer for the Tahoe National Forest, said in 2023. “When forest land is properly managed, forests have both economic and ecological benefits. Regular thinning provides an improved environment for maximizing a site’s growth potential, which results in larger, healthier trees and more valuable timber.” 
The Forest Service did not respond by publication to requests for comment, or for data on the amount and value of the timber removed from the Tahoe forest.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3447-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)When a 24-year-old Bishopville City Council member cruised to victory last month in a special election for a House seat, he got a lot of attention from Democrats nationwide.
However, while Keishan Scott is currently the youngest legislator, his age didn’t set any firsts in the General Assembly for either party.
Former GOP Gov. David Beasley was first elected in 1978 to the state House at only 21 (as a Democrat). Even younger, by months, was former state Sen. Sherry Shealy Martschink, a Mount Pleasant Republican in her junior year at the University of South Carolina when she was first elected in 1970.
Legislators can’t be any younger: The state constitution sets 21 as the youngest age for representatives and 25 for senators.
Being a 20-something legislator comes with scrutiny, sometimes a youthful arrogance and often being mistaken for a staffer, former and current lawmakers told the SC Daily Gazette.
But by showing a seriousness to do the job, it doesn’t take long to earn respect, they said in offering advice to the newest legislator.

“You hang out like they hang out,” said former Rep. Bakari Sellers, who was 22 when first elected to the state House in 2006.
‘What the young guy had to say’
That year, Sellers ousted the chamber’s oldest member, then-82-year-old Thomas Rhoad, in the Democratic primary to become the youngest.
The USC law student from rural Denmark wasn’t even born when Rhoad was first elected in 1982.
When Sellers’ first session started in January 2007, he felt like everyone was watching him, he told the Gazette.
“Some people wanted to hear what the young guy had to say,” said Sellers, who became a CNN commentator after losing a bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. But within months, he was treated like every other member, he said.
The first two weeks on the job are crucial, Sellers explained.
“I spent mine doing the most important thing: building relationships,” he said.
And by 2009, then-House Speaker Bobby Harrell decided to place Sellers on the chamber’s powerful Judiciary Committee. Sellers thought it was ironic that he was still in law school while sitting on the committee that handles criminal and constitutional proposals, as well as anything relating to the judicial system.
“He just felt like I had the capacity and being in law school … he knew I had a willingness and appreciation” for that role, Sellers said.
In 2008, Boyd Brown was elected to the House, also at age 22. He and Sellers were desk mates for a time.
Brown, whose great-grandfather and grandfather both served in the Statehouse, decided in 2007 to run for the seat representing Fairfield and Chester counties. At the time, he was finishing his junior year at USC. He crammed classes and was able to graduate that December.
That “gave me the whole spring to campaign and knock on doors,” he said.
When the Winnsboro Democrat was sworn in, he was the youngest legislator. And he acted like it, he said. He developed a reputation for being outspoken and unafraid to make the occasional personal attack.
Toward the end of his two terms in the House, he brought his father to the Statehouse to prove he was not “the spawn of Satan,” The State newspaper reported.
“My personal style back then was to make myself known,” he said. “I was young, brash, and a member of the minority party.”
While the 2024 elections gave the GOP supermajority control of both chambers, back in 2008, the partisan divide wasn’t so lopsided. The parties had to work together more, particularly to get something through the more-evenly split Senate.
In the House, Brown was among 51 Democrats in the 124-member chamber. (With Scott’s special election to replace a Democrat, Republicans maintained their 88-to-36 advantage.)
Brown’s job, as he puts it, “was to throw rocks” at the other party.
He left his seat in 2012 to focus on finishing law school. Now 38, Brown is a lobbyist at the Statehouse and has had to ask some lawmakers not to “hold 22-year-old me against 38-year-old me.”
Mistaken identity
In Brown’s first week at the Statehouse, then-Rep. Nikki Haley, who became governor two years later, asked him to get her a cup of coffee, confusing him for a legislative page, which drew laughs from multiple people.
“I probably should have done it. I kind of made a joke about not being page, saying ‘I’m a member just like you are,” said Brown, adding it wasn’t the only time he was mistaken for a staffer.
When Brandon Newton was elected to the House in 2016, also at age 22, he too was confused for a page.
A couple of his college friends actually were pages when he walked in as a legislator.
That’s why the Lancaster Republican wasn’t taken aback when former Rep. Joe McEachern asked Newton to get him a cup of Joe. His reaction was to say “yes” and talk with the Richland County Democrat for a few minutes.
In the next election, McEachern was ousted in the Democratic primary by a 26-year-old USC law student. And Newton has risen in GOP ranks to assistant majority leader. Earlier this year, he helped launch the bipartisan South Carolina Future Caucus, a coalition of millennials and Generation Z lawmakers aiming to bridge partisan divides.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said when he was campaigning for the 2007 special election that first sent him to the Statehouse, his youthful appearance at age 32 caused some voters to jokingly question whether he even had a driver’s license.
The Edgefield Republican said that during his first year in the Senate, a security guard stopped him as he was walking over to the House, saying, “Senate pages aren’t allowed on the House floor.”

“I don’t think I’d be confused for a Senate page anymore,” Massey said.
When he joined the Senate, a chamber where seniority rules, Massey said his colleagues questioned him because of his youth.
“You have to prove yourself more,” he said, adding “they question if this person has enough life experience.”
But Massey made sure people knew he was ready and willing to work.
“If you demonstrate you have the ability, the older guys, the more senior members will allow you to participate,” he said. “I certainly wasn’t punished for my age.”
When Republicans elected Massey their majority leader in 2016, at age 40, they wanted someone who represented a younger generation. He replaced Sen. Harvey Peeler, first elected in 1980, who unexpectedly stepped down from the leadership role after 11 years. Massey was Peeler’s caucus whip.
In a social media post after the leadership vote, Peeler — the chamber’s chief budget writer since 2022 — referenced the movie “Karate Kid,” saying Massey had been the “‘Mr. Miyagi’ to his ‘Daniel-san.’ He is prepared.”
Being a 30-something senator isn’t so unusual anymore.
When Deon Tedder, a Charleston Democrat, won a special election to the Senate in November 2023 at age 33, he was the youngest senator — but not for long. Republican JD Chaplin of Darlington took the title with his November 2024 election at age 30, when he ousted a 22-year incumbent Democrat.
Now 31, Chaplin told the Gazette he didn’t reveal his age during his first session unless someone asked.
Advice 
Asked what advice they have for the 24-year-old Scott as he enters the Statehouse next year, the former and current youngsters of the Statehouse offered similar suggestions:
Learn the rules and processes of the Legislature, get to know colleagues on a personal — not just political — level, and remember that it’s your duty to represent the people who elected you there.
“It’s going to be pretty awe-inspiring … just do the job and stay in touch with the people back home,” said Massey.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SC20-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

John Lewis was released from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman.","JULY 7, 1961

Future U.S. Rep. John Lewis was released after 40 days from Mississippi’s most notorious prison, the State Penitentiary at Parchman. Jackson police arrested him and other Freedom Riders who entered a “whites-only” area of the bus station and refused to move on. 
After Lewis, a son of sharecroppers, learned about the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott, he decided to attend the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, where he embraced the nonviolence philosophy.
 One of the original 13 Freedom Riders, he entered the “whites-only” waiting room in Rock Hill, South Carolina — only to become the target of an attack. Two weeks later, he joined another Freedom Ride, this one bound for Jackson, Mississippi. When he and other riders arrived in Montgomery, Alabama, an angry mob attacked them, striking Lewis in the head with a wooden crate. 
“I thought I was going to die,” he recalled.
In 1963, he delivered a fiery speech at the March on Washington. Two years later, he led the demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, which helped propel passage of the Voting Rights Act. In 1986, he was elected to Congress and, not long after, he proposed an African-American museum in the nation’s capital. In 2003, the bill finally passed Congress, and the president signed it. 
In 2011, he received the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and five years later, he won the National Book Award for the third installment of his graphic novel, “March.” 
“I grew up in rural Alabama, very poor, very few books in our home,” he told the crowd gathered. “I remember in 1956, when I was 16 years old, going to the public library to get library cards, and we were told the library was for whites only and not for coloreds. And to come here and receive this honor, it’s too much.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102323/July7-JohnLewis-IMG_9541-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

And Sen. Thom Tillis still has a full year-and-a-half left in office. (Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)From the beginning of his tenure in the North Carolina General Assembly, it’s always been evident that Thom Tillis was not a true right-wing, authoritarian extremist.
Arch-conservative – especially on matters of taxes and economic policy? Yes. Ready to pare the social safety net to the bone and “divide and conquer” the various groups of people who find themselves relying upon it to maintain a semblance of economic security? Certainly. Happy to ram through a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while forecasting that its demise was inevitable? Sure. Willing to swallow his pride and abandon basic personal values on a regular basis in order to assuage an above average case of political ambition? Absolutely.
But a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool, Trump and Putin-loving, immigrant-hating, LGBTQ-bashing, white/Christian nationalist MAGA-believer? No way.
Like a lot of modern conservative Republicans, Tillis has certainly blown with the winds that overtook his party the last couple of decades. And he’s probably embraced a number of positions and policies that he would have found surprising back in his early 40’s, when he commenced his political career by running for a local park board position in order to champion a public bike path.
But as he made clear on multiple occasions while serving in the North Carolina House and during his 10-plus years in Washington, Tillis’s political values and instincts were and are much more in line with the rapidly withering Bush/McCain/Romney branch of Republicanism than the Trump-as-flawless-Dear-Leader cult. While he regularly caved in to the demands of the bully-in-chief and his hench-people (on immigration, on foreign policy, on advancing unqualified buffoons to court seats and cabinet positions), you knew they were always moves of calculated – some would say cowardly — political expedience. The Trump people knew this too and clearly never trusted him.
This past weekend, Tillis finally reached his limit. Faced with voting for one of the most monstrously destructive legislative proposals in American history — a bill that will wreak havoc on his state and further empower a man who openly aspires to become a national dictator – Tillis made clear there was a limit to how far down the Trump cult rabbit hole he was ultimately willing be dragged. By voting against the president’s disastrous mega-bill and then quickly announcing his decision not to seek reelection next year, Tillis appears to have taken a big step in officially severing ties with the sect and recapturing a small sense of who he is and what he believes as he contemplates his final 18 months in office.
Of course, as mental health experts will attest, leaving a cult — like overcoming an addiction — can be a complicated, up-and-down process. This is especially true for disillusioned former true believers.
Fortunately, in this case, Tillis’s departure seems more akin to that of someone who knew all along that they needed to get away from a controlling and abusive leader, but just hated the thought of being ostracized by the community they so long inhabited and the ideals that many members of the group still nominally professed – not to mention giving up a position of political power.
But as other Republicans like former Congresswoman Liz Cheney have discovered, there can be life beyond the cult. What’s more, and this is important, unlike Cheney whose time in Congress almost immediately ended after she bravely dared to cross Trump, Tillis is now a free man with a full year-and-a-half left in office to do and say what he believes, and maybe just maybe, to convince other disaffected Republican lawmakers who know the emperor is naked to, at least occasionally, join him.
Indeed, with partisan margins so razor thin on Capitol Hill, Tillis now has the opportunity to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina since Sam Ervin helped spearhead the demise of Richard Nixon a half-century ago.
For instance, as University of Richmond law professor and judiciary watcher Carl Tobias told NC Newsline Sunday, now that he’s free from reelection concerns, Tillis is well-positioned to stymie some of Trump’s looniest court nominees from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee – a body in which the GOP holds only a 12-10 advantage.
If only Tillis had had his epiphany before caving on the execrable nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary.
Could all of this be wishful thinking? Maybe.
Blood runs thick and Tillis has already taken to social media to say that he wants a Republican to win his seat next year. But given the state of the North Carolina GOP, that will ultimately mean supporting a craven Trump toady who will be commanded to specifically condemn Tillis, so who knows how enthusiastically he’ll stick to that stance?
Whatever the state of Senator Tillis’s psyche at what is no doubt a difficult personal moment, he’s clearly come to a fork in the road on the overriding issue of our times: Trumpism. In one direction lies the rocky path of strength, honor, morality and making an important difference for the nation’s future that would be long remembered. Down the other lies the path of acquiescence, personal ease and comfort, and utter political and historical irrelevance. Stay tuned.

Of course, this would be normalized like any other male paranoia. Movies would feature cops staring down criminals, their cold gazes intercut with their bears’ faces. There would be bear sections at sporting goods stores, with staff available to describe the reach and quality of each grizzly on sale. Your Facebook page would be flooded with AI-generated images showing Good Guys with a bear stopping Bad Guys with a bear.
This isn’t a world you would want to live in. Grizzly bears weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, have terrifyingly powerful bites, and can outrun human beings with surprising speed.
But what would that matter? In this world, as in ours, the ability of some to legally commit violence against others is the only “freedom” not subject to judicial veto. People always have reasons to justify bear ownership. And when one reason fails, they grab another. Any ursine restriction is viewed with abhorrence. Licensing? Authoritarian. Training to handle bears? An insult to our intelligence. Bear storage? Nanny state intrusion.
Cable news would perpetually defer to bear wrangling experts, perpetually annoyed about the media getting details about claws and fur incorrect.
Meanwhile, bears would be attacking people. Because that’s what happens when inexperience confronts wild animals.
I thought about this as I was reading the latest butcher bill from Alabama’s guns-for-everyone approach to public safety. A Johns Hopkins University study released last month found the state in 2023 had a gun suicide death rate of 12.1 per 100,000 residents.
That’s much higher than the national average (7.6 per 100,000) and bad even for the gun-choked South. Only Arkansas and Tennessee had worse numbers.
This is what happens in a state with a lot of guns, a lot of despair and comparatively little access to mental health care.
Improving that system would be great, and improve the well-being of anyone in a crisis, whether life-threatening or otherwise. But a fully-funded, fully accessible mental health care network would still struggle to contain the damage from a society deluged with firearms. In a city where everyone carries lighters and oily rags, you can’t expect a fire department to prevent an inferno.
The Johns Hopkins report has good solutions, even transparently obvious ones: laws requiring gun owners to safely store their weapons; gun licenses as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, and laws allowing the confiscation of the weapons of people who may be a danger to themselves and others.
In the past, these proposals have died quick deaths in the Alabama Legislature. Republican lawmakers never want to face attacks from the right on gun access. So we have little oversight of firearms, a policy only a party extremist could love.
And maybe – maybe – legislators are starting to see the issues with that. The Legislature this year voted to make possession of Glock switches, which can turn handguns into automatic weapons, a state crime. It’s already a federal crime, but the hope is that the new law will make it easier to get these devices off the streets.
Lawmakers also passed a bill that will allow people to voluntarily surrender their firearms to a licensed arms dealer if they think they might be a threat to themselves or their loved ones. It’s a step, though not one that would save as many lives as allowing family members to ask a judge to do that.
But safe storage laws, about as common-sense an approach as you can get in a state that claims to love common sense, have struggled to get anywhere in this Legislature. And gun licenses? We all but abolished those for concealed carry in 2022.
Roughly half of Alabamians own guns. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to own them, particularly rifles for hunting.
But many Alabamians have a terrible idea that a gun is the only thing that will ensure our safety. A lot of people here marinate in a media environment that encourages fear and suspicion. One that suggests everyone has the ability to properly handle a firearm.
So we get hyped into believing that nothing must block the path to owning one. Not law; not personal responsibility; not concern for the safety of others.
This is madness. And it’s hard to tell how any of this is different from letting people run wild with bears. Alabama has nation-leading rates of firearm suicide and homicide, all in the name of “freedom.”
And what freedom is that? The freedom to fire a gun into a world that frightens you.

West is scheduled to be executed in September. (Alabama Department of Corrections)Gov. Kay Ivey last week set an execution date for Geoffrey Todd West, who was sentenced to death for the murder of Margaret Parrish Berry in March 1997.
West, 50, is scheduled to be put to death by nitrogen gas between midnight on Sept. 25 starting at midnight and 6 a.m. on Sept. 26 at 6 a.m. The announcement came less than a week after Ivey scheduled the execution of David Lee Roberts for August by the same method of execution.
A jury convicted West of capital murder in 1999.
According to court documents, West and his girlfriend on March 28, 1997 entered an Etowah County convenience store where West previously worked with the intention of robbing it.
He entered the store with a firearm and held a gun close to Berry while taking $250 during the robbery.
“The medical evidence indicates that Berry was shot in the back of the head while lying prone on the floor behind the counter of the store,” court documents state. “According to the medical examiner, the ‘wound would cause rapid incapacitation and a very rapid death.’”
West would be the fifth person that Alabama put to death this year. Demetrius Terrence Frazier was executed in February using nitrogen gas. The state put James Osgood to death in April by lethal injection and executed Gregory Hunt in June with nitrogen gas.

Amid all the worries about the perennially elusive youth vote, there’s a promising trend to talk about: In a growing number of towns and cities across the U.S., 16- and 17-year-olds are gaining the right to vote. The numbers are still small, but the momentum is real. Advocates say it’s about nurturing lifelong voters.
Take Newark, New Jersey, which allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in its school board election in April. Teen turnout was only about 3%. But that was better than the adults managed. Besides, as Sam Novey from the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement puts it, the city “started from nothing.”
Indeed, adding younger teens to the voter rolls involves building a lot of things from scratch. After Newark passed its ordinance last year allowing youth voting, officials had to rewire voter registration systems and launch a full-scale education campaign. It was about 14 months before 16- and 17-year-olds could cast their first ballots.
“Comparatively lightning fast,” Novey said.
And there’s a payoff to look forward to.
“Research shows that those who are allowed to register and begin voting at 16 are more likely to vote later in life than their peers,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky. “It’s an important way to increase participation.”
In short: Get ’em young, and they’ll keep coming back. The act of voting becomes normal, even expected. And school, Douglas said, is an ideal environment for that first civic nudge — with teachers and peers available to discuss the issues.
The research Douglas cited looked at Scotland, which allowed 16-year-olds to vote in its 2014 independence referendum. The decision was initially controversial, but “nothing bad happened,” said Jan Eichhorn, a political science professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies youth participation and cowrote the study. “Adults realized teenagers were paying attention, often more than adults.”
Public support for youth voting soared in Scotland after that.
The U.S. has been slower to move. Nationwide, the U.S. Constitution guarantees voting rights only for people 18 and older. But at the local level, things are heating up.
Right now, Maryland leads the way. Several municipalities there have already lowered the voting age for local races, taking advantage of state law that makes it easy for municipalities to accommodate registration and ballots for 16- and 17-year olds. A local council vote is enough to change quite a lot of election rules, including, for example, allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.
Compare that with Oakland, California, where voters approved youth voting back in 2020 — only to have to wait four full years for Alameda County to get around to updating its registration systems, a much longer delay than Newark.
In other words, even when the people say yes, the bureaucracy can say, “We’ll get to it eventually.”
That’s what Novey wants everyone to know: that lowering the voting age isn’t just a matter of changing policy. “It touches on a lot of different systems and issues,” he said. Some cities might be able to handle the transition in-house, but others may need new tech, new training, and a lot of patience and support.
In Newark, one of the biggest forces behind the policy was the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. Attorney Micauri Vargas, the associate counsel for the institute’s Democracy & Justice program who drafted the ordinance, said supporters “knew it wasn’t going to get done statewide,” despite Gov. Phil Murphy mentioning it in his last two State of the State speeches. So they went local, to the state’s largest city, where the mayor and City Council were supportive — and, notably, where the movement had been “started by the students.”
Not everyone was cheering. “People still just don’t feel comfortable with young people having a say in what they think are only money matters, but they aren’t,” Vargas said.
Even some teenagers were skeptical. “But then other young people would ask them if they trusted themselves, and they always said they did,” Vargas said. “They changed their minds.”
This question is about more than voting rules. It’s about trust — not just in systems, but in young people’s ability to shape them. And like Eichhorn said, some adults might just need to spend more time with teenagers to see what they’re capable of.
Of course, there are critics of expanding the franchise this way. Some argue that it’s a slippery slope, or that teenagers are too immature or uninformed to handle voting responsibly. But Douglas points out that we don’t typically take voting rights away from adults on that basis — “even ones who may be legally incompetent. Yet bright, informed 16-year-olds can’t vote.” Fair point.
For now, youth voting in America is a patchwork, enabled by quirks in local laws, driven by ambitious students, and supported by researchers like Novey and his Vote 16 Network, which offers best practices for cities.
And it’s still far from mainstream. But so was same-day registration once. So was voting by mail. So was early voting. All of those ideas sounded radical at some point — until they didn’t.

Wes Moore signing legislation. The governor vetoed 20 bills this year, perhaps none more controversial than his veto of a bill creating a commission to study reparations for descendants of enslaved Marylanders. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)In the arc of African American political and social history, leaders have often faced the difficult task of balancing immediate demands for justice with the pragmatic constraints of political and societal realities.
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s decision in 2025 to veto a bill that would have created a reparations commission offers a modern echo of Booker T. Washington’s famous Atlanta Compromise of 1895. Though separated by more than a century, both decisions represent strategic compromises made by Black leaders navigating predominantly white political environments. Each action provoked debate within the Black community over the pace and form of progress, raising enduring questions about the best path toward racial justice.
Booker T. Washington’s Atlanta Compromise speech, delivered in 1895, advocated for a philosophy of accommodation in the post-Reconstruction South. Rather than push for immediate civil rights or political equality, Washington urged African Americans to focus on vocational education and economic self-reliance, arguing that success in these areas would eventually lead to greater social equality.

His proposal was seen as a pragmatic adaptation to the harsh realities of the Jim Crow South, where direct challenges to white supremacy often provoked violent backlash. Washington’s stance won support from many white leaders and philanthropists, but it also sparked fierce criticism from Black intellectuals like W.E.B. Du Bois, who saw the compromise as capitulation and a betrayal of the struggle for full civil rights.
Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the reparations bill, similarly, was rooted in political calculation. Though Moore — a Black man, moderate and Rhodes scholar with a history on Wall Street — acknowledged the importance of addressing racial inequities, he argued that there have been enough studies done to explore reparations, and the time to act is now. But action without a coherent, community-informed plan risks superficiality, inefficacy or even harm.
Supporters of the bill saw it as a vital step toward truth-telling and economic justice for descendants of slavery and systemic racism in Maryland. Critics of Moore’s veto, much like Du Bois in Washington’s time, viewed his decision as a disappointing deferral of long-overdue justice. They argued that the governor, as a symbol of Black political ascendance, had a unique responsibility to champion reparations — regardless of political risk. What Maryland’s first Black governor reminds us is that representation does not easily translate into major policy changes.
What unites both Washington’s compromise and Moore’s veto is the strategic tension between symbolic gestures and material progress, between idealism and pragmatism.
Washington sought to avoid confrontation and appeal to white power brokers to secure economic uplift; Moore sought to preserve political capital and maintain broad legislative momentum. Both decisions can be interpreted as efforts to navigate hostile or resistant political terrains while avoiding moves that could stall broader progress. In both cases, however, this approach came at the cost of alienating parts of the Black community who view these decisions as moral failures to confront systemic injustice head-on.
Yet, while Washington operated in a time of almost total disenfranchisement for Black Americans, Moore functions within a democratic system that purports to be more progressive and inclusive — raising the stakes and expectations for a leader like him. The veto, for many, stings more deeply precisely because Moore, unlike Washington, holds real executive power in a state where Black political mobilization has shown tangible results.
Ultimately, both the Atlanta Compromise and Moore’s veto reflect the complex calculus required of Black leadership in America. They reveal the enduring struggle between compromise and confrontation, reform and revolution. As history continues to unfold, these decisions are likely to be reassessed not only by their immediate political effects but also by their place in the broader moral trajectory of racial justice in America.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0372-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-07 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The CT diesel fuel tax dropped this month. What you should know,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/07/ct-diesel-fuel-tax-dropped-what-to-know/,"Since most goods delivered to CT come by truck, changes in the diesel tax can impact the price of groceries, clothing, medications and more.","Connecticut’s tax on diesel fuel is unlike most other charges the state levies.
Legislators consistently tweak the state’s largest revenue engines — the income, sales and corporation taxes — revising credits, closing or adding exemptions, or revising rates every few years.
The retail gasoline tax, one of the chief drivers of Connecticut’s transportation program, isn’t the product of any special calculations, but rather a flat, 25 cents per gallon.
The diesel tax, though, has largely been on autopilot for almost two decades, following a formula and updating itself automatically every July 1. This year, that formula ended up producing a drop in the tax of 3.5 cents per gallon, which went into effect last week.
And given that the overwhelming bulk of goods delivered to Connecticut come by trucks, which chiefly rely on diesel fuel, changes in that tax can impact the prices of groceries, clothing, medications and a wide variety of other items.
Here’s what to know about the state’s diesel tax and the impact of this year’s decrease.
How is the diesel tax calculated?
Asked by the trucking industry and others to keep diesel taxes close to those state levies related to regular gasoline, the 2007 General Assembly enacted a three-step formula.
First, state officials would look back over the prior year and determine the average wholesale price of diesel fuel in Connecticut.
Second, they would multiply that average price by 8.81%, which is the effective wholesale rate that’s applied to gasoline when it is delivered to local filling stations and convenience stores.
Third, they would add a flat amount, which is 29 cents per gallon.
The formula would be applied each summer with an updated diesel tax rate taking effect on July 1.
This is not identical, but like Connecticut’s system for taxing regular gasoline. Besides the wholesale levy that’s added to the price when fuel is delivered to the station, the state adds a retail tax — a flat, 25-cents-per-gallon — when motorists purchase the gas.
How has the diesel tax changed over the last few years?
Despite those steps, the diesel tax doesn’t always work out the way state legislators or the governor likes — although this year it did.
The Department of Revenue Services announced recently that, effective July 1, the formula had reduced the levy by 3.5 cents per gallon, from 52.4 cents to 48.9 cents.
“This tax cut comes at a critical time when the economy is facing much uncertainty between conflict in the Middle East that could affect oil prices and the [federal] administration’s on-again-off-again trade wars,” said Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Transportation Committee. “This decrease will provide some relief on operating costs for businesses, the trucking industry in particular, and I am hopeful that relief will be shared with consumers.”
About 90% of the freight — both in terms of tonnage and dollar value — moved across Connecticut in 2019 traveled via truck, according to the 2022 update to the Department of Transportation’s Statewide Freight Plan. The remainder was carried chiefly by rail.
But three Republican state senators recently urged consumers to remember their history.
Since July 2021, when the formula produced a tax of 40.1 cents per gallon, the levy, overall, has grown by 8.8 cents.
Minority Republicans proposed suspending the entire diesel tax in the summer of 2022, when surging fuel prices produced a 9-cents-per-gallon increase in the levy — even as inflation took a historic bite out of consumers’ wallets.
The Consumer Price Index increased 9.1% in June 2022, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the single-largest increase in 40 years.
And the diesel tax would have jumped another 12 cents per gallon in July 2023, but Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature ordered a one-time suspension of the formula.
Is the formula accepted or have there been calls to change it?
The GOP has argued for a reduction of the diesel levy and to eliminate a highway mileage tax on large, non-dairy, commercial trucks.
“That would support local businesses, create jobs, and provide real relief for everyone in Connecticut,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Republican Sens. Jeff Gordon of Woodstock and Henri Martin of Bristol wrote in a joint statement in late June.
The diesel tax supports roughly 6% of the state budget’s Special Transportation Fund, or STF, which gets most of its resources from Connecticut’s sales tax and from levies on regular gasoline.
It generated $134 million in the 2023-24 fiscal year — the last full year of data available from state tax officials. 
Connecticut has generated large STF surpluses in recent years, some exceeding 10%, though legislators and Lamont have committed to use much of those windfalls to accelerating paying down bonded debt on highway, bridge and rail construction projects.
The Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, which represents fuel distributors across the state, has pushed in recent years for the state to replace the formula-based diesel tax with a flat, per-gallon charge.
“Stability in the tax makes the most sense,” said Chris Herb, CEMA’s president and CEO. “If the taxes aren’t bouncing around, it becomes a little easier to sell the fuel.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_9178.jpg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sean Montague: Our independent schools are more than just educational institutions, they are social and economic cornerstones.","This commentary is by Sean Montague of West Burke. He is a remote federal employee with the Smithsonian Institution and parent of two — one attending St. Johnsbury Academy and another soon to enroll. 


Gov. Phil Scott recently signed H.454, legislation with profound implications for independent schools, particularly here in the Northeast Kingdom. Institutions like St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndon Institute aren’t merely schools — they are fundamental economic engines sustaining our local communities.
It’s clear to me that many people from Vermont’s population centers to the west don’t fully grasp how deeply intertwined these academies are with the economic vitality and demographic stability of our region.
St. Johnsbury Academy, for instance, is more than an educational institution; it’s a magnet attracting young families and professionals who contribute significantly to our local economy. Vermont faces well-documented demographic challenges, with an aging population and difficulty attracting younger residents. The Academy’s appeal counters these trends, bolstering our communities with newcomers who bring energy, skills, and economic resources.

Moreover, these academies offer invaluable educational opportunities to socially disadvantaged students who otherwise might never have access to such high-quality education, typically available only to higher-income families. While recognizing that other regions of Vermont may not have this option, it remains crucial to acknowledge the transformative impact these institutions have on the lives of many students in our community.
Anecdotally, many families I know have openly stated they would consider leaving Vermont if their children could no longer attend St. Johnsbury Academy. The ripple effect would be devastating — not just academically, but economically — leading to fewer local businesses, declining property values, and diminished regional vibrancy.
Furthermore, our state senator faces unfair criticism alleging a conflict of interest due to his employment at St. Johnsbury Academy. Yet he was elected precisely to represent and advocate for the economic well-being of the Northeast Kingdom.
The Academy isn’t a private interest — it’s the cornerstone of our economic and social fabric. His support of it aligns entirely with the interests of the constituents who elected him.
This issue starkly highlights the disconnect between the more urban and liberal centers of central and western Vermont and our predominantly rural and conservative communities.
While I consider myself politically liberal, if there is one thing liberals and conservatives in this part of Vermont can agree on, it’s this: we deserve policies and legislation informed by genuine understanding and respect for our unique circumstances, not assumptions made from afar.

A few short years ago I reached out to VTDigger about a fledgling research project I was leading. We needed volunteers in Vermont to submit observations of rain and snow so we could help NASA better track and simulate precipitation type during winter storms in mountain regions across the U.S.
Readers responded to Emma Cotton’s article enthusiastically. Nearly 300 new Vermont volunteers signed up just after its publication.
I am now writing to VTDigger readers not to report on our findings or share new opportunities, but to warn of the risks coming to the US scientific enterprise from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” just passed by the Senate. The administration is proposing to shutter the very program that funded our work in Vermont, NASA’s Citizen Science for Earth Systems Program.

While NASA may evoke images of spaceflight, galaxy-defining telescopes, and interstellar satellite missions, the agency also has a critical Earth-observation mandate. Its constellation of satellites crisscrosses the globe every day, monitoring important properties like rainfall, soil wetness, river height, land surface temperature, and others.
Underpinning these observations are the unreplaceable measurements of Earth system phenomena, many made by CSESP volunteers, that evaluate and improve the process of data collection, simulation, and synthesis.
Our project, Mountain Rain or Snow, is a prime example. The differences between rain and snow are obvious to a real human observer, but satellites and computer models often struggle to differentiate the two. This shortcoming worsens our ability to predict floods, manage roadway conditions, and estimate avalanche risks.
In peer-reviewed literature, the scientific gold standard, our team has shown time and again that there is no replacement for visual observers. Not even artificial intelligence can do the jobs that humans do.
We are at the precipice of losing this ability to understand our planet. Without CSESP funding, projects like Mountain Rain or Snow, to which Vermonters have volunteered countless hours, will no longer exist.
And it’s not just our team at risk. CSESP projects have examined river ice dynamics for transportation and flooding in Alaska, water quality in Chesapeake Bay, and lake levels across the globe. Work like this is on the verge of disappearing.
Every Vermonter knows that despair is the cousin to apathy. So don’t think of this as a eulogy for U.S. scientific research, but instead treat it as a call to action, a rallying point for continued American scientific excellence.
Talk to your friends, reach out to colleagues in Republican congressional districts, protest the unnecessary kneecapping of U.S.-funded research, and make your opinions known.

Both lawmakers represent the 32nd Legislative District, which covers part of Seattle and surrounding areas. (Photos courtesy of Washington State Legislature)Two Democratic state lawmakers are set to clash in 2026 in one of the party’s strongholds in western Washington.
State Rep. Cindy Ryu has launched a campaign to unseat Sen. Jesse Salomon, saying the colleague she once endorsed is “too moderate” for their district, which straddles the border of King and Snohomish counties.
“He’s my senator. If you don’t like somebody as your elected official, what do you do? You try to get them out of office,” she said.
Salomon, who is seeking a third term, said he’s proud to be a “pragmatic progressive.” He did not criticize the liberal Ryu, though it’s no secret under the dome that the two do not get along.
“I have been an effective voice for my district, and due to my pragmatic approach, have made real progress on affordable housing, public safety, and behavioral health,” he said in an email.
Salomon said he has not asked donors to “refrain” from giving to Ryu’s campaign. His focus is getting the word out that he enjoys the backing of the Senate Democratic Caucus and the third member of the legislative district’s delegation, Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Seattle.
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, is very displeased by the brewing intra-party battle.
“It is a distraction,” he said. “Our caucus is a team. We support our members. I do not welcome people deciding to run against and divert resources to run against members in safe districts and in good standing.”
Pedersen has tried to choke off a potential source of funds for Ryu – unspent contributions to her 2024 House race that are now in a surplus account. To transfer any of those donations to her Senate bid, Ryu must first get the donor’s permission.
“As you consider this request,” Pedersen wrote in a June 27 email to Democratic donors obtained by The Standard, “please know that we will view any surplus transfer as a direct contribution to Rep. Ryu’s campaign. Our strong preference is that resources be directed toward supporting our campaign committee and members in competitive races.”
Setting the stage
This looming duel is in the 32nd Legislative District, which includes northwest Seattle, Shoreline, Edmonds, Woodway, Mountlake Terrace, and Lynnwood.
It is a safe district for Democrats. In 2024, Ryu and Davis were each re-elected with more than 74% of the vote. Salomon received nearly 75% when he won a second term in 2022.
Both Ryu and Salomon arrived in Olympia following stints on the Shoreline City Council.
Ryu, who immigrated to Washington from Korea in 1969, spent four years on the council before winning her House seat in 2010. She has been re-elected seven times. If she is unsuccessful next year, she will be out of legislative office.
She chairs the House Technology, Economic Development, and Veterans Committee and serves on the Appropriations and the Consumer Protection and Business panels.
Salomon served seven years on the city council before he got elected in 2018 by unseating the incumbent Democratic senator, Maralyn Chase. Salomon was re-elected in 2022. In 2006, while living in Whatcom County, Salomon ran for state Senate in the 42nd District and lost to the incumbent, Republican Dale Brandland.
He chairs the Senate Local Government Committee and serves on the Housing, Law and Justice, and Rules committees.
Ryu said she told Pedersen over a year ago that she might mount a challenge because she didn’t feel Salomon was “pulling in the same direction” as she and Davis. Ryu also criticized the senator for not engaging with the representatives enough on events in the district.
Policywise, Ryu said his vote to raise the state’s limit on rent increases to 10% plus inflation in a single year — up from the 7% cap that she and a majority of House Democrats had approved — helped cement her decision.
“Why couldn’t he pass the 7 percent?,” she said.
“I am always concerned about unintended consequences,” Salomon said. I gather input from a variety of people and reach out to experts to ensure that we’re not going to throw things off track.”

It began as an evening of celebration on May 18, 2024, but devolved into melee when wedding guest Jonathan Goff and his wife began arguing in the parking lot over whether Goff’s wife had been flirting with another wedding guest.
The groom later told police “everybody knew” he kept a handgun in his car’s center console. So, when an angry, intoxicated Goff bolted for Parker’s car, Parker followed and the two struggled for the gun. Patrick McIntosh tried to intervene but was wounded in the hand as the gun went off. He spent the night in the hospital.
Gun violence in rural America seldom receives the media attention of shootings in larger urban areas. But the problem in rural towns like Salem is more prevalent — and growing faster — than many people realize, gun control advocates say. 
“There’s this myth that all gun violence is in big urban cities and it’s just suicides in rural areas and homicides in cities,” said Nick Wilson, senior director of the gun violence prevention program at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy institute in Washington, D.C. “We wanted to see if that assumption was true.”
Compiling Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2016 to 2020, the think tank found that 13 of the 20 U.S. counties with the most gun homicides per capita were in rural areas. 
Of those 20 counties, 80% were in states that received an “F” grade for their weak gun laws in the 2021 annual state scorecard from Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For all gun deaths — homicides, suicides and accidents — the rate in rural communities was 40% higher than it was for metropolitan areas. The study defined as rural any county with fewer than 50,000 people.
Southern Indiana statistics
Several rural counties in southern Indiana have surprisingly high rates of gun homicides. 
Based on CDC statistics compiled by Giffords from 1999 to 2023, Washington County ranked 23rd in the state for gun homicides while placing 57th in population among all 92 counties. More dramatic were findings in Scott County, which was ninth in gun homicides but 62nd in population, and Owen County, which ranked 13th in gun homicides and 68th for population.
After a year of permitless carry in Indiana, handgun licenses and related misdemeanors drop

Rural counties in every state traditionally have a higher rate of gun suicides than larger metropolitan counties. In Indiana, the top five counties for gun suicide rates are all rural – with Washington County ranked highest followed, in order, by Crawford, Brown, Jennings and Scott counties.
Given the tradition of hunting and shooting in rural areas, “we see more people carrying their guns out and about,” Wilson said. “Then they get into an argument, they get road rage, they get in a minor dispute that might have been just people shouting or maybe a fistfight before. Now with so many people carrying guns, they can escalate to shootings. And as more people carry their guns with them, they leave them in their car.”
Adding to the problem is “the loosening of concealed carry laws” in states like Indiana, he said.
Indiana received a D- rating from Giffords for its weak gun laws. The state has no universal background checks, no gun owner licensing, no restrictions on assault weapons, no ban on large capacity magazines, no waiting period to purchase firearms, no permits for carrying concealed handguns, no funding for community violence intervention, and only a few laws addressing the problem of guns and domestic violence.
Indiana’s lawmakers also declined to pass a safe storage bill in 2024 that would have imposed criminal penalties on gun owners who failed to secure firearms used by children to injure or kill.
Pushback
Gun rights advocates, however, say the real blame is the failure of states like Indiana to address the underlying issues of mental health and crime. 
“The Giffords organization takes an amalgamation of data from a few very serious public health issues, and they label it all as gun violence,” said Charlie Hiltunen, president of the Indiana Rifle and Pistol Association and a board member of the National Rifle Association. 
“Unfortunately, it distracts from the underlying problems” associated with homicide and suicide, he said, including the lack of mental health services and especially in rural areas.
  Charlie Hiltunen
Scott County Sheriff Jerry Goodin called the CDC data “not accurate to us because it appears to use gun deaths no matter what kind.” 
The CDC’s homicide data reflects the intentional taking of a life with a gun by another person, including victims killed in cases of self-defense. 
The agency’s tally includes cases like the 2024 death of Scottsburg resident Edward Calton, 49, who was shot by his brother during a fight in their mother’s apartment, as well as the 2023 death of Michael Chastain, 45, who was shot by his ex-girlfriend’s mother as Chastain held the father at gunpoint in the front yard of their home. Both cases were considered self-defense and the shooters weren’t charged.
“I’m not saying that people shouldn’t have firearms or that we should take guns away from people,” said Beth Keeney, chief executive of LifeSpring Health Systems, the state-appointed nonprofit offering medical and behavioral services at 27 facilities in southern Indiana. “But we should absolutely try to limit access to them when we know that people are experiencing behavioral health crises or concerns.” 
Keeney added that “families can do that through their local law enforcement using the Red Flag provisions and statute.” 
In 2005, Indiana became one of the earliest states to enact a Red Flag law that allows local courts to temporarily suspend a person’s access to firearms if they demonstrate significant risk of violence to others or self-harm. 
In reality, however, rural counties seldom issue such protective orders. 
In 2023 and 2024, court records show that Washington County didn’t issue a single Red Flag order and Scott County issued just one in each of those years. By comparison, Marion County recorded 82 in 2023 and 145 in 2024.
Residents of rural communities often don’t give mental health issues the serious consideration they deserve, said Jessica Staley, a LifeSpring employee and Floyd County volunteer for the Indiana LOSS Team, a support group for those who have lost loved ones to suicide.
“Farming communities have always had the reputation of (thinking) ‘we’re strong, we take care of our own and we keep it in-house,’” Staley said. “Nobody really talks about (suicide) in those families.”
When rural residents do talk about people with mental health problems, it’s not with any urgency, she said. “It’s like, ‘You know, there’s just something wrong with so and so.’ But nobody ever talks about it other than gossiping.”
Hiltunen of the NRA pointed out that the Indiana Legislature continues to underfund mental health services, especially in rural areas. The state budget provides only $50 million of the $130 million that the Behavioral Health Commission says is needed each year to adequately serve the mental health needs of Hoosiers.

Lifespring offers walk-in behavioral services at all 27 of its facilities. Anyone with concerns can also call 833-SAFE-988 to access support at any time.

Staley agreed that mental health services are lacking in many rural communities in Indiana, “but LifeSpring is working to change that.” The group offers walk-in behavioral services at all 27 of its facilities. Anyone with concerns can also call 833-SAFE-988 to access support at any time.
Staley, 44, is familiar with mental health issues from her own family. For 15 years, she took care of her bipolar and schizophrenic mother until she died in 2022. 
That same year, her older brother Aaron, who was struggling with addiction, died from an intentional overdose at age 53. 
“His mother, my stepmother, had passed away a couple years before, and that devastated him mentally,” she said. “He himself was kind of a good old boy. And they don’t talk about mental health — that’s for, you know, sissies and pansies.” 
Staley urges every rural resident to overcome the stigma of seeking behavioral help and not wait until it’s too late. 
“It’s okay to not be okay. That’s such a huge thing that we all have to give ourselves,” she said. 
And that goes for anyone else we see in mental anguish, she said: “Don’t hesitate to tell them, ‘You might want to talk to someone. Have you thought about it?’”

(Getty Images)There is so much happening in the world today, and I find myself asking, “Have we learned nothing from history?” American journalist Norman Cousins once said, “History is a vast early warning system.” Right now, we need to heed that warning system. 
Current conversations and actions around Medicaid are deeply concerning. We must remember our history and the hard-earned lessons that came with it.
States across the country, including Indiana, are facing significant cuts to Medicaid funding and increasingly strict eligibility rules. Indiana has already begun reducing costs by limiting services and tightening who qualifies. Even harder decisions will be made in the coming months as we fully understand the ramifications of the federal budget bill.  
Some policymakers have already stated that it could be less expensive to serve people in large congregate settings, institutions, rather than providing services in their family home or small residential settings. 
This is not only flawed thinking; it’s dangerous.
Indiana once led the nation in opening institutions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), but we also led the nation in closing them. We should take pride in that history of progress, not abandon it.
Indiana’s history of institutionalization

1890 – Asylum for Feeble Minded Children, one of the first institutions in the nation for the “Feeble Minded,” opened in Fort Wayne.  
1907 – Indiana Village for Epileptics, one of the first facilities in the world designed specifically for people with epilepsy, opened in New Castle. 
1920 – Indiana Farm Colony for the Feeble Minded opened near Butlerville. 

The “Feeble Minded” were later classified as idiots, imbeciles, and morons. The more “progressive” terms of low, mild or high functioning mental retardation followed. By 1997, when Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a law requiring “people first” language in Indiana code, along with eliminating the use of the “R” word, the term “intellectual and developmental disabilities” (IDD) was widely in use. 

1943 – Northern Indiana Children’s Hospital opens in South Bend to care for children with polio. It later became an institution for children with IDD. 
1974 – Silvercrest Children’s Developmental Center opened in New Albany.  

In addition to warehousing people, often under terrible and dehumanizing conditions,  Indiana led the world in enacting a law in 1907 authorizing the involuntary sterilization of institutionalized people, including “idiots and imbeciles,” based on eugenics principles. Approximately 2,500 Hoosiers were sterilized under this and subsequent laws before the practice was repealed in 1974.
Expansion of home and community-based services
In 1997, a hidden camera investigation by WISH-TV exposed abuse at New Castle State Developmental Center. That began the process to close all of Indiana’s state institutions for people with IDD between 1998 and 2007. Fort Wayne State Developmental Center was the last to close, 117 years after it opened. Both Democratic and Republican governors believed investing in home and community-based services was the right thing to do and continued to close Indiana’s institutions. 
The establishment of the Medicaid Waiver Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) program under President Ronald Reagan in 1981 allowed for the growth of HCBS services. Indiana’s program began in 1990. This bipartisan effort, from Govs. Frank O’Bannon to Daniels, was powered by a shared belief that people deserve to live with dignity in their communities.   
Medicaid Waivers “waive” the requirement that a person live in a Medicaid-funded institution if the cost is less to support them in the community. When Indiana’s last Medicaid-funded institution closed in 2007, the yearly cost per person was $233,600. Adjusted for inflation, this would now be over $350,000 per person per year (Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator).
Investing in HCBS is not only cost-effective, it is the morally right thing to do.
We cannot let history repeat itself
Think about the thousands of Hoosiers with IDD who are now living meaningful lives in their communities — going to work, spending time with their families and friends, and being part of society. Imagine telling them they must return to prison-like institutions because the state wants to save money.
And what about future generations? Children will continue to be born with significant disabilities. Do we want to return to a time when doctors told parents, “Put your child in an institution and try to forget about them?”
We’ve come too far to turn back.
Let us honor our history, not repeat its darkest chapters. The choices we make today will determine whether we continue to build a more inclusive and compassionate society or retreat into one we should never revisit.

Michigan’s top education leader is urging the Trump administration to release nearly $7 billion in funding the federal government is withholding from schools nationwide.
In Michigan, that includes nearly $160 million.
The funding, approved by Congress earlier this year as part of a continuing budget resolution signed by President Donald Trump in March, was supposed to be distributed Tuesday. But the Trump administration said Monday it would not release the funds, Chalkbeat reported.
“These federal dollars support some of our most economically disadvantaged and vulnerable students,” Michigan State Superintendent Michael Rice said in a statement Wednesday. “The U.S. Department of Education should provide the approved funding immediately.”
The money funds programs that support migrant education ($5.4 million), services for English learners ($12.8 million), staff professional development ($63.7 million), before- and after-school programs ($36.7 million), and academic enrichment ($38.3 million), Rice said.
Rice said that based on past practice, “local school districts were rightly counting on this approved funding by July 1.”
He said the Michigan Department of Education, which he oversees, “is working with colleagues across the country and with legal counsel to reflect upon the adverse impact to students, staff, and schools of this withholding.”
It was unclear Wednesday afternoon if the department is considering legal action.
A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Wednesday that the move to withhold the funding was part of an ongoing programmatic review of education funding, and that no decisions had been made yet.
Initial findings, the spokesperson said, “have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

The tax and spending legislation President Donald Trump signed Friday, enacting much of his domestic agenda, cuts federal health spending by about $1 trillion over a decade in ways that will jeopardize the physical and financial health of tens of millions of Americans.
The bill, passed in both the House and the Senate without a single Democratic vote, is expected to reverse many of the health coverage gains of the Biden and Obama administrations. Their policies made it easier for millions of people to access health care and reduced the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows, though Republicans say the trade-off was far higher costs borne by taxpayers and increased fraud.
Under the legislation, reductions in federal support for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause nearly 12 million more people to be without insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That in turn is expected to undermine the finances of hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers — which will have to absorb more of the cost of treating uninsured people. Some may reduce services and employees or close altogether.
Here are five ways the GOP’s plans may affect health care access.
Need Medicaid? Then get a job
The deepest cuts to health care spending come from a proposed Medicaid work requirement, which is expected to end coverage for millions of enrollees who do not meet new employment or reporting standards.
In 40 states and Washington, D.C., all of which have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child. The new requirement will start as early as January 2027.
The bill’s requirement doesn’t apply to people in the 10 largely GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to nondisabled adults.
Health researchers say the policy will have little impact on employment. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees who don’t receive disability benefits already work or are looking for work, or are unable to do so because they have a disability, attend school, or care for a family member, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
State experiments with work requirements have been plagued with administrative issues, such as eligible enrollees’ losing coverage over paperwork problems, and budget overruns. Georgia’s work requirement, which officially launched in July 2023, has cost more than $90 million, with only $26 million of that spent on health benefits, according to the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization.
“The hidden costs are astronomical,” said Chima Ndumele, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
Less cash means less care in rural communities
Belt-tightening that targets states could translate into fewer health services, medical professionals, and even hospitals, especially in rural communities.
The GOP’s plan curtails a practice, known as provider taxes, that nearly every state has used for decades to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers and to private managed-care companies.
States often use the federal money generated through the taxes to pay the institutions more than Medicaid would otherwise pay. Medicaid generally pays lower fees for care than Medicare, the program for people over 65 and some with disabilities, and private insurance. But thanks to provider taxes, some hospitals are paid more under Medicaid than Medicare, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit.
Hospitals and nursing homes say they use these extra Medicaid dollars to expand or add new services and improve care for all patients.
Rural hospitals typically operate on thin profit margins and rely on payments from Medicaid taxes to sustain them. Researchers from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research who examined the original House version of the bill concluded it would push more than 300 rural hospitals — many of them in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma — toward service reductions or closure.
Republicans in the Senate tacked a $50 billion fund onto the legislation to cushion the blow to rural hospitals. The money will be distributed starting in 2027 and continue for five years.
Harder to get, and keep, ACA coverage
For those with Obamacare plans, the new legislation will make it harder to enroll and to retain their coverage.
ACA marketplace policyholders will be required to update their income, immigration status, and other information each year, rather than be allowed to automatically reenroll — something more than 10 million people did this year. They’ll also have less time to enroll; the bill shortens the annual open enrollment period by about a month.
People applying for coverage outside that period — for instance because they lose a job or other insurance or need to add a newborn or spouse to an existing policy — will have to wait for all their documents to be processed before receiving government subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Today, they get up to 90 days of premium help during the application process, which can take weeks.
Republican lawmakers and some conservative policy think tanks, including the Paragon Health Institute, say the changes are needed to reduce fraudulent enrollments, while opponents say they represent Trump’s best effort to undo Obamacare.
The legislation also does not call for an extension of more generous premium subsidies put in place during the covid pandemic. If Congress doesn’t act, those enhanced subsidies will expire at year’s end, resulting in premiums rising by an average of 75% next year, according to KFF.
On Medicaid? Pay more to see doctors
Many Medicaid enrollees can expect to pay more out-of-pocket for appointments.
Trump’s legislation requires states that have expanded Medicaid to charge enrollees up to $35 for some services if their incomes are between the federal poverty level (this year, $15,650 for an individual) and 138% of that amount ($21,597).
Medicaid enrollees often don’t pay anything when seeking medical services because studies have shown charging even small copayments prompts low-income people to forgo needed care. In recent years, some states have added charges under $10 for certain services.
The policy won’t apply to people seeking primary care, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. The bill allows states to enact even higher cost sharing for enrollees who seek emergency room care for nonemergencies. But if Medicaid patients fail to pay, hospitals and other providers could be left to foot the bill.
Cuts to lawfully present immigrants
The GOP plan could cause at least hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are lawfully present — including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking, and refugees — to lose their ACA marketplace coverage by cutting off the subsidies that make premiums affordable. The restriction won’t apply to green-card holders.
Because the immigrants who will lose subsidies under the legislation tend to be younger than the overall U.S. population, their exit would leave an older, sicker, and costlier population of marketplace enrollees, further pushing up marketplace premiums, according to marketplace directors in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and health analysts.
Taking health care access away from immigrants living in the country legally “will do irreparable harm to individuals we have promised to protect and impose unnecessary costs on local systems already under strain,” John Slocum, executive director of Refugee Council USA, an advocacy group, said in a statement.
The bill reflects the Trump administration’s restrictive approach to immigration. But because it ran afoul of Senate rules, the legislation doesn’t include a proposal that would have reduced federal Medicaid payments to states such as California that use their own money to cover immigrants without legal status.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)If you’re wondering what happens when history is bowdlerized or suppressed, lies are enshrined, free enquiry stifled, empathy ridiculed, education crippled, and hatred valorized, take a look at Preston Damsky, racist, antisemite, and top law student at the University of Florida.
Damsky’s now notorious for receiving a “book award” as the best student in his “Originalism” seminar. Seems the professors were dazzled by his capstone essay arguing the Constitution’s “We the People” means white people.
Only white people.
Non-whites should have their voting rights protections removed. What he calls “criminal infiltrators at the border” should be shot on sight.
Amendments 13, 14, and 15, the ones abolishing slavery and enshrining citizenship, equal treatment under the law, and the right to vote are illegitimate.
According to Damsky, “The United States was founded as a race-based nation-state for the preservation and betterment of White Americans (the People), as clearly laid out in the Preamble and revealed by our history, it is difficult to see how these amendments (or at least the way they have been interpreted in the post-World War II era) do not amount to unconstitutional, revolutionary usurpations by the constituted government power.”
There’s a touch of truth in this: The 18th Century iteration of our Constitution was indeed written by white men for white men.
But much as he’d love for American society to look like it did in 1788, when the Federalist Papers were published, times have changed. We fought a bitter war over slavery, marched against segregation, demanded rights for the disenfranchised, and eventually legislated our way — slowly and partially — to a more equitable nation.
The post-Civil War amendments are just as valid, just as much a part of the Constitution of the United States, as the earlier ones.
For now, at least: it’s unclear whether this will continue to be the case.
 At home in Florida
Most Americans once celebrated our heterogeneity, our pluralism, and our tendency to expand freedoms. We valued knowledge and tried to foster understanding; we welcomed the new.
Not so much these days, not here in Florida. Trump and DeSantis have made ignorance great again.
This state now has statutes forbidding teaching the truth about slavery and Jim Crow, threatening educators who discuss gender, sexuality, systemic racism, and other disfavored topics.
Universities are scrubbing their websites of words that might upset the governor and his goons: “women,” “Black,” “colonialism,” and “diversity” — even if it’s “biodiversity” — anything seen as threatening to white, male Christian hegemony.
No wonder Preston Damsky, who was raised in the alarmingly multicultural world of Southern California, feels at home in here in Florida.
Florida is also alarmingly multicultural, of course, but our governor — while not an avowed white supremacist — is nonetheless an anti-immigrant, anti-civil rights, Viktor Orban-wannabe whose definition of “American” leaves out an awful lot of people.
DeSantis’ Florida is big on book bans, removing from schools books with LGBTQ characters, books about civil rights, books questioning American exceptionalism, books that tell painful truths about the world.
Toni Morrison’s “Bluest Eye,” Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse Five,” William Styron’s “Sophie’s Choice,” Khaled Hosseini’s “Kite Runner,” Margaret Atwood’s “Handmaid’s Tale,” Judy Blume’s “Forever,” and Anne Frank’s “Diary” have all been challenged or deep-sixed by parents and school boards who want to suppress stories that might deepen and complicate students’ knowledge of the country they live in or expand their understanding of ways to be human.
In Escambia County, they’ve yanked the dictionary off the shelf.
Seems Merriam-Webster might harbor smut and subversion.
 ‘Institutional neutrality’
But nobody’s censoring Preston Damsky’s weird, warped take on who counts as a real American, and nobody is punishing him for being a white supremacist.
When asked why Damsky’s paper was not only acceptable but worthy of an award, the interim dean of UF’s law school cited “institutional neutrality” and said professors must not practice “viewpoint discrimination.”
This is actually as it should be: Contrary to right-wing talking points accusing the academy of “canceling” the insufficiently “woke,” universities are places where you can express unpopular, even vile, racist, exceptionally stupid opinions.
But “institutional neutrality” doesn’t seem to apply to all exceptionally stupid opinions — as Preston Damsky has now discovered.
Virulent racism is OK: The Trump regime is not yanking funding from universities for anti-Black discrimination.
Antisemitism, however, unleashes a firestorm.
The Trump-DeSantis axis has ginned up such hysteria over perceived antisemitism (which the rational among us can see is often principled support for the Palestinian people and horror at the murderous Netanyahu government), that anyone who criticizes Israel is treated like Heinrich Himmler, architect of the “Final Solution.”
Mohsen Madawi, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mahmoud Khalil and other student protesters detained for exercising their First Amendment rights are not Nazis. Preston Damsky, on the other hand … well, he has said calling him a Nazi “would not be manifestly wrong.”
His social media posts call Jews “parasites” and declare they must be “abolished by any means necessary.”
In a neat triangulation of white nationalism, antisemitic paranoia, and (somewhat understandable) disdain for the whole U.S. government, one of Damsky’s X posts castigates Donald Trump for inviting rapper (and Florida native) Kodak Black to the White House.
This, Damsky said, serves to “normalize and glorify the mongrelized stupidity that is modern Jewish-produced ‘popular’ ‘culture.’”
 ‘Warrior culture’
You’d think the guy would notice Trump is not exactly devoid of his own antisemitism, accusing Jews of being money-grubbing and “disloyal” to America. In Iowa the other day, he invoked one of the oldest and nastiest Jewish stereotypes, calling bankers “shylocks.”
And surely Damsky would give the Trumpists credit for their own racist projects, restoring Confederate names to military facilities and starting the process to take Harriet Tubman’s name off a Navy ship.
Defense Secretary “Good Hair” Hegseth bleats about restoring a “warrior culture” to the military, obviously unaware that Harriet Tubman spied for the Union Army and led the 1863 Combahee Ferry Raid into Confederate territory.
Look it up, Pete. She was a warrior.
UF hasn’t expelled Damsky, but the university has made clear he’s not welcome on campus. If he trespasses, he could be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor.
It’s not the racism, it’s the antisemitism.
While Damsky shares many of the sentiments of Trump’s team of white nationalists, especially Stephen Miller, who wants to deport anybody with brown skin, Damsky despises Trump for being a tool of our old friend, the International Jewish Conspiracy.
Damsky’s X account is a crazy salad of the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend pro-Iranian screeds, demands for a Palestinian state (has he noticed that Persians and Arabs are not, according to his definition, white?), attacks on conservatives deemed insufficiently pro-Caucasian, and ranting about “Black criminality.”
He’s a Florida man, all right — an antebellum Florida man.
 ‘Illegitimate revolution’
His law school papers echo Confederate Ordinances of Secession: “The negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.”
At times he sounds like South Carolina’s Jim Crow Sen. Ben Tillman, who thundered in 1900 that Black people had no rights: “We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will.”
Census projections show the U.S. will be a majority minority nation in about 2045. Appalled at the thought, Damsky calls this “an illegitimate revolution” and says white folks “cannot be expected to meekly swallow this demographic assault on their sovereignty.”
 The 14th and 15th Amendments must be repealed; non-whites, who cannot be citizens, should be given 10 years to leave the country; political violence on behalf of white hegemony is not only acceptable, it’s desirable.
Preston Damsky is not a cause, he’s a symptom, yet another white man terrified of losing the power he assumes is his God-given right.
He and the white nationalist Trump regime are unable to accept that the indigenous peoples our European ancestors displaced, killed, or locked up on reservations; the Africans kidnapped and forced into slavery to enrich the likes of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the Dred Scott decision (and apparently one of Damsky’s heroes); and the immigrants from all over the world who risked everything to get here, are what make America great.
These scared people should get out more — and read more, say, W.E.B. Du Bois’ “Black Reconstruction” or Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” or Percival Everett’s “James” or Marie Arana’s “Latinoland.”
Education is the enemy of hatred.
Most of the time.
Nevertheless, those of us who teach must keep trying to blast the Preston Damskys out of their sad, cramped little worlds by showing them the many and wonderful ways to be an American.
Damsky’s probably enjoying all this attention. That’s fine. He will no doubt go on to become an intellectual star in the white supremacist world.
He may even get an invitation to dinner at Mar-a-Lago.
But he won’t get what he wants. America never was, and never will be, a “white man’s country.”
And thank God for that.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5704-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-07 07:04:58.706672

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)After a recent wave of confirmations by the state Senate, judicial vacancies have fallen close to a level court officials have said is sustainable — but the New Jersey Legislature’s traditional summer recess that runs through Election Day risks a backslide.
The Senate last week confirmed 17 new Superior Court judges that will chip New Jersey’s court vacancies down to 33 after the new jurists are sworn in and assigned to seats on the court over the coming days, weeks, and months. At least two have been sworn in already, a court spokesperson said.
New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner has said the courts could operate sustainably with about 30 vacancies.
Kiran Sheth, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy, said Murphy is “grateful” for the new additions to the bench. In New Jersey, the governor appoints would-be judges and the Senate confirms them.
“Our Administration has been laser-focused on filling critical Superior Court vacancies to maintain a functioning Judiciary and ensure New Jerseyans get the justice they deserve in a timely manner,” Sheth said.
But at least 11 judges are expected to retire by mid-October, said New Jersey Bar Association President Christine Amalfe. Inaction through legislators’ traditional recess could swell vacancies back to levels that threaten the courts’ ability to hear certain types of cases, Amalfe said.
In recent years, judicial vacancies have caused court officials to halt civil and divorce trials in some jurisdictions because there weren’t enough judges to hear the cases. The state’s top court administrator warned lawmakers in April that Vicinage 13 — a court jurisdiction that covers Hunterdon, Somerset, and Warren counties — risked another similar stoppage.
Recent confirmations have brought that jurisdiction’s vacancies down to a single empty seat in Somerset County. Amalfe said Mercer County, where a quarter of its 24 judgeships are empty, now faces issues.
“We would like a full complement of judges. There’s a number of judges that were deemed to be the correct number in order to dispense justice given the amount of cases on the dockets,” Amalfe said. “We haven’t had that in years.”
It’s not clear whether the Senate will meet to confirm judges before November’s elections, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot.
Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), who chairs the chamber’s Judiciary Committee, did not return a call seeking comment, nor did a spokesperson for Senate Democrats.
The character of New Jersey’s vacancy crisis has shifted since Rabner issued a dire warning to lawmakers in May 2022. The courts saw about 75 vacancies that year and in 2023.
Vacancies are fewer today, but delayed trials are still a problem, especially as the courts continue to winnow a case backlog swollen by the pandemic. Amalfe, an employment attorney, said some of her cases filed in 2021 and involving facts from 2019 or 2020 were still awaiting trial. New Jersey has no speedy trial guarantee for civil matters.
“You lose witnesses. People die, people relocate, people forget. It’s a problem,” she said, adding that the delays cost clients money.
In one instance, a divorce case involving a client represented by a colleague lasted longer than the marriage it was ending, Amalfe said.
Judicial nominees are moving faster now than they have in past years. Nine would-be judges are still awaiting confirmation, and seven of them were nominated in June by Murphy. Five of those nominees would fill vacancies in Mercer County.
It’s possible the state will see a flood of judicial confirmations in this year’s lame-duck session, as it did in the final months of former Gov. Chris Christie’s second term (Murphy leaves office in January). Judicial vacancies fell to nine at the end of 2017 after 63 judges were confirmed that year.
Legislators have at times pointed to the lack of nominees to explain vacancies, and the nine unconfirmed nominees would not be enough to fully staff New Jersey’s bench.
“The Governor looks forward to filling as many judicial vacancies as possible during the final months of his term in office,” said Sheth, the Murphy spokesman.

(Photo courtesy of Kelly Waggoner)A Kansas City man spent his weekends in Cole County jail in June, after pleading guilty last year to two misdemeanor charges for submitting fraudulent documents to cannabis regulators in 2021 to obtain a marijuana cultivation license. 
It’s a license his company still holds, according to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, along with a manufacturing license issued in January 2020. 
And the state shows no signs of taking the cultivation license away from him, despite his application resulting in a criminal conviction last August.
“Neither of these licenses is operational and has never been,” the division’s spokeswoman Lisa Cox told The Independent in an email last week. “Due to the licenses being suspended and not operational, DCR has not taken any additional enforcement action at this time. DCR is currently reviewing the guilty plea and monitoring the civil litigation to determine if additional enforcement action is necessary.” 
Cox said both licenses were suspended on Jan. 19, 2023, due to internal disputes on ownership and control.
A Missouri State Highway Patrol investigation in 2023 alleged Kelly Waggoner committed 20 felonies, including identity theft, forgery and conspiracy, according to the probable cause statement investigators gave to Cole County Prosecutor Locke Thompson. 
Last summer, Thompson dropped the charges down to two misdemeanors —  identity theft and deceptive business practices. Waggoner was sentenced to a total of 10 days in jail, served on the weekends.

Without a felony conviction to make him ineligible, Waggoner retained the two cannabis manufacturing licenses held by his company, Red Tractor Cultivation LLC, where he holds 77% ownership interest.
In an interview in June, Waggoner told The Independent that he knew he was submitting erroneous documents but he only did it to “buy more time” in the application process. 
“I didn’t think I was doing anything malicious because I knew those documents, as soon as they hit DHSS would be rejected,” Waggoner said, believing cannabis regulators would give him time to fix the errors. “But that’s not how the highway patrol saw it. I made a mistake, so I have to do the time.”
When the state informed Waggoner that Red Tractor would be awarded a cultivation license in 2021, he said he and most of the minority shareholders had been in a heated ownership battle for months. 
To stall for time to reach an agreement, he said he sent in the same personal financial disclosure forms he used in 2020 for the manufacturing license. But he knowingly included errors in them, like lowering the minority shareholders’ percentages of equity without their permission so regulators would “kick them back.”
Identity theft comes in because he resubmitted pages with the shareholders’ signatures attesting to their identity — a crime the shareholders reported to the division three months after it happened, according to an October 2021 email the highway patrol reviewed as part of its investigation.
In July 2023, highway patrol investigator Sgt. Larry Nelson asked several Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation officials what they would do if his investigation ended up proving fraud, according to a recording of the interview The Independent obtained. 
Andrea Balkenbush, the division’s deputy director, said at the time, “In our rules from an administrative perspective, if we find something and we call it false and misleading information in an application… then we have the opportunity to revoke their license.” 
The Independent obtained a 2022 notice of pending revocation that the division issued in Red Tractor’s cultivation license, with a detailed timeline of the ongoing ownership dispute. 
Balkenbush told Nelson in 2023 that division officials had been dealing with ownership issues among Waggoner and the minority shareholder “for years now and they are not willing to resolve it.” 
“We’ve tried to bring them together and say, ‘Hey, sign this settlement agreement,’ but we need all parties to sign it,” she said. “But we’re not going to go and tell them, you know, that they have to kick one person out … that’s just not in our rules to do that.”
Waggoner and the minority shareholders both agree on one thing — the division revoking the licenses would be the worst outcome.
“I want to ensure that the whistleblowers who promptly informed state regulators about crimes are not penalized for reporting these violations,” stated Michael Allen, the owner of a marijuana transportation company and the director of security for Red Tractor. “For six years now, we have been excluded from this industry due to his fraud. We want to pursue our original mission and fully participate in this industry.”
‘Our dream’

In 2015, Waggoner, then a graphic designer, knew he wanted to get into the marijuana industry, he said, so he volunteered with the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, where he served as a board member for four years. 
After Missouri legalized medical marijuana in 2018, he and a friend, David Ross, joined the mad rush to form teams of marijuana experts to apply for facility licenses, he said. 
“It just kind of came together organically from friends, new friends,” Waggoner said, adding that most of them had been working in cannabis in other states. “Without them, [I] probably wouldn’t have gotten any licenses. But with them, it’s been very difficult.”
Waggoner said experts each earned “sweat equity” of up to 3.03% of the company because they completed the license applications on behalf of Red Tractor. At that time, the license had to be majority owned by a Missouri resident, so Waggoner held 77.26%.
Red Tractor ended up scoring second on its manufacturing license application, winning a license in January 2020. 
“A tremendous amount of effort and emotion went into this,” said Allen, adding that the sweat-equity group worked around the clock to complete the applications. “This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to earn a license in this industry’s launch in our home state — and we won.”

They scored 63rd for a cultivation license— the most lucrative type of license – which was just shy of the cut off. 
When the 2020 Census results came in a year later, it triggered the release of additional cultivation licenses because the Constitution mandates a minimum number of licenses to be available based on population. 
It meant Red Tractor was in line for a cultivation license. And that’s when a slowly brewing ownership battle between Waggoner and the seven sweat-equity minority shareholders — including Ross — really started to heat up. 
In April 2021, Waggoner’s attorney, Nick Kurt, sent the seven shareholders a letter that stated Waggoner was “the only proper member of the company” because he was the only person who signed the operating agreement. 
“Any ‘ownership’ purportedly granted to you as a result of the May 2016 operating agreement — signed only by Mr. Waggoner – is invalid and not recognized under Missouri law,” the letter states.   
Despite the letter, Kurt asked them to sign financial disclosure forms with their original ownership percentages – but with the caveat that Waggoner would challenge their ownership interest in the future, said Matt Brown, a Missouri native who worked in Colorado’s cannabis industry and is among the shareholders. 
That’s why they refused to sign them.
To secure the license, Waggoner reused old personal disclosure forms with their signatures on them but changed the date and reduced some of their shareholder percentages, Waggoner said. While he believed the division would flag the percentage errors and give him time to fix them, he said he also believed that the shareholders should receive a lower percentage based on the team’s early negotiations. 
The team found out about the documents during a WebEx meeting between Waggoner, the other owners and division employees several months after they were submitted, Allen said.
“I’ve worked for the Missouri State Highway Patrol,” said Allen, who has served more than 30 years in Missouri public safety agencies. “I have never, never in my life seen a three-month Division of Drug and Crime Control investigation that yielded a probable cause statement of 20 felonies be watered down to two misdemeanors.”
Thompson said the highway patrol identified a number of charges, and he “exercised prosecutorial discretion” in pursuing three felony charges in June 2024. But he said “a number of factors” played into his decision to drop it to two misdemeanors, “including the allocation of prosecutorial resources, Mr. Waggoner’s lack of documented criminal history, and the pendency of civil litigation in the matter.”
Red Tractor’s operating agreement gave the sweat-equity players rights as members to call meetings and take actions “by written consent of all members, or otherwise as agreed among the members,” it states.
In October 2021, the sweat-equity shareholders filed a lawsuit against Waggoner in Cass County Circuit Court, arguing they legitimately held a meeting as members to oust Waggoner as the manager of the company. The lawsuit is still pending.
The best outcome
  The red area of the graph shows the membership percentages Kelly Waggoner included in the personal financial disclosure documents he submitted in 2021, which were later deemed to be forged. The graph was included in documents filed as part of the Red Tractor Cultivation LLC lawsuit.
In July 2023, Nelson sat down with several Division of Cannabis Regulation leaders and its general counsel as part of his investigation into possible fraud. 
The Independent obtained a copy of an audio recording of the hour-plus meeting. 
When the minority shareholders notified the division about the signatures in the fall of 2021, division leaders told Nelson they delayed processing the application at first.
 “I think we did look into it the best we could,” Balkenbush said. “We asked questions, but we couldn’t find anything fraudulent.” 
At that point, no one at the division reported the allegation of fraud to law enforcement authorities, they said. The division general counsel, Steven Doerhoff, told Nelson that there are 400 licensed marijuana facilities with different ownership groups.
“And it’s not uncommon there’s pretty sharp business tactics,” he said. “And there’s several that have disputes going on. And this, I think this felt like an ownership dispute… and less of criminal activity.”
The shareholders went before a judge, who certified the documents as fraudulent, and that’s when Doerhoff said he forwarded it on to the prosecutor.
Nelson asked if division officials normally investigate allegations of fraudulent documents or do they wait for a judge’s order.
“This is the first time that I believe the Division of Cannabis Regulation has dealt with allegations of a fraudulent signature,” Doerhoff said. 
Balkenbush told Nelson that Red Tractor had “been one of our licensees who we’ve encountered problems with for a very long time,” regarding ownership disputes. 
The division doesn’t have the authority to do criminal investigations, she told him, but the cultivation license has been suspended.
“They can’t move forward with, like, doing a commencement inspection to become operational,” she said. “So they’re just basically sitting there.”
Doerhoff said the division lacks authority to do more than revoke, fine or suspend a license because of how the constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana was written. 
“It was probably drafted by marijuana lawyers, industry groups, all kinds of people and they didn’t put anything in there about law enforcement…so all of our powers are derived from there,” he said. “We don’t have a law enforcement arm, so that’s why we’re excited that you guys are here to help us.”
Cox told The Independent last week that the division does not intervene in internal licensee ownership disputes. 
“It is the individual owners’ responsibility to run a compliant licensed facility,” Cox said. “If such a dispute occurs, reviews of minimum standards/business change applications, etc., are placed on hold or denied, and the license may be suspended until the dispute is resolved.”  
Cox said the division may revoke a license that is suspended for more than a year due to an ownership dispute.  
“DCR may also take enforcement action on licensees for rule violations, including providing false and misleading information to DCR,” she said. “DCR makes enforcement decisions based on the totality of the circumstances.”
The sweat equity shareholders’ lawsuit is still ongoing, and Allen recognizes that the most likely outcome for them is not going to be great. A win would mean the three new managers — the minority shareholders who were elected in 2021 — would take over control of the licenses while Waggoner retains 77% of the ownership and profits.
Allen said they’d also be coming into the industry with a “negative reputation.” 
“Finding executives and investors will be challenging due to Waggoner’s history and criminal convictions,” Allen said, but it’s still something he wants to take on.
For Waggoner, he said his best outcome would be for a judge to appoint a “receiver” or someone to take over and run the company, “and do what’s best for shareholders.” 
Even if he gets no say in who the appointed manager is, Waggoner said he’d prefer that to the minority shareholders taking over — because the appointee would likely sell the licenses. A judge rejected Waggoner’s motion suggesting this in 2023. 
He told The Independent he wants out.
Waggoner said, “It’s just been a long journey.”

The college began phasing out several academic programs, including its law, accounting and finance majors last summer. Students enrolled in those programs say they were caught off-guard.

Aidan Pearl, 22, graduated in May from Champlain College with an undergraduate degree in law. He’ll be one of the last cohorts of students to graduate from the school through that program.
In June last year, the private, non-profit school began phasing out five majors — law, broadcast media production, data analytics, finance and accounting — announcing then that students would no longer be admitted for those majors beginning this upcoming fall, according to Nicole Junas, the chief executive of Junapr, a public relations firm working with Champlain College.
The move is part of a broader strategy by the Burlington-based school to design a new “career-focused” curriculum for the fall of 2026 “that is focused on and driven by employer needs and student interests,” according to a fact sheet provided to VTDigger by the college.
That effort includes redesigning the school’s 27 majors and streamlining academic offerings by merging or phasing out programs with lower enrollment numbers, according to Alex Hernandez, the college’s president.

The accounting program, for instance, saw its enrollment decline from 60 students in 2015 to 20 in February 2024, according to documents from the school’s Academic Affairs Committee. The law program, similarly, had little student interest, Hernandez said, and had only three students apply in the fall of 2023, while the data analytics program had only two applications.
“Our majors evolve over time to meet the needs of Vermont, to meet the needs of our students,” Hernandez said in an interview. “And so we’re really looking at, where are there career opportunities?”
The adjustments to curriculum, the school wrote in a fact sheet, “are not about reducing academic opportunities,” but are “about modernizing how Champlain delivers education in ways that preserve the college’s distinctive strengths while creating more room for student agency, innovation, and adaptability.”
But students who have either recently graduated, or who remain in programs being phased out, fear for the school’s future, and said the administration is playing down their impact.
As part of the college’s restructuring last year, a “very small number” of faculty members were eliminated, said Junas, the public relations executive. The college could not comment beyond that, she said, citing “individual personnel matters.” She noted though that “no widespread layoffs occurred as a result of the program phase-outs.”
Still, that has caused some consternation among the students still enrolled in the college’s accounting program and others being eliminated. (Students still enrolled in those programs will graduate with a degree).
Pearl, who served as the head of the college’s student government before graduating, estimated that 12 people were laid off, while 20 additional staff members and faculty left on their own.
“My worry is, whatever the direction is, whatever the efficacy of that plan is, we are losing people along the way that would execute that plan,” Pearl said in an interview. “I truthfully think the direction we’re going in is going to lead to the doors closing.”

‘Social capital risk’
The changes at Champlain College come as small, private colleges and universities across the country are facing tremendous financial pressures. Responding to declining enrollment and increased operating costs post-Covid, many schools have been forced to cut programs and staff, or close altogether.
Champlain College is no different. Enrollment numbers reported at the start of the school’s fall semesters have steadily declined since 2016. That year, the school enrolled 4,778 graduate and undergraduate students at the beginning of its fall semester, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.
By fall 2023, enrollment had dropped to 3,328 students, down more than 30% from 2016. This past school year, the school saw this trend continue, with roughly 3,200 undergrad and grad students enrolled in the fall of 2024, according to the college’s fact book for the 2024-25 school year.
The college’s finances, meanwhile, are facing headwinds. The school ran budget deficits in 2023, 2021 and 2019, according to publicly available tax forms filed by the non-profit.
A more than $60 million bond the school issued in 2016 to refinance its debt — and to finance the construction of the Eagles Landing student housing project on Burlington’s St. Paul Street — has weighed on the college’s cash flow.
A federal audit of the school’s finances in 2023, conducted because the school was a recipient of federal grant money, found the college was “not in compliance” with a minimum debt service coverage ratio — meant to measure whether an organization has enough cash flow to pay its debts.
The college corrected course in 2024 after bringing on a consultant, a federal audit conducted in 2024 noted. But earlier this year in May, the college’s bond rating was lowered, and its outlook downgraded to “negative” by S&P Global Ratings, which cited “the college’s history of significant enrollment declines” in its analysis.
The ratings agency noted in their report there was a “social capital risk, as fewer graduating high school students expected in the region” may continue to put pressure on the college’s enrollment expectations. 
Their negative outlook “reflects our expectation that as both enrollment and operations remain pressured,” the school will have to draw from its endowment or reserve funds, “further worsening financial resource ratios” compared to the college’s peers, the ratings agency wrote.
Hernandez, the college’s president, remains optimistic, and said the school has been “really strategic and worked really hard to improve our finances over the last couple of years.”
While 990 tax filings are not yet available for 2024, Hernandez said the college “made an important step forward in 2024” to improve the school’s financial health.
“We expect to do that again in 2025,” he said.

‘Growing our community’
The school’s recent reorganization is meant to lean in on the school’s strengths, Hernandez said. While several programs are being phased out, Hernandez said schools are being “redesigned” to offer a more fluid education for students.
The college now offers 27 different majors for its on-campus students, Junas said, while more than 130 degree and certificate programs are available through both the school’s in-person curriculum and through Champlain College Online, which Hernandez noted has seen growing enrollment in recent years.
Hernandez said there was a “natural evolution” of adding, redesigning or stopping programs.
Hernandez, who teaches entrepreneurship in the college’s Robert P. Stiller School of Business, noted that while an accounting program is no longer available, students are still offered accounting classes through the school’s new Business Administration major.
“We’re moving towards a more flexible approach to our business programs, where you can study things like entrepreneurship, finance, accounting underneath a broad business umbrella,” Hernandez said. “It’s just a different strategy.”
The college has added programs in years past, including an animation and sonic arts program, Hernandez said. The school’s Game Design major has been ranked by The Princeton Review as one of the top ten Game Design programs in the country, alongside institutions like the University of Southern California and New York University.
Champlain College was also one of the first in the country to offer an undergraduate cybersecurity major, Hernandez said, which has since been nationally designated by the National Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity and by the National Security Agency, according to the school’s website.
“Part of growing our community, growing our enrollment on the on-campus side, is really driven by this new curriculum and the vision for what experiential, hands-on, flexible learning looks like in this world of AI, in this world where students need experience when they go out into the job market,” he said.
He added that, “more than anything, we’re just trying to stay focused on, how does higher education, how can Champlain College, evolve to meet the moment that we’re in knowing that there’s a lot of challenges right now for the sector.”
But amid these trends, students and faculty members who spoke to VTDigger say they are uncertain of the college’s strategy.
With fewer professors and academics on staff, some fear it will lead to a worsening educational quality, which could further compound declines in enrollment.
One student, still in the college’s business school who requested anonymity to speak candidly out of fear of retaliation, said the college has relied increasingly on adjunct professors since faculty from the school were let go. The quality of teaching they’ve brought in, the student said, “has not been up to the standard it should be.”
“It’s not prepping people for what they need,” they said. “They have said that they are going to give us the same quality of education that we’ve had in the past — which I think that most people would agree that it hasn’t been.”
Pearl said the changes were not effectively communicated to the broader community, and the cuts to programs in 2024 led to worries among the student body.
“At that time, students were finding out about the layoffs and the departures, because those faculty and staff were messaging students and saying, ‘Hey, I’m leaving,'” he said. “The correspondence we got was very much not aligned with the severity of what was going on. Most students didn’t learn of the full extent of the layoffs until the fall.”
Hernandez and Junas pushed back on that criticism. A fact sheet provided to VTDigger stated the college “communicated its academic program adjustments clearly and directly to the campus community in June 2024, with specific outreach to students enrolled in affected majors.”

‘Climate of uncertainty’
Faculty members also expressed concern the college was not fully committed to its existing programs and faculty members.
According to records and minutes of the school’s Academic Affairs Committee obtained by VTDigger, some in the college were hesitant to eliminate a program like accounting. While the committee ultimately voted to approve the discontinuance, concerns remained.
“The thought of having a named business school without offering an accounting major may have negative effects on the school overall,” the committee wrote. “Given the evidence, and the college’s need to boost enrollment, this seems like a major that the college may want to invest in rather than cut.
“However, given the curricular transition that the college is currently experiencing, that opportunity may not fit the direction the college has chosen to pursue,” the committee wrote. “In such a climate of uncertainty, this was a very difficult decision for this committee.”
One former faculty member, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said it was disconcerting to see “programs that had been there for a while, people who had been there for a while, sort of just being cast aside.”
Pearl said he agreed broadly the school should tighten its belts amid declining enrollment. “I will not defend that the law program should have stayed. The law program was declining,” he said.
But he worried programs with high career success rates, like accounting, were being eliminated. 
“We let good programs die that truthfully, had we put more investment into them, I think would have done the college a lot of good,” he said.
Hernandez disagreed, telling VTDigger that 90% of students who leave Champlain College “are employed or have a successful career outcome within six months of graduation,” while over 80% of students take jobs in the fields they studied.
But “if we don’t have enough students for a program, it’s challenging to run a program,” he said.
Hernandez is confident in the college’s ability to transform and “to really meet the moment that we’re in right now.”
“It’s no secret that higher education as a sector is experiencing a lot of different challenges,” he said. “We’ve been really intentional and strategic around that — we’re designing a new curriculum right now that is intended to be even more experiential, even more flexible.”
But faculty members worry that with fewer programs, declines in enrollment may only continue.
“You have to bring in a certain critical mass of students,” said another former faculty member who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “And if those students aren’t there to bring in, you start running in the red.”

(Christopher Smith for KFF Health News)Four years before Kimberly Gallagher enrolled in Medicaid herself, the public health insurance program’s rules prompted her to make an excruciating choice — to give up guardianship of her son so she could work as his caregiver.
Now, another proposed twist in the rules could mean that, even though Missouri pays her to do that work, she might still have to prove to the state that she’s not unemployed.
The Kansas City resident has cared for her disabled son, Daniel, for all 31 years of his life. A rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome, in addition to autism, left him with an intellectual disability; a constant, excessive hunger; and an inability to speak. His needs left Gallagher, an elementary school teacher by training, with little opportunity to work outside her home.
As congressional Republicans consider slashing about $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending, Gallagher is among the 18.5 million Americans who could be required to prove that they work enough to keep their health insurance.
Budget bills in the House and Senate would require 80 hours of work or community service a month for adults who are insured through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion program, which has allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults with low incomes. Forty states, plus Washington, D.C., have expanded their programs, additions that now cover about 20 million Americans, including Gallagher.
She enrolled in the coverage in December 2023, after she could no longer afford her private insurance. Before her husband died of cancer in 2019, the couple paid for private insurance and supported themselves on the income he earned as a master watchmaker. After his death, Gallagher was left to earn a living and find insurance on her own. At 59, she’s too young to collect her husband’s Social Security survivor benefit.

The Medicaid program that pays for in-home care for Daniel and 8,000 other Missourians with disabilities allows family members to be compensated for caregiving, but only if they’re not the legal guardian of the person they care for. So, Gallagher went to court to give up her rights to make decisions for her son and transfer authority to her parents.
“I think it’s appalling that it’s required, but it was necessary,” she said. “There was no way I could work outside of taking care of Daniel.”
Republicans have touted Medicaid work requirements both as a way to reduce federal spending on the program and as a moral imperative for Americans.
“Go out there. Do entry-level jobs. Get into the workforce. Prove that you matter. Get agency into your own life,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a recent interview on Fox Business.
Democrats, meanwhile, have cast the requirements as bureaucratic red tape that won’t meaningfully increase employment but will cause eligible people to lose their health insurance because of administrative hurdles.
Indeed, the vast majority of Americans enrolled in Medicaid expansion are already working, caregiving, attending school, or have a disability, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
And while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement included in the House bill would cause 4.8 million Americans to lose their insurance, only about 300,000 of those people are unemployed because of lack of interest in working, according to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group. Recent history in states that have tried work requirements suggests technical and paperwork problems have caused a substantial portion of coverage losses.
Still, the provisions are generally popular among Republican lawmakers and the public. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has repeatedly cautioned against cutting people off from Medicaid, has signaled support for adding work requirements.
And 68% of Americans favor the requirement described in the House bill, according to a recent poll conducted by KFF. But support for work requirements dropped as low as 35% when respondents learned that most Medicaid recipients already work and could lose their coverage because of paperwork requirements.
That’s what happened in Arkansas, where 18,000 people lost their Medicaid coverage in 2018 after the state phased in a work requirement. Thousands more were on pace to lose coverage in 2019 before a federal judge halted the requirement, largely over concerns about coverage losses. In discussions with focus groups, KFF found that many Arkansas Medicaid participants did not fully understand the requirements, despite the state’s outreach efforts, and some people didn’t receive mailed notices. Others were confused because the work-reporting paperwork and separate forms to renew Medicaid coverage asked for similar information.
Many family caregivers would be exempt from the work requirements proposed in Congress, but Gallagher probably would not, since she had to relinquish guardianship of her son to be paid for the work. While the hours she already logs should be enough to satisfy the requirement, she’ll need to report them again — unless the state can identify her through its existing data. But Missouri has a history of procedural problems in the state agency that administers Medicaid.

In early 2022, for example, Missouri was taking more than 100 days on average to process applications for Medicaid expansion, a wait that prompted patients to put off needed care and was more than twice the processing time allowed by federal law.
And 79% of the more than 378,000 Missourians who lost Medicaid coverage when covid-era enrollment protections ended in 2023 did so because of procedural reasons.
The next year, a federal judge ruled that Missourians were illegally being denied food aid by the state, in part because insufficient staffing at call centers left eligible people without assistance.
“They’re historically understaffed,” Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the state agency that administers Medicaid and food assistance. “I think that’s really the underlying problem.”
McBride’s analysis of Missouri’s Medicaid recipients found that fewer than 45,000 of the people enrolled in expansion in 2023 were unemployed for reasons other than caregiving, disability, attending school, or retirement. But more than twice that many Missourians could lose their insurance if work requirements prompt disenrollment rates similar to Arkansas’ implementation, according to a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes government policies.
The estimate assumes many otherwise eligible people would still lose coverage as a result of falling through the cracks, McBride said.
Hawley, who backed the Senate bill, declined to comment for this article. The senator previously told reporters that “we can sort that out” when asked about eligible people inadvertently losing Medicaid because of work requirements.
Gallagher worries about her coverage, because she recently was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland. She said she had to search for her Medicaid card to fill the prescription that followed, having barely used it in the year in a half she’s been covered.
She also worries about her son’s Medicaid. A nursing home is not a realistic option, considering his needs. His coverage doubles as Gallagher’s only source of income and also pays for other caregivers, when she can find them, who give her breaks to tend to her own health and to her aging parents.
But nearly all in-home services like those Daniel receives are optional programs that states are not required to include in their Medicaid programs. And the magnitude of the cuts being proposed have prompted fears that the optional programs could be chopped.
“It would destroy our lives,” Gallagher said. “The only income we would have would be Daniel’s Social Security.”

(Photo by Jane Hawkey/ Integration and Application Network, UMCES)When they last signed a Chesapeake Bay cleanup agreement in 2014, officials from seven jurisdictions set ambitious targets and a hard deadline of 2025.
They didn’t quite make it.
So as they drafted the next agreement, which was released to the public Tuesday, they did things a little differently: Some targets shifted, deadlines were staggered and some goals have yet to be set, awaiting new computer modeling that will show the most up-to-date picture of bay pollutants.
The preliminary plan includes refreshed goals for oyster restoration, underwater grass acreage, public access sites and wetland plantings, among a host of other subjects. And that’s before terms like “diversity” and “climate change” were tweaked at the request of the Trump administration.
But officials think the plan, months in development and still months from completion, will be worth it.
“One thing we’ve heard over and over again — and frankly, for probably since the beginning of time with this agreement — is the need for it to be something that people actually can understand and see themselves in. And I think we worked really hard to make sure that each one of these outcomes did just that,” said Maryland Secretary of Natural Resources Josh Kurtz, who chairs the Chesapeake Bay Program committee that was behind Tuesday’s revisions.
For the first time since the Key Bridge collapse, oysters are being planted nearby

The draft plan includes different deadlines for different outcomes: Some goals are set for 2030, many are in 2035 or 2040. Kurtz said that allowed for a more individualized approach to each goal, making use of the latest science.
“That’s one of the places we’re most excited to get feedback from the public,” Kurtz said. “Is 10 years right? Is 15 years right? Do we want to set targets that are more interim?”
One of the key goals of the 2014 plan was to limit nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and sediment pollution, the villains behind the bay’s oxygen-deprived summer “dead zones” where crabs, oysters and fish can no longer survive. Sediment goals had been met by last year, but the six bay states and the District of Columbia had achieved only 92% of phosphorous reduction goals and 59% of the nitrogen target, despite billions being spent.
The new plan gives experts until 2030 to develop a goal for nutrients and sediment, as they await new data from an updated computer model that estimates pollution flow, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which convenes lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia to discuss bay issues.
“That process of updating the model takes time, and has to be peer reviewed. And so, we’re not in a place where we can speed that up, and really still call it sound, good science,” Killius said. “We can’t really put new numbers in place — or ask the jurisdictions to plan around those numbers — until we’ve got that model up and running.”
The nutrient and sediment targets are not likely to change, since they were set in 2010 by the Environmental Protection Agency. The new plan will likely focus on a new timeline or methodology for achieving the total maximum daily load, or TMDL.
“We’re working with the how,” Killius said. “So, what is going to be our plan of attack in getting to what the TMDL tells us we need to do?”
The new computer modeling was originally expected January, but officials now expect about a yearlong delay before that’s done, said Lee McDonnell, acting director of the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program office.
Kurtz said Bay Program officials understand that the lack of new nutrient and sediment timelines may “lend a feeling of uncertainty” to the bay restoration effort.
“That’s why we’re going to be doing a lot of public outreach,” Kurtz said, including about the computer model.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Keisha Sedlacek, federal director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the number of “gaps and holes” in the 2025 draft are a concern — in some places, including goals for conserved lands, the draft includes blanks in lieu of specific numbers. She would also like to see a consistent deadline, such as 2040, with periodic check-ins along the way.
“If we set these interim targets and actually evaluate the program — not every 10 years, but every couple of years — to see what tweaks we need to make based on the best available science, we’ll have a stronger, more efficient program moving forward,” Sedlacek said.
The update comes at a time of uncertain federal support for bay cleanup programs. The Trump administration has moved to slash funding for agencies that assist with bay clean-up, including the EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — but it has so far proposed stable funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program, which Trump had targeted for elimination during his first term.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents about 300 environmental organizations in the bay region, said the $92 million in funding for the Bay Program, while it is critical, is only “one piece of the puzzle.”
“These states and federal agencies are recommitting to the work and coming up with these revised goals and outcomes,” Reilly said, “when it’s being proposed that the infrastructure around achieving them could be gone.”
Mindful of the administration’s antipathy toward climate change and DEI, Reilly said some language in the document changed at the request of federal agencies. While the 2014 agreement cited “climate resiliency,” the 2025 version references “changing environmental conditions.” The 2025 draft also jettisons a reference to “diversity” in clean-up efforts, instead calling for a  “wide range of engaged individuals whose communities enjoy access to the waters and natural landscapes of the region.”
Killius said the committee wanted to bypass buzzwords and focus on “saying what we mean.”
Killius said the new bay agreement was also informed by a groundbreaking 2023 study, called the Comprehensive Evaluation of System response, or CESR. That report cited a number of reasons for the struggle to attain the 2025 goals — and for the bay’s lackluster response to the pollution reductions achieved thus far — including the possibility that the Bay Program’s current computer model could be overestimating phosphorus reductions.

But mainly, while jurisdictions were able to cut pollution from wastewater treatment plants and other “point” sources, they struggled to reduce pollution from “nonpoint” sources, including farm fields and city streets.
The report delivered a sobering message: Portions of the bay, especially the deepest reaches, may never meet standards for criteria such as dissolved oxygen. Targeting shallow-water areas, and triggering an ecosystem turnaround, could have more impact on the health of the bay than focusing on the total nutrient runoff and its impact on the deep channel.
Killius points to a section in the revised agreement about fish habitat, which calls for a focus on improving “the quantity and quality of shallow water fish habitat in tidal areas.” Kurtz points to revised oyster goals, which include mention of aquaculture and the native fishery, rather than on oyster sanctuaries — where no harvesting occurs.
But some observers worry that the agreement hasn’t gone far enough to address nonpoint source pollution and restore ecosystems. That includes Gerald Winegrad, a former state senator and vocal critic of current bay policy.
He noted that some goals were revised downward, including for forested lands and wetlands. While the 2014 agreement called for states to “create or re-establish 85,000 acres of tidal and non-tidal wetlands” by 2025, the draft calls for 3,000 restored acres by 2035.
“When you look at forest cover, and you look at [forest] buffers, and you look at wetlands — three very important things, like the heart, lungs, kidneys of the bay — it is a complete flop compared to what was already required,” Winegrad said of the draft document.
He was frustrated, too, that the agreement didn’t specifically mention the TMDL numbers for nutrient and sediment reductions — or set a new deadline.
“This has been kicking the can down the road, moving the goal post — all the worst little idioms you can use to say that there is no political courage to really restore the Chesapeake Bay with the hard choices that have to be made,” Winegrad said.
Targets for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation were also revised down from a goal of 130,000 acres by 2025, to interim targets of 90,000 acres by 2030 and 95,000 acres by 2035.

Leila Duman, Chesapeake and coastal bays restoration officer for Maryland DNR, said the ultimate goal is still to reach 196,000 acres of grass coverage across the entire bay.
“That said, that’s not something we can get to in the next 10 years,” Duman said. “Part of this revision process was really about making goals achievable.”
The agreement also includes altogether new goals, such as a first-time goal for freshwater mussels, calling for development of mussel conservation plans in five bay tributaries by 2035. Filter feeders, like mussels and oysters, remove harmful nutrients from the water, making them a critical piece of the effort to cut pollution in the estuary.
“The oyster goal is so important,” Kurtz said. “But that really is focused on the tidal part. And what mussels really gets us is more of that work in the freshwater space.”
On the bay’s beloved blue crabs, the draft agreement calls for keeping the fishery at sustainable levels, but defers to a baywide stock assessment, which is coming out in 2026, on what the population levels ought to be.
Kurtz acknowledged that not all parts of the draft plan use specific numbers just yet.

Brett Lindstrom became the second Republican to join the race for the open U.S. House seat.","Former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who has entered the race to be the GOP candidate for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Former Omaha State Sen. Brett Lindstrom has entered the race to be the Republican nominee to defend the Republican held 2nd Congressional District open seat. 
“I’m running as a common-sense conservative to protect retirees and fight for working families … focused on the future and national security,” Lindstrom said. 
Lindstrom, 44, on Monday became the second Republican to join the race. 
He was long rumored to be one of the GOP candidates to jump into the Republican primary if Rep. Don Bacon chose not to run again in 2026. Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding announced his bid last week. Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei, is mulling a bid. 
Lindstrom emphasized that he doesn’t “really get caught up” in who’s in the race, but looks forward to people getting to know him and the other candidates, then deciding the best candidate to represent them. Lindstrom said he is a “proven candidate” with a “proven record” of getting things done.

The former state lawmaker who represented northwest Omaha in the Nebraska Capitol from 2015 to 2023 said he has a track record of a “pragmatic” and “common-sense” approach. Lindstrom was known for pushing bills that reduced state income taxes. He also voted to repeal the death penalty in the state, which was reinstated through a ballot measure in 2016.
Lindstrom pointed to his role in passing legislation that phased out taxes on Social Security income. He said he wants to bring that to the Hill. President Donald Trump’s recently passed “big beautiful bill” does provide new temporary tax deductions for Social Security, but it doesn’t eliminate the tax on the federal program. 
Lindstrom, a financial advisor, said he has been able to “meet the challenges” the district faced during his time as a state senator, and is looking to “continue to do that.” He said he wants to bring a different kind of leadership to Washington, an approach focused on “real results, not partisan fights, because that’s what Nebraska deserves.”   
He was one of the Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan statehouse to survive the 2018 “blue wave.” This would be Lindstrom’s fifth campaign for elected office – he unsuccessfully ran to be the Republican nominee for governor in 2022. Most of his support during that bid came from Omaha.
 The 2nd Congressional District is the state’s most politically diverse and competitive — and could prove one of the most expensive races in Congress for the 2026 midterms.  
Democrats already have a crowded field in the primary. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and Omaha State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis are also running. Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, a Democrat, has said she is considering a House bid.
Lindstrom has endorsements from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha and former State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon. 
Harding has the endorsements of U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, former Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, and State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha. He also received the endorsement of former Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, who endorsed Lindstrom for governor in 2022. 
Lindstrom said his time in the Nebraska Legislature has given him the experience to handle the “complexity” of Washington.
“The message and [my] work ethic will speak for itself,” he said.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, speaks at a confirmation hearing for Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. (screenshot courtesy of C-SPAN via Investigate Midwest)I googled: “Josh Hawley SNAP,” a few weeks ago when I was looking for our Senator’s position on cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka SNAP, or food stamps).
The AI told me that “Josh Hawley SNAP” refers to a snap of Hawley on January 6th cheering supporters of his effort to overturn the 2020 election for Trump, or to the gif of Hawley running away from them later that day.
I laughed at the bad AI, but it was right. It put the violent images of January 6th in my head when I was trying to understand the likely fate of SNAP and Medicaid. Fair point, robot, these things are related.
Many people thought Hawley was being disingenuous all along about protecting Medicaid. I criticized his support for work requirements that Missouri is incapable of administering without depriving eligible people of their health care. But Hawley talked so much about protecting Medicaid that even I held out hope he would refuse to back the other massive cuts.
I’ve tried to imagine how Hawley could crusade as a defender of Medicaid, SNAP, and the working class, then go on vote for the largest transfer of wealth to the wealthy in U.S. history, including a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid. 
There is a non-zero possibility that he remembers running from the MAGA mob, and it affected his ability to vote for what he told us he believed. 
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has said that when representatives speak out or vote against the preferences of Trump, it comes with “death threats or worse.” This is consistent with other Republicans reportedly telling colleagues they couldn’t vote to impeach Trump because they feared for the safety of their families. 
Murkowski, unlike Hawley, sounded the alarm about the fact that Republicans’ reams of red tape will gut Alaskans’ practical ability to maintain their benefits. Like Hawley, she explained that changes to the medical provider tax that states use to fund Medicaid will devastate rural hospitals. Then Murkowski and Hawley both voted for the devastation they’d loudly warned of.
U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was reportedly told by the FBI of credible threats to his life when it looked like he might not vote to confirm Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Tillis ultimately voted to confirm.
But Tillis has long objected to the gutting of Medicaid and, unlike Hawley, he stood by those objections.
Trump excoriated Tillis on his Truth Social and announced Tillis would be primaried. Facing a tough re-election, Tillis said he wouldn’t run again so he’d be free to act in the interests of his constituents in the time he had left.
That took bravery. Tillis knows that when Trump puts a target on someone’s back, it isn’t just an electoral one.
Trump has a long history of endorsing violence, but he is now openly unapologetic about how central it is to his approach to governing: do what I say or get very badly hurt. It’s the antithesis of democracy, but it’s effective.
Trump has normalized political violence in ways I never thought possible, and I knew about his violent tendencies back in 2016. Trump said there were “good people on both sides” of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville where a counter-protestor was murdered. He joked about an assailant fracturing the skull of Paul Pelosi with a hammer. He pardoned even his supporters who attacked and injured police officers on January 6th. 
Last month, Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman were assassinated. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman were shot but were saved by surgeons. A manhunt followed that was harrowing for Minnesotans. 
In a normal world, the U.S. president would have given a national address condemning political violence. Trump refused to even call the governor. 
The undercurrent of violence is everywhere. Masked men who you can’t be sure are law enforcement are grabbing people off the street. Our immigrants are being sent to a gulag in El Salvador where they are starved and beaten. Or sent to local prisons, or the new domestic camp without due process. 
One January 6 rioter was on trial when Trump pardoned him. He had yelled at fellow rioters attacking the police to “Kill ‘em! kill ‘em!” That rioter has now been hired by the Department of Justice’s working group on retribution for Trump’s enemies.
Trump sicced his followers on a journalist because she reported the fact that U.S. intelligence agencies don’t believe his bombing campaign obliterated Iran’s nuclear program.
Hawley has a safe seat here in red Missouri. He would have had less electoral risk than Tillis or Murkowski if he’d chosen to stand by his principles and vote against Trump’s gutting of MO HealthNet and SNAP. But Hawley ran scared from the MAGAs once again, either because crossing Trump would end his presidential aspirations, or because he fears the more immediate kind of threat that he experienced on January 6th.
Asked about the bill he voted for, Hawley said that the Republican party needs to do some “soul searching” because they are “tak[ing] health care away from working people.” 
He should do his own soul searching.
Hawley is telling us that Trump was correct when he said: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.”
An estimated 170,000 Missourians are going to lose their health care. That means many, many more Missourians than could pack into a block of New York’s Fifth Avenue will die. 
Trump was right. He’d never lose Hawley’s vote. Trump is free to shoot away.

Tony Evers made his 2025-27 budget proposal in February, it included an annual $100 million appropriation to fund the broadly popular Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program for another 10 years. The budget he signed after 1 a.m. Thursday included zero money for the program, which is set to lapse next summer. 
While a separate piece of legislation to re-authorize the program has been introduced by Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), the failure to provide added money in the budget has raised concerns that the program — which allows the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to provide grant funding to acquire, conserve and maintain public lands — could fail to survive the political tumult of divided government and die. 
Even though the conservation of public lands is widely popular among both Democratic and Republican voters in the state, a handful of Republican legislators have grown increasingly hostile to the program, particularly since the state Supreme Court ruled last year that the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance doesn’t have the authority to hold up grants issued by the DNR through the program. Republicans complain that the acquisition of public land takes parcels off the property tax roles and prevents development projects. 
The Kurtz and Testin proposal aims to reach a compromise by re-authorizing the program while adding more legislative oversight by requiring that any land purchases over $1 million be approved through legislation. 
“While I recognize all that has gone into reaching this compromise budget, I must share that I am deeply disappointed that Republican leaders would not agree to reauthorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program — even for just one more year through 2027,” Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) said in a statement. “Here’s the situation now: Knowles-Nelson reauthorization expires on June 20, 2026, giving the Legislature one year to take action before the deadline, and Republicans have indicated they will bring this back to the agenda this fall. Trust that I will keep up the pressure on Republicans and hold them to their word. I will continue to be a strong advocate for this long-standing bipartisan promise.” 
The lack of stewardship program funds in the final state budget led Evers to use his partial veto authority to prevent spending money on five individual public lands projects that legislators had earmarked in the bill. 
“I object to providing an earmark for a natural resources project when the Legislature has abandoned its responsibility to reauthorize and ensure the continuation of the immensely popular Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program,” Evers stated in his veto message.  “Instead of renewing the program and helping the many, the Legislature has opted to benefit the politically connected few. The Legislature must do its job and renew the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program.”
Timber strategic plan 
The DNR budget also includes funds for a $1 million grant to the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association (GLTPA) and the Wisconsin Paper Council to craft a Forestry Industrywide Strategic Plan. 
This provision was included by the Joint Committee on Finance in its late night session last Friday and has raised concerns from some environmental groups that it is a giveaway to industry groups to push for increased extraction of resources from the state’s forest lands. 
“Taxpayers should not be made to underwrite private industry studies with no public benefit or input. Would they decide how to manage local, state, and federal forests in this study? Would it be published?” Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said. “One million dollars is very generous with taxpayer dollars for a sketchy study  with no public benefit.”
The GLTPA has been involved in efforts in Wisconsin’s Northwoods to oppose conservation projects and move local land use policies to be more pro-extraction by encouraging increased logging and the expansion of the state’s mining industry. 
The association’s director, Henry Schienebeck, has been influential in Oneida County’s effort to rewrite its comprehensive plan to be friendlier to industry and worked with American Stewards of Liberty, a Texas-based right-wing anti-conservation group, to oppose land conservation such as the Pelican River Forest. 
DNR spokesperson Andrea Sedlacek said the department is “monitoring this and all other relevant DNR budget motions as the process plays out” but did not yet have information on what the development of the strategic plan would look like or if other people or groups would be involved in its development. 
But despite the grant being given only to industry groups, some environmental advocates say it’s a win. 
Fred Clark, former executive director of Wisconsin Green Fire, said the development of such a plan is something the organization has been advocating for over the past several years. Clark pointed to a study of the health of the state’s forests Green Fire published last year and said that because the state’s paper mills have largely been shuttered, there are fewer  places for the state’s foresters to bring their timber, destabilizing the industry. 
Without a plan to find new uses for the state’s timber, the economics of Wisconsin’s working forest lands could change, resulting in land sales and development that results in forests being cut down to use the land for other purposes — ultimately harming the health of Wisconsin’s forests. 
“The focus that we would like to see there is not necessarily on producing more timber, because we already grow a lot more timber than we harvest,” Clark said. “What we really think the state needs is a strategic focus on developing new forest products and helping expand and refine forest products markets so that we’ve got places for our wood to go.”
Clark said he foresees the development of the plan working through the state’s Council on Forestry, which includes members representing industry, environmental groups, state and federal agencies, legislators and landowners. He added that for the project to succeed it needs input from all those groups, including those with records such as the GLTPA. 
“We need everybody at the table for this, and there’s a wide range of points of view in the forestry community,” Clark said. “Great Lakes Timber Professionals have been an active member of the Council on Forestry almost since day one. We won’t succeed if we don’t have a pretty strong consensus all the way from the environmental groups to groups like Great Lakes Timber Professionals. So I think there’s a lot of common ground there. The most important next step for us is to see that there’s a really broad based committee within the Council on forestry that’s helping guide this work.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Amid struggles with data collection and participation, two Republican lawmakers want to probe the long-term effectiveness of a state program designed to nurture new small businesses.
Rep. Chris Banning, R-Bixby, and Rep. Mike Lay, R-Jenks, said they want to examine the effectiveness of the state’s small business incubator program to determine if it is having the intended long-term impact, if it is being marketed effectively and if any changes need to be made to it.
The incubator program, which was created in 1988 through the Oklahoma Small Business Incubators Incentives Act, provides startup businesses with state tax exemptions for up to 10 years with an aim of diversifying local economies.
Incubators offer a variety of services to startup entrepreneurs, like providing office space and financial advice, with the goal of helping small businesses become financially viable and freestanding. Some incubators may qualify for additional support from local governments, universities and business development organizations.
A 2024 annual report released by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce found that there were 26 certified incubators and that 152 small businesses leased space from those incubators. The program created a total of 374 full-time jobs, 112 part-time employment opportunities and 43 internships, according to an analysis by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. The program focused on supporting startups owned by women and minorities as well as environmental projects and telecommunications, according to the agency’s website.
Tenants generated $66.6 million in revenue and qualified for $3.3 million in tax exemptions, according to a 2023 analysis released by the state’s Incentive Evaluation Commission. The analysis found that 14 of the 25 incubators were in urban counties with seven operating in either Oklahoma City or Tulsa
The state Department of Commerce did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Banning said the program would benefit from incorporating business analytics to improve data collection and reporting.
“If you’re going to accept this help, then somehow you would need to report back on how it helped you, so it can help others, just like how we do a 10-year census,” Banning said.
Lay said he would like to see the state refine its metrics to assess the program’s impact.
“Are these programs working, or are there improvements to be made?” Lay asked.
He said businesses may not be aware of the program’s existence, which raises additional questions about how well it’s being marketed by the Department of Commerce.
Brad Rickelman, secretary and treasurer of Oklahoma Business Incubator Association, said the program’s impact is difficult to measure due to challenges with data collection and reporting. His group focuses on the needs of Oklahoma’s entrepreneurs and works with startups in their early stages when they’re most vulnerable.
“The incentives are a nice way to raise visibility, not only causing interest but also helping grow businesses, even if there is a cost,” he said.
The National Business Innovation Association found that 87% of all businesses that graduated from incubator programs remained in existence after five years, the group said.
Oklahoma’s analysis found that over 780 small businesses have graduated from an incubator since the program’s inception over three decades ago. The state’s program website does not show how many are still in existence.
Rickelman said Oklahoma’s program needs a closer look. He said that better data reporting and collection would help increase the program’s visibility and showcase its successes. A lack of accurate data makes it difficult for lawmakers to assess the program’s effectiveness, he said.
Oklahoma’s incubator programs, meanwhile, need to better communicate the critical role they play in providing entrepreneurial support in communities outside of major cities and in bringing talent and skills into underserved areas, he said.
Janet Schwabe, a member of the Oklahoma Business Incubator Association and manager of the Pioneer Technology Center, a technical school incubator in Ponca City, said the current data collection process can result in incomplete or inconsistent information.
According to the Oklahoma Commerce Small Business Incubator annual report, the data reported comes from the incubator managers themselves.
Schwabe said this process can result in incomplete or inconsistent information.
“There are a lot of great stories about the tenants, but not enough statistical data,” she said. “We need to work harder to get better data.”
Another challenge is the lack of awareness, which limits the program’s effectiveness, and keeps many potential tenants unaware of what incubators offer, Schwabe said.
She said she is considering rebranding Pioneer Tech and changing the term “incubator” to something more easily understood.
“We’re hoping to build a new facility to bring in larger manufacturers and rebrand the name ‘incubator’ because a lot of people don’t know what it is,” she said.

(Courtesy of Blue Cross of Idaho)At 16 years old, Annette Tipton went to an early iteration of the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs’ youth events. 
She talked with students from around Idaho, learned about regional universities and even won scholarships for speech and talent competitions. 
In May, Idaho Gov. Brad Little appointed her as the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs’ new executive director. She looks forward to building on the agency’s work and mentoring a new generation of young professionals.
“I hope in some way, I’ll be able to inspire, to mentor, to guide — whether it’s young people in high school starting their college careers, or those who are young professionals looking to increase their capacity and to augment what they’re doing in their careers as a newly young professional,” Tipton told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “… It’s that sense of paying it forward.”
Idaho Hispanic commission director retires after 28 years with agency

Tipton is taking over the agency after its longtime executive director, Margie Gonzalez, retired after nearly three decades. The non-partisan state agency gathers and publishes statistics, bridges community and government entities, provides recommendations to policymakers and hosts youth summits. 
She most recently worked for the Idaho State Controller’s Office. She also ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Idaho Legislature last year, challenging Boise Democratic Rep. Steve Berch. 
In a statement, Little said he’s confident Tipton will serve Idaho’s Hispanic community well.
“Idaho’s Hispanic community is an integral part of the fabric of our state. For decades, Margie Gonzalez served Hispanic Idahoans and the state with remarkable dedication,” the governor said. “I am confident Annette will continue this legacy, building on the growth and energy within the community and serving Hispanic Idahoans with that same commitment.”
Last month, Little announced Idaho State Police would partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to transport immigrants who are convicted of a crime and are not authorized to be in the U.S. to ICE detention centers for deportation.
Asked how the Idaho Commission of Hispanic Affairs will represent Idaho’s immigrant community, Tipton said agency officials will be available to refer community members who need resources to other groups, like the Mexican Consulate Office or the ACLU.
“We don’t handle those things. But we are more than happy to connect to people who need support and to be directed to where they need to go. That’s the type of support our office is able to offer,” Tipton told the Sun.

 ‘My world started out in Idaho’

Tipton grew up in southern Idaho’s Rupert, raised by migrant farmworkers, she told the Sun. 
One of the things her mom “always instilled in her girls was hard work, service and education,” Tipton said. “It was never a question of if we were going on to college; it was when we do.”
She went on to work for U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and for large financial institutions like JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and CIT Group Inc. 
Then she met her husband and returned to Idaho.

“My world started out in Idaho, and I’ve come back home to do what I can here more locally — to serve our community overall,” Tipton said. 
Along the way, she also volunteered with the Idaho Hispanic Caucus, the Idaho Latino Scholarship Foundation and worked for a year in outreach and enrollment for Terry Reilly Health Services, a federally qualified health center in Idaho. 
In May 2020, Tipton joined the Idaho State Controller’s Office. She worked there for nearly five years, with Idaho’s largest cities and counties and some of the smallest local government entities — special districts for mosquito, sewer and water, she told the Sun.
At the State Controller’s Office, she led Idaho’s establishment of a statewide integrated data system called Insight Idaho. But whenever other work came up, she was quick to help, Idaho Deputy Controller John Iasonides told the Sun in an interview.
She was instrumental in helping Idaho deploy over $1 billion in federal CARES Act funding that stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. 
“I always like to use the term a great utility player,” Iasonides said. “Because it didn’t matter if her main focus was the Insight Idaho project. If we needed something, some help with something else … I could call on her and she could jump into it really easy.”
He described Tipton as a driven person who works well with limited guidance and “prides herself on doing good work.”
“She’s very much, like, ‘Just good enough is not enough’” Iasonides said.
 Idaho’s Hispanic population is younger. Tipton eyes opportunities for mentorship.

Tipton is already planning the agency’s next youth summit events. She wants to continue publishing statistics through the agency’s Hispanic profile data book. And the agency is undergoing a rebranding effort that involves a website overhaul, a new mission and logos, she said.
In academics and her professional career, Tipton said she leaned on guidance from mentors. That’s part of what she hopes to bring into her new role as agency director.
“A lot of why I believe this office has had success in the past is because of that capacity to let people know that we’re a resource for them,” Tipton said. 
Idaho’s Hispanic population is largely younger than the rest of Idaho’s population, with about 39% of Hispanics under age 20 compared to about a quarter of Idaho’s non-Hispanic residents, according to the commission’s 2024 report. 
“Whether it’s myself, (or) people on the commission — how do we mentor again our young people, our young professionals?” Tipton said. “And polish them, guide them, champion them, and give them those opportunities for them to grow and expand their capacity.”
She also thinks there’s opportunities to weave in best practices she’s learned along the way, like from her experience in investment banking and corporate finance. 
“I learned a lot about why it is those institutions are successful, or they have a bottom line that has proven to be successful,” Tipton said. “And for me, coming into the public sector space, I want to be able to to implement those same types of principles: How do we show our value? How do we show, in numbers, the success — how we’re moving the needle?”

While the legend that Washington had wooden teeth is fake, it is true that by the time our nation’s first president was inaugurated, he only had one real tooth remaining and relied on dentures. Starting in his 20s, he suffered from toothaches and decay due to a combination of disease, diet and genetics.
Just imagine what Washington would think of a nation more than 200 years after his presidency, where the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named community water fluoridation “one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.”
That’s why it’s so alarming that Oklahoma’s own, Gov. Kevin Stitt, has apparently decided to shrug his shoulders at decades of reputable science and instead pander to a vocal minority that seems hellbent on rotting our teeth. Somehow Stitt in his bizarre quest to “Make Oklahoma Healthy Again” seems convinced that our state needs to revert back to the 18th century when Washington lived.  
Perhaps that’s why I found myself gritting my cavity-free and fluoride protected teeth as Stitt announced that thanks to him the state Health Department would no longer recommend the inclusion of fluoride in our public drinking water. This reversal could potentially lead to ill-advised decisions by water districts across our state or politicized fights over community water fluoridation at the local level.
Stitt’s harebrained plan is a clearly ill-educated attempt to pander to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., our nation’s health secretary, who has instructed the CDC to also stop recommending fluoride use in public water. Kennedy can’t outright stop fluoridation, but he can throw around his weight to influence the amount allowed to be added to water supplies. (Much like he has undermined the science of vaccines in our nation.) 
RFK Jr. stood behind Stitt clapping like a happy seal when Stitt announced the fluoridation switcheroo. This was just minutes after the health secretary brazenly called out our state’s 47th worst public health outcomes as several rows of adoring state leaders looked on.
Healthy levels of fluoride are added to about 66% of Americans’ drinking water as a passive way to help reduce cavities and tooth decay.
Up until the mid-1900s, many Americans suffered from debilitating dental issues such as abscesses, dental decay and tooth loss. Researchers discovered that adding appropriate levels of fluoride to water supplies helped preserve dental health with no side effects and that it passively protects people’s teeth even if they don’t brush or floss.
If you want a current example of what happens to dental health when you remove fluoride from public water supplies, you need look no further than Antlers, the county seat of Pushmataha County in southeast Oklahoma.
Antlers is an area that for decades has rebuffed calls to add fluoride to their water, said Dr. Twana Duncan, who for close to 30 years was the county’s only dentist.
Stitt’s abrupt decision to declare war on fluoride treatments left her “heartbroken,” she said, because she sees the resulting health effects on children and adults every day.

Duncan tells me that she has operated on 3-year-olds that needed 14 caps on their teeth, has made dentures as high school graduation presents, and that it’s not unusual to have patients come in with 12 to 20 cavities at a time. 
The technology may be better than during Washington’s days, but the options aren’t.  
The University of Oklahoma graduate acknowledges that some of this may be due to diet, but said she sees a noticeable difference in teeth quality from patients who grew up in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, which have long fluorinated their public water supplies. She can also tell when people have just moved to Pushmataha County because their teeth quality is so much better due to having access to fluoridated water in other communities.
The need for fluoride among Antlers residents is so acute that she encourages patients to swallow small amounts of toothpaste to get their daily dose. If they can afford toothpaste, that is. 
An estimated 1 in 4 residents in Pushmataha County, which has a population just under 11,000, receive food stamps, according to an analysis by the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank. People can’t use their food stamps to buy toothpaste and not all families can afford it. Sometimes patients only get fluoride exposure at Duncan’s practice.
“Oklahoma is going to be a third world country in a few years,” Duncan told me of Stitt’s push.
Oklahoma already has some of the worst dental health outcomes in the nation. The 2023 Oklahoma Health Report Card gave our state a “D” when it comes to 13 “key oral health indicators.”
And it didn’t take me long after having children to discover one reason why. Ours is a state that has embraced policies that make pediatric fluoride treatments insanely expensive.
Oklahoma strangely only requires private dental insurers to pay for one pediatric fluoride treatment a year. Medicaid requires the coverage of one pediatric fluoride treatment every 184 days, so essentially twice each year.
Once a year, I pay over $120 out of pocket — at least $60 per child — to cover the cost of what should be a preventative treatment during my children’s routine biannual dental cleanings.
If Stitt and our lawmakers truly wanted to make Oklahoma healthy, maybe they could start by requiring insurers to cover more preventative dental care.
Imagine that. A small investment that could strengthen overall dental health in the long term.
Duncan said most of her patients turn down fluoride treatments if they have to pay out of pocket for them, but welcome them if they’re free.
But I suspect Stitt — and any lawmakers who support this crazy fearmongering — actually don’t want to make Oklahoma healthy again. They are too focused on MOWA — “Making Oklahoma Worst Again.”
So let’s raise a toast to MOWA – and I’ll take mine with fluoride. After all, our governor has pledged to make Oklahoma top 10 in everything. He’s never said we have to be top 10 best.

(Courtesy photo)An Indianapolis business owner will lead the state’s new Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, with a focus on supporting Hoosiers’ launching the next generation of Main Street businesses. 
Brian Schutt, the co-founder of Refinery46 — a co-working space and startup incubator in Indianapolis — and co-founder of Homesense Heating and Cooling, graduated from Purdue University’s business school in 2003. He said part of the office’s role includes featuring successful, homegrown startups in the Hoosier State.
“The most inspiring thing is to just know somebody else’s story. And I think we have a lot of those,” Schutt told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “A big part of the job is connecting with some of the flourishing businesses that already exist and sharing those stories. Because I don’t think the state can force entrepreneurship — but we can help tell more stories that inspire people to recognize that they have gifts and they can be problem solvers.”

The Indiana General Assembly established the office earlier this year in conjunction with an Indiana Economic Development Corporation transparency effort, explicitly charging the director with “develop(ing) and administer(ing) programs to support the growth of small business, entrepreneurship and innovation.” 
Schutt noted that while starting a business in Indiana is relatively easy in the legal sense, he said he didn’t see the office as prescriptively telling businesses how to flourish, but rather finding “where we can come alongside and where (we can) get out of the way.”
“There’s some programs that already exist that we’re going to analyzing and seeing how they’re working,” said Schutt.
Gov. Mike Braun, who made the announcement Monday morning, has long lauded the office’s anticipated launch, tying it to his own experience as a business owner. 
“(First Lady) Maureen and I lived the American dream of growing Main Street businesses in our hometown, and I want every Hoosier to have that opportunity. Our goal is to make Indiana the best place in the country to start and build your own business, and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation led by Brian Schutt will be a nation-leading resource to help Main Street entrepreneurs,” he said in a release.
The office will report to Secretary of Commerce David Adams, also a Braun appointee. Schutt will also oversee the state’s certified technology parks. 
 The state of entrepreneurship in Indiana

The law creating Schutt’s new role also directs him to identify ways to support rural communities and other underrepresented socioeconomic communities as well as youth entrepreneurship. 
“There is no thriving community without a thriving entrepreneur base,” said Schutt. “… we’re not going to come through with this idea that central Indiana, Indianapolis has all the answers. Really, it has to be a collaborative effort. And a lot of solutions are, necessarily, community led.”

According to the Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship, Indiana lags slightly behind its national peers when it comes to establishing new business opportunities. Though the national rate of new entrepreneurs in 2020 was 0.34% — meaning that 3.4 people out of every 1,000 adults became new entrepreneurs — Indiana’s was only 0.25%.
Additionally, those startups created just 3.5 jobs for every 1,000 people while the national average was five jobs. 
Schutt has considered how to curate the next generation of entrepreneurs before, including a 2022 commentary in the Indianapolis Business Journal on the role of parents, with a goal of helping Hoosier children “see problems as opportunities.”
“If you see problems as opportunities, there’s never going to be a shortage of opportunities,” Schutt said, highlighting Innovate WithIN and High School Hustle programs. “These are programs that already exist that really focus in on that mindset … the capacity to see a problem as an opportunity and not necessarily look around for someone else to be a problem solver.”
In particular, lemonade stands are a longtime favorite for Schutt — though an effort to protect those stands from local interventions has repeatedly failed — and he spent six years as a board member of Lemonade Day in Indianapolis, a program geared toward children, according to his LinkedIn. 
“Lemonade stands are a great foundation. There’s something catalytic when a kid is given the opportunity to create something on their own and earn that first dollar,” said Schutt.

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.



“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

Simple erosion-control technique named after scientist Bill Zeedyk fortifies ecologically valuable riparian zones all around the western U.S.
The post Safeguarding the sagebrush’s rich wet meadows, one Wyoming gulch at a time appeared first on WyoFile .","SOUTH PASS—Tom Christiansen drew a parallel to the human body as he described the purpose of the low-tech rock structures he’s been building for years within the creases of western Wyoming’s sagebrush sea. 
The malady? Erosion. The treatment: A carefully placed stone.  
“Each of these is a stitch on what we don’t want to become a sucking chest wound,” Christiansen told a group of rock-moving volunteers on Saturday in late June. 
The group was assembled on the White Acorn Ranch, a picturesque cattle operation south of the Lander Cutoff Road that’s within the spectacular Golden Triangle — a 367,000-acre region along the flanks of the Wind River Range that houses the best remaining sagebrush habitat on Earth.

The high desert’s sagebrush-steppe has enormous ecological value. That’s evidenced by the struggling species that depend upon the embattled biome. But it’s an arid environment, and certain nooks and crannies play an outsized role in nourishing the landscape’s native and domesticated inhabitants. High on that list are the grassy wet meadows that convey precious water, like arteries pump blood, through the contours of the sagebrush-covered hills.
“These areas are pretty small, but they’re very important,” said Christiansen, a retired sage grouse coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “These are the grocery stores.”

But those bottomlands can become barren of the biomass that feeds insects, sage grouse chicks and on down the food chain. Erosion, although a natural phenomenon, can be hastened by factors like overgrazing and extreme weather events made more likely by climate change. When erosion runs out of control into grassy gulches, they become incised gullies. Out goes the vegetation. 
That’s where the simple rock structures come in.

“Prevent that erosion, get more water into the soil, keep the water table up, keep the green vegetation — that’s the intent of these structures,” Christiansen said. 
Known as Zeedyk structures, after their inventor, Bill Zeedyk, the stone assemblies come in different shapes and sizes. At the White Acorn Ranch and numerous other corners of the West, there are “one rock dams,” “zuni bowls,” “rock mulch rundowns” and other hand-built structures intended to arrest vertical “headcuts” in ephemeral streambeds.
By facilitating the flow of water and slowing it down, the structures can prevent erosion from spreading uphill. Although the ecological do-gooding tactic relies on simple concepts and materials — essentially well-placed rocks — building it out requires hard physical labor.

A bevy of volunteers flocked to South Pass on June 21 to erect new Zeedyk structures and shore up old ones. 
Jared Oakleaf, Liz Lynch and Lindsey Washkoviak ventured up from Lander. Mark Kot, bad back and all, came from Rock Springs to move rock. Christiansen made the drive from Green River alongside his granddaughter, Camryn Christiansen-Fieock, of Big Piney. On a day off, Wyoming Game and Fish Department habitat biologist Troy Fieseler made the trek from Pinedale and with his son, Cooper.

The rocks were donated, too. Robert Taylor, an avid sage grouse hunter from Washington state, ponied up for the materials the volunteers carefully placed. 
Several of the bunch devoting their Saturday to moving rocks up on South Pass were seasoned. Fieseler even learned the ropes from the technique’s namesake himself. 
“The very first time I did it, we had Bill Zeedyk come out,” he said. “He taught us to read the landscape.”

That 2021 workshop, held at Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge, imparted Fieseler with lessons he hasn’t forgotten. Protecting uneroded wet meadows is a far more efficient use of time and resources than trying to restore those that have already washed out, he recalled.
Over the last decade, Zeedyk’s erosion-control tactics have gained traction in Wyoming and well beyond. The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Sage Grouse Initiative gave the concept its legs, Christiansen said. Now there are thousands of structures dispersed across hundreds of projects, he said.
“Each of these, what’s its significance?” Christiansen said. “An individual one, it’s not so much, but when you start doing thousands of these across the West, there is significance.”

Enough time has passed since the technique’s inception that restoration specialists know it works, thanks to long-term monitoring. 
The White Acorn Ranch’s Zeedyk structures also have proven hardy and able to withstand the worst that the harsh Wyoming environment can throw their way. Christiansen and his fellow volunteers labored in a corner of the state that got walloped during the winter of 2022-’23 by an unusually hefty snowpack. 
“This ensured the runoff from the heavy snow,” Christiansen said. “They dealt with a lot of energy, and handled it. Very few rocks moved.”
Christiansen spoke of the rock structure’s resilience on the front end of a day of labor. From a section of state land, he motioned down a draw. 
“There’s over 20 structures between here and where that slope toes off,” he said.

Casper resident’s experience illustrates how the U.S. foster care system doesn’t uniformly screen and treat children who are at risk.
The post Suicide is prevalent among foster youths, yet there’s a systemic failure to address it appeared first on WyoFile .","Elliott Hinkle experienced depression and suicidal thoughts even before entering the foster care system in Casper at age 15. 
At the time, Hinkle struggled with their sexual identity and gender issues, and their difficulties continued in foster care. They felt like they had no one to confide in — not their foster parents, not church leaders, not their caseworker.
“To my knowledge, I don’t remember ever taking a suicide screening,” Hinkle said. “No one ever said: ‘Are you having thoughts of taking your life? Do you feel hopeless?’”
With their psychological and behavioral health needs left unaddressed, Hinkle’s depression and suicidal thoughts worsened.
“Do I stay in the closet and feel terrible and want to end my life?” Hinkle, who is transgender, said. “Or do I come out and lose all my supports, which also feels dangerous?”
Children in foster care are significantly more likely to have mental health issues, researchers say. They attempt or complete suicide at rates three to four times that of youths in the general population, according to several studies.
LGBTQ+ people in foster care, like Hinkle, are at an even higher risk of having suicidal thoughts. 
Yet despite the concentration of young people at risk of serious mental illness and suicide, proactive efforts to screen foster children and get them the treatment they need have been widely absent from the system. And now, efforts underway to provide widespread screening, diagnosis and treatment are threatened by sweeping funding cuts the Trump administration is using to reshape health care programs nationwide. 
In June, federal officials announced they would shut down a suicide hotline serving LGBTQ+ youths as part of those cuts.
Children in foster care use a disproportionate amount of Medicaid-funded mental health services. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s massive budget package, which he signed into law on Friday, contains substantial shifts in Medicaid funding and policies that are projected to drastically reduce services in many states.
“I think anybody who cares about kids’ well-being and mental health is concerned about the possibility of reduced Medicaid funding,” said Cynthia Ewell Foster, a child psychologist and clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan psychiatry department. “The most vulnerable children, including those in foster care, are already having trouble getting the services they need.” 
A lack of federal standards and other system-level issues create barriers to psychological and behavioral care in the child welfare system, said Colleen Katz, a professor at Hunter College’s Silberman School of Social Work in New York.
“When you’re talking about anyone getting screened for suicide ideation upon entrance into the system, it’s inconsistent at best,” she said.  
Katz said all children entering foster care should have a brief, standardized suicide screening embedded into their initial medical assessment. And more screenings need to be conducted throughout a foster care stay, she said, because youths getting ready to transition out of the system are also vulnerable.  
Hinkle, now 31, said the summer before they aged out of the system was “one of the darkest periods, because I was coming to terms with the church not wanting me to be gay and I was about to lose stable housing and whatever foster care support there was.”
Katz studied transition-age youths in foster care in California, which has the highest number of placements in foster care nationwide. According to her analysis, 42% of study participants had thoughts of taking their lives and 24% had attempted suicide, and she expects findings would be similar in other states.
Katz also examined suicide screening tools and found many that already exist could work and be easily administered by trained child welfare workers or alternative frontline service providers, or embedded in existing mental health services.
Still, the quality of services varies by state and locality and can hinder attempts to curb suicides. 
Julie Collins, vice president of practice excellence at the Child Welfare League of America, which advocates for improvements to the child welfare system, said the gap in suicide prevention in foster care mirrors the overall nationwide void of behavioral health services for children and adolescents. “The preparation of people coming into the field isn’t what it needs to be,” Collins said of the lack of training for caseworkers.
Ewell Foster is trying to change that. 
She worked with the state of Michigan to redefine and update the competencies required to earn an undergraduate certificate in child welfare in the state. Eighteen colleges and universities that offer certificate programs in child welfare in Michigan now teach about suicide prevention. 
“It’s something the workforce has asked for,” Ewell Foster said. “They need real clear guidance on what to do when they are worried about someone.”
So far, Ewell Foster’s effort to change the wider system has not run into any roadblocks. Her work with Michigan’s child welfare agency is still being funded under a grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
Agency spokesperson Danielle Bennett said such grants will continue for up to three years. 
However, the future of the federal agency has been in question for months. The Trump administration has laid off hundreds of its employees and has proposed folding its functions into another agency. 
Some states have made changes to address the foster care gaps on their own, but often it has taken legal action to spark changes in suicide prevention efforts.
In Kansas, officials made several changes after the state settled the McIntyre v. Howard class action lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of foster children who, the suit alleged, were subjected to inadequate access to mental health resources and moved from home to home frequently.

April Miller entered the foster care system in Minnesota at age 3 and said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. “The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” she said. (April Miller)
The state increased salaries for social workers in the child welfare system and reduced their caseloads, among other things. 
Other states, including Texas, have implemented similar changes after facing lawsuits.
Still, experts caution that the changes taking place in foster care systems are not enough to steer outcomes. 
Lily Brown, an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, said moving the needle in suicide prevention will require implementing a universal risk assessment for children in state care. 
Brown recently sought a grant to fund and implement free, universal suicide risk screening in foster care throughout Pennsylvania. She had several counties agree to the project, but not enough to support her application — the study wouldn’t have had enough participants to work statistically, she said.
Without such studies, foster care systems nationwide can’t meet the needs of children, she said. 
April Miller, 27, entered the system in Minnesota at age 3. As a Native American, she is part of a group that is overrepresented in foster care. 
“The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” said Miller, who said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. 
“I did a lot of self-harm and had thoughts of suicide but didn’t have access to means, which is why I am still alive,” she said.
Today, Miller is a social worker and suicide prevention coordinator in Bemidji, Minnesota.
Similarly, Hinkle’s experience in the system made them driven to change the trajectory of other young people.
Hinkle provides training, consultation and policy development services at Unicorn Solutions in Oregon in support of youths and young adults affected by systems such as child welfare, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community. 
They said they are committed to making sure that sexual identity and gender topics are not avoided in the system.
“I think every young person should feel loved and cared for,” Hinkle said.

(Jim Peaco/National Park Service)With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the U.S. Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.

The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some National Park Service sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
 National Park Service sites report record number of visitors

Last year was the busiest on record for the park service, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 National Park Service units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the National Park Service charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
 Potential revenue streams to maintain national parks

The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using National Park Service data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries.

The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.
“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

Sen. Lummis would rather serve Trump than her state, endangering those who have risked their lives for this country, writes her former intern Aidan Jacketta.
The post Wyoming politicians have failed to protect veterans appeared first on WyoFile .","During the 2023 fall semester, I interned with U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, not because I agreed with her political stances, but because I wanted to gain experience with federal policy. As a college student in Washington, D.C., but from Wyoming, there weren’t many options for me to work with the politicians who represent my home state. 

Opinion

I felt comfortable working with a lawmaker I don’t entirely politically align with because” hillterns,” the nickname for Capitol Hill interns, are responsible for constituent correspondence, drafting hearing memos and giving tours of the Capitol Building — not supporting or impacting any policy decisions in the office. But as President Donald Trump has taken to his second term, I no longer want to be associated with a politician who is willingly causing so much destruction to my home state. 
Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman all claim to value the lives of Wyomingites who have served this country, but their actions belie that assertion. A simple compare and contrast shows how Wyoming’s federal politicians would do anything to please our fascist president, but nothing to protect Wyoming veterans. 
With veterans being named as a top issue for Lummis, it should come as no surprise that she believes that: 

“The transformation that has occurred at the Veterans Affairs Department in recent years has been essential to improving the quality and timeliness of services and I pledge to hold the department accountable for their actions taking care of the men and women who have given so much to keep us safe.” 

But my problem and disappointment with this is that Lummis is supporting policies that directly harm the Veterans Affairs Department, impacting all Wyoming veterans. Lummis has applauded President Trump, Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency for revealing millions in taxpayer dollars spent on government waste. But what government waste has exactly been cut under the Trump administration? 
Would that be the more than 80,000 employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs?  The VA already had a severe staffing shortage, Military.com reported, but VA Chief of Staff Christopher Syrek wishes to make that worse. This absurd, indiscriminate firing spree is endangering veterans’ access to benefits and care, ranging from disability claims to funeral expense reimbursements. 
With 9.4% of residents being veterans, Wyoming has the second-highest share of veterans in the United States. Cuts to the VA would have a massive and irreparable impact on our state, but our politicians simply do not care. Our senators have made it clear that they do not want to make Wyoming a better state or help support the people who live here, but rather serve a political agenda that benefits them. 
Trump has fired staff supporting the Veterans Crisis Line, a confidential crisis support for veterans and their loved ones, with no regard for the impact it will have on these veterans. As well as VA researchers, staff essential to understanding treatment options for PTSD, opioid addiction, cancer that was caused by veterans’ exposure to toxic chemicals and countless other vital studies have been cut in the name of government waste. 
And what have Wyoming politicians done to oppose these dangerous cuts? Congratulate the man behind these harmful acts as a great leader who is only trying to help this country. Lummis repays the Americans who have served and sacrificed for our freedom by supporting cutting an already understaffed and underfunded government department dedicated to providing physical, mental and financial aid to those who need it. All while celebrating a $45 million parade for the president’s birthday, masquerading as a celebration of the exact military that is being damaged by the administration. 
But I suppose it is my fault for not realizing that Lummis has a long history of harming veterans before I took a job to buff my resume. She voted against the PACT Act of 2022, a bill that would “Provide mental health services, counseling and other forms of medical care through the Department of Veterans Affairs.” With his complete and total endorsement, Trump has bought her allegiance and now she must support his decisions regardless of the negative impacts they will certainly have on Wyoming.
But Lummis is not solely complicit in the harm inflicted on veterans across the state and nation. Barrasso and Hageman have continued to be staunch supporters of an administration that is endangering soldiers and hurting veterans. Just because Wyoming is one of the most conservative states does not mean our politicians should blindly follow every demand of our Republican president. 
Our politicians have continued to show that they serve the agenda of the White House, not the needs of Wyoming. Wyoming veterans deserve better than this. Wyoming deserves better leadership and the people of this state have the power to demand it. 
So demand it, Wyoming.

This week the Department of Corrections will finally take up a 2014 law that aimed to do just that.  | Getty ImagesThe Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) will hold a public hearing this week on Act 196, legislation that received bipartisan support and was signed into law in April 2014 by then-Gov. Scott Walker. The law aimed to create sanctions for people who violate the conditions of their parole, probation and extended supervision as an alternative to revocation, which sends people back to prison sometimes for small infractions that violate the terms of their release. The hearing on implementing a new rule, 11 years after the law was signed, will finally take place on Tuesday, July 8 at 10 a.m.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The public can join the virtual hearing by going to a DOC link and selecting the “hearing information” section. The text of the rule is also available online at the same hearing link.  
Act 196 states the intent to “Develop a system of short-term sanctions for violations of conditions of parole, probation, extended supervision, and deferred prosecution agreement (an agreement not to prosecute pending the accused meeting requirements such as drug treatment).”
A sentence for a criminal violation, besides fines and fees, typically includes a period of incarceration and supervision outside incarceration via parole, probation, or extended supervision.
If a condition of supervision, such as the requirement to remain sober or stay away from minors, is not meant, the probation officer has the option of requesting a revocation hearing before an administrative judge that could result in the person serving a portion or the remainder of the “supervised” sentence behind bars.
Act 196 states “short-term sanctions” should include “examples of high, medium and low level sanctions and what factors to consider when determining which level of sanction to apply.”
The law is not  just punitive. Act 196 also says the DOC is to determine “how to reward offenders for compliance with conditions of parole, of probation, of extended supervision or of the agreement (such as deferred prosecution).”
The 2014 law also states the DOC should “minimize the impact on the offender’s employment” and also minimize “the impact on an offender’s family.”
The 2014 law would appear to meet the stated goals of the DOC and Gov. Tony Evers to lower the revocation rate for Wisconsin that has resulted in thousands returning each year to prison.
WISDOM, a statewide network working on reform of the prison and criminal legal systems and other social justice issues, is pleased the DOC is finally taking steps to implement the 2014 law into a rule.
“A system of short-term sanctions has the potential to significantly reduce the number of people revoked back to prison each year,” said Mark Rice, transformational justice campaign coordinator for WISDOM. “Sending people back to prison for a rule violation, not a conviction of a new crime, is what is fueling the overcrowding of Wisconsin’s prisons, along with the accompanying humanitarian crisis and deaths because of inadequate conditions.”
Tom Gilbert, a father whose son has been incarcerated and had supervision revoked and returned to prison, has led WISDOM’s efforts to get the DOC to implement Act  196.
“It is way past time for Wisconsin to transform its supervision program of people who have been released from their original sentence,” said Gilbert. “Revoking people back to prison for rule violations is counter-productive. Other states have moved to better methods of supervision and are closing prisons.”
But WISDOM officials also have concerns that DOC will use current practices of sanctions, such as 90-day jail confinements, that WISDOM say don’t meet the intent of ACT 196 to “minimize” the impact on employment and the family.
Wisdom officials are also concerned the DOC has not fleshed out how to implement ACT 196 by describing the actual “system of short-term sanctions.” The proposed rule to be considered at the July 8 hearing merely replicates language stated in Act 196 without specifying the actual short-term sanctions or the rewards for meeting the conditions of supervision.
“If the Department of Corrections truly implements both the letter and spirit of Act 196, we see the potential transformation of its community corrections programs to one that focuses on healing individuals and communities affected by crime,” said Gilbert.

Bill Lee recently defended the Tennessee Department of Education's decision to not seek information about whether or not students were enrolled in private schools prior to getting state money for private school vouchers. (Photo: John Partipilo)Responding to criticism about Tennessee’s applications for private-school vouchers, Gov. Bill Lee said this week the state doesn’t need to know whether students were enrolled in private schools before seeking the funds.
Lee told reporters this week the Department of Education created the rules and application based on the bill lawmakers passed this year. The governor’s administration is coming under fire for subsidizing private schools with the $146 million program.
The applications for 20,000 vouchers don’t ask where students previously attended school or were enrolled in a private school. Nor do they request financial information from parents applying for “universal” scholarships, those without income restrictions.
The governor said in a press conference last week the data is not required by the legislation and noted “it’s not necessary to have, particularly because what we hope for is universal school choice, where every family regardless of their child’s past educational history has access to a scholarship.”










The Department of Education and the governor’s refusal to ask for critical data on private and previously participating schools is deeply troubling – especially when other states with similar voucher schemes have faced significant fraud and abuse.


– Rep. Caleb Hemmer, D-Nashville


Families of more than 38,000 students applied for the funds this spring, nearly $7,300 each, to pay for tuition and other private-school costs after lawmakers narrowly passed the voucher program. Those were divided almost evenly between families without income limits and those at 300% of the poverty level with an estimated income of $175,000 for a family of four.
Another 5,000 slots could be offered next year.
Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson, a vocal critic of the program, told the Lookout the legislature should require a state study to determine whether students are using the money to continue attending private schools and where they live so lawmakers can decide if the program should be changed.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville, who is trying to obtain information about the program’s applicants, called it the “educational equivalent of Cash for Clunkers,” a 2009 federal rebate program designed to boost the economy and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars.
In light of Lee’s comments, Hemmer said Tennessee residents “deserve full transparency” when funds are being “diverted” from public schools.
“The Department of Education and the governor’s refusal to ask for critical data on private and previously participating schools is deeply troubling – especially when other states with similar voucher schemes have faced significant fraud and abuse. We can’t afford to blindly walk into a system that lacks oversight and accountability,” Hemmer said in a statement.

Reports on Arizona’s private-school vouchers show the state’s budget ran into problems because funds had to be diverted from other programs to pay for the education program.
The legislature passed Lee’s main initiative even though the state’s own financial impact analysis showed 65% of the students who receive the vouchers would be enrolled in private schools already. Students from private schools surrounded the governor when he signed the bill into law at the State Capitol.
The governor further defended his initiative by saying, “Tennesseans broadly of multiple backgrounds and economic diversity want to have this for their kids.”
Data such as previous enrollment and income level for “universal” scholarships is “not helpful,” Lee said.
The state’s Education Savings Account program for low-income students in Memphis, Nashville and Chattanooga requires applicants to report their household income.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Class dynamics influence the environments in which humans live, yet when this topic arises, it’s almost always framed as a global issue. For example, anthropologist Jason Hickel recently published a now-viral map displaying how, by the year 2070, two billion people will be residing in regions exposed to extreme, potentially unlivable heat.
Approximately 99.7% of those people will be in the Global South, a grouping of poor, formerly colonized nations primarily in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia that are responsible for less than 20% of historical carbon dioxide emissions, meaning the people who have contributed the least to planetary warming will be the ones who suffer the most from it.
Though the United States is a wealthy country firmly entrenched in the Global North, there are rarely discussed yet very similar class dynamics playing out within our nation’s borders, including in Memphis.
What’s happening in Memphis?
Once a green energy advocate, tech billionaire Elon Musk shifted his focus to the artificial intelligence arms race and established “Colossus” in Memphis in 2024. An xAI supercomputer facility designed to power and train Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, Colossus is slated to be the world’s largest supercomputer.
But at what cost? The facility is currently operating 33 methane-powered gas turbines to fuel its AI technology despite holding a permit for only 15. The supercomputer facility is located in a poor, predominantly Black Memphis community with historically high rates of pollution-related illness and disproportionate rates of industrial pollutants.
The magnitude of the energy draw — and resulting pollution — at Colossus is, well, colossal. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), the facility draws enough electricity to power approximately 100,000 homes while consuming 1.5 million gallons of water per day to cool its equipment.
Those inputs are alarming, but the outputs are even worse. The facility’s behemoth methane gas turbines increase Memphis’s smog by 30-60% as they belch planet-warming nitrogen oxides and poisonous formaldehyde around the clock, pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Quoting SELC, “xAI has been operating dozens of unpermitted methane gas turbines without public notice, permits, or air pollution controls. The number of turbines and extent of
  “Colossus,” the Elon Musk supercomputer in Memphis, will use 1.5 million gallons of water per day to cool its equipment. (Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)
It’s worth mentioning that clean air is both a Constitutional right, according to the 9th Amendment, and a human right, as per the United Nations; yet, Memphis leadership has looked the other way as Colossus produces more nitrogen oxides than Shelby County’s Draslovka chemical plant, the Valero refinery, TVA’s Allen power plant, and the Memphis International Airport combined.
South Memphis is becoming a sacrifice zone
“It’s no coincidence that if you are African American in this country, you’re 75% more likely to live near a toxic hazardous waste facility,” said state Rep. Justin J. Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, in a recent interview. “It’s no accident that in this community, we’re four times more likely to have cancer in our bodies. It’s no accident that in this community, there are over 17 Toxics Release Inventory facilities surrounding us — now 18 with Elon Musk’s xAI plant.”
Despite vocal opposition from South Memphis residents and their defenders, these neighborhoods are beginning to look like “sacrifice zones,” or poor, predominantly Black communities that are willfully poisoned and polluted for the interests of power and wealth. 
How long before South Memphis looks like Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, a stretch of communities along the Mississippi River where a slew of dangerous petrochemical facilities have led to the predominantly African American neighborhoods presenting cancer rates at up to 50 times the national average? Or Flint, Michigan, where the preventable 2014 water crisis caused lead contamination that disproportionately affected the region’s mostly low-income population, leading to several deaths and thousands of lifetime disabilities?
The people who contribute the least to environmental harm often suffer the most from it
Although it varies by region, poor Americans produce approximately 10 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. In contrast, wealthy Americans have significantly larger carbon and pollution footprints due to their consumption patterns, investments, and lifestyle. One study found that the wealthiest 10% of Americans account for at least 40% of emissions. 
Yet, despite their disproportionate contribution to the problem, the wealthy can afford to insulate themselves from the harms associated with living on an increasingly warm and polluted planet.
For example, Musk’s private jet flights alone produce approximately 5,497 tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is equivalent to the amount produced by around 550 residents of South Memphis in a year. Every time Musk’s SpaceX launches another rocket (currently about 140 per year), add another 3,189 tons of CO2, or the annual carbon footprint equivalent of 319 South Memphis residents. Musk’s Boring Company, initially pitched as a sustainable alternative to above-ground automobile traffic, is likely to produce tunnels that, car for car, produce eight times more CO2 emissions than roads.
Yet Musk will never have to suffer the environmental harms created by his businesses and lifestyle.
Memphis’s future should be decided by those who live there, not an out-of-state billionaire
Laws like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used to make a not insignificant attempt at insulating poor American communities from the environmental implications of class dynamics, but all of that could change with Supreme Court rulings gutting environmental laws and DOGE-mandated cuts to the EPA.
What’s happening in Memphis is a painful example of America’s shift to a law-of-the-jungle society in which a billionaire can flaunt already gutted and barely enforceable laws and then operate an unpermitted, clandestine, mass-polluting supercomputer facility simply because no one has the resources, power structures, or political will to stop him.
I hope, and still believe, that Tennesseans won’t take that lying down.

The largest tract of public land in the United States is a wild expanse of tundra and wetlands stretching across nearly 23 million acres of northern Alaska. It’s called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, but despite its industrial-sounding name, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, is much more than a fuel depot.
Tens of thousands of caribou feed and breed in this area, which is the size of Maine. Migratory birds flock to its lakes in summer, and fish rely on the many rivers that crisscross the region.
The area is also vital for the health of the planet. However, its future is at risk.
The Trump administration announced a plan on June 17, 2025, to open nearly 82% of this fragile landscape to oil and gas development, including some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. The government accepted public comments on the plan through July 1.
I am an ecologist, and I have been studying sensitive ecosystems and the species that depend on them for over 20 years. Disturbing this landscape and its wildlife could lead to consequences that are difficult – if not impossible – to reverse.
 What is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska?

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was originally designated in 1923 by President Warren Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy.
In the 1970s, its management was transferred to the Department of Interior under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act. This congressional act requires that, in addition to managing the area for energy development, the secretary of the interior must ensure the “maximum protection” of “any significant subsistence, recreational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value.”
The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for overseeing the reserve and identifying and protecting areas with important ecological or cultural values – aptly named “special areas.”
The Trump administration now plans to expand the amount of land available for drilling in the NPR-A from about 11.7 million acres to more than 18.5 million acres – including parts of those “special areas” – as part of its effort to increase U.S. oil drilling and reduce regulations on the industry.
I recently worked with scientists and scholars at The Wilderness Society to write a detailed report outlining many of the ecological and cultural values found across the reserve.
 A refuge for wildlife

The reserve is a sanctuary for many Arctic wildlife, including caribou populations that have experienced sharp global declines in recent years.
The reserve’s open tundra provides critical calving, foraging, migratory and winter habitat for three of the four caribou herds on Alaska’s North Slope. These herds undertake some of the longest overland migrations on Earth. Infrastructure such as roads and industrial activity can disrupt their movement, further harming the populations’ health.
The NPR-A is also globally significant for migratory birds. Situated at the northern end of five major flyways, birds come here from all corners of the Earth, including all 50 states. It hosts some of the highest densities of breeding shorebirds anywhere on the planet.
An estimated 72% of Arctic Coastal Plain shorebirds – over 4.5 million birds – nest in the reserve. This includes the yellow-billed loon, the largest loon species in the world, with most of its U.S. breeding population concentrated in the reserve.
Expanding oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could threaten these birds by disrupting their habitat and adding noise to the landscape.
Many other species also depend on intact ecosystems there.
Polar bears build dens in the area, making it critical for cub survival. Wolverines, which follow caribou herds, also rely on large, connected expanses of undisturbed habitat for their dens and food. Moose browse along the Colville River, the largest river on the North Slope, while peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons and rough-legged hawks nest on the cliffs above.
A large stretch of the Colville River is currently protected as a special area, but the Trump administration’s proposed plan will remove those protections. The Teshekpuk Lake special area, critical habitat for caribou and migrating birds, would also lose protection.
Indigenous communities in the Arctic, particularly the Iñupiat people, also depend on these lands, waters and wildlife for subsistence hunting and fishing. Their livelihoods, food security, cultural identity and spiritual practices are deeply intertwined with the health of this ecosystem.
 Oil and gas drilling’s impact

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is vast, and drilling won’t occur across all of it. But oil and gas operations pose far-reaching risks that extend well beyond the drill sites.
Infrastructure like roads, pipelines, airstrips and gravel pads fragment and degrade the landscape. That can alter water flow and the timing of ice melt. It can also disrupt reproduction and migration routes for wildlife that rely on large, connected habitats.
Networks of winter ice roads and the way exploration equipment compacts the land can delay spring and early summer thawing patterns on the landscape. That can upset the normal pattern of meltwater, making it harder for shore birds to nest.
ConocoPhillips’ Willow drilling project, approved by the Biden administration in 2023 on the eastern side of the reserve, provides some insight into the potential impact: An initial project plan, later scaled back, included up to 575 miles (925 kilometers) of ice roads for construction, an air strip, more than 300 miles (nearly 485 kilometers) of new pipeline, a processing facility, a gravel mine and barge transportation, in addition to five drilling sites.
Many animals will try to steer clear of noise, light and human activity. Roads and industrial operations can force them to alter their behavior, which can affect their health and how well they can reproduce. Research has shown that caribou mothers with new calves avoid infrastructure and that this impact does not lessen over time of exposure.
At Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in the U.S., decades of oil development have led to pollution, including hundreds of oil spills and leaks, and habitat loss, such as flooding and shoreline erosion, extensive permafrost thaw and damage from roads, construction and gravel mining. In short, the footprint of drilling is not confined to isolated locations — it radiates outward, undermining the ecological integrity of the region. Permafrost thaw now even threatens the stability of the oil industry’s own infrastructure.
 Consequences for the climate

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the surrounding Arctic ecosystem also play an outsized role in regulating the global climate.
Vast amounts of climate-warming carbon is currently locked away in the wetlands and permafrost of the tundra, but the Arctic is warming close to three times faster than the global average.
Roads, drilling and development can increase permafrost thaw and cause coastlines to erode, releasing carbon long locked in the soil. In addition, these operations will ultimately add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further warming the planet.
The decisions made today will shape the future of the Arctic – and one of the last wild ecosystems in the United States – for generations to come.

(Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)For two hours every Thursday and Friday, Randall Brown gathers a handful of people in front of a whiteboard. They sit on a couch or armchairs on either side — the walls filled with colorful drawings while coffee brews in a nearby pot. These are Brown’s weekly group therapy sessions.
Everyone is going to speak during Brown’s group today; nobody gets to opt out by saying, “I don’t want to talk.”
Since October 2024, Brown has been working at Lauren’s Wish where he holds these twice-weekly sessions of his Addictive Behavior Awareness (ABA) program for people with substance use disorders. Lauren’s Wish is a nonprofit organization and triage center in Morgantown, West Virginia, helping people with an addiction or in recovery find treatment and connect with necessary resources. 
Brown said that while incarcerated, in 2001, it became clear to him that people experiencing addiction needed guidance in four key areas: manipulation, irresponsibility, a non-caring attitude and self-esteem. So he created the concept for ABA based on his personal experience. 
After his release, Brown decided he wanted to help people with substance use disorders lead a better life, so he trained to be a peer recovery coach and put his plans for ABA into action. 
Today, he sees his mission at Lauren’s Wish as giving people hope. Lauren’s Wish is like a “gateway” for people getting ready to transition into society, Brown says, whether they’re seeking sober living or returning to their families.

“The saying is, in recovery, we keep what we have by giving it away. And I’m always wanting to give it away. I’ll talk to anybody about recovery,” Brown said.
Programs like Lauren’s Wish are typically kept afloat through fundraising and donations; however, they’ve recently received funding from a new source: opioid settlement funds. 
These funds are the result of a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 720,000 people died from an overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2022 
West Virginia will receive about $980 million from the settlement, split into payments over 18 years. The West Virginia First Foundation — a nonprofit created by the state Legislature — will control the spending of 72.5% of the funds, local governments 24.5%, and the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office 3%.  
The state Attorney General’s Office created a Memorandum of Understanding in 2022, under then-Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, that dictates what the funding can be spent on – like increasing access to treatment or prevention-education programs.
How local governments oversee that money, however, including the process through which they take applications, make awards and account for spending, is fully within the control of city and county governments. An investigation into these processes conducted by journalism students at West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media shows the oversight and accountability built into local spending can be markedly inconsistent from county to county — with some doing very little to collect the advice and opinions of addiction experts or people with lived experience.
Detailed reporting, vague decision-making
Lauren’s Wish is an organization almost fully staffed by people in recovery. It has applied for and received opioid settlement funding from both the state and local level, and Brandon Wise, who provides grant writing assistance to nonprofits and wrote both applications for Lauren’s Wish, says the experience at each level is drastically different. 
  Brandon Wise, who writes grants for nonprofit organizations, stands in front of Lauren’s Wish, Morgantown, W.Va. (Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)
According to Wise, the application process for state funding from the West Virginia First Foundation was significantly more involved and lengthy compared to Monongalia County, where Lauren’s Wish is located. He compared the WVFF application to applying for federal grants, noting that it required strict adherence to formatting and content guidelines, specifying what needed to be included without providing a rigid layout. Failure to follow these directions “to a T” could lead to almost immediate rejection.
In Lauren’s Wish’s WVFF application, Wise provided objectives, strategies and a budget narrative with accompanying documents. Wise estimated the application was 50 to 60 pages when finished. 

As of June 6, the WVFF had $19.2 million to award statewide in the four areas outlined by West Virginia’s MOU: diversion programs, youth prevention and workforce development, child advocacy centers/neonatal abstinence syndrome programs, and transitional/recovery housing expansion.
Lauren’s Wish was awarded roughly $168,000 to jumpstart its outreach department by hiring more staff to provide additional aftercare and outpatient services for clients. Their grant period runs from Feb. 1, 2025, through Jan. 31, 2026, and during that time, they will pay for outreach services provided to clients past, present and future, with a focus on individuals dealing with the court system.
Derek Hudson, the founder and executive director of the Neighborhood S.H.O.P. in Charleston, West Virginia’s West Side neighborhood, said it took him almost a week to fill out his WVFF application.
The S.H.O.P. is a basic needs site that offers groceries for people with and without housing, a mini laundromat, showers, a locker program and clothing. These services, located at Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church, are described as no-barrier, allowing people to access what they need at any time.

Hudson described his experience with WVFF as requiring precision, but said some of the process is unclear. In the first round of statewide applications awarded in December 2024, Hudson said his organization was eliminated for not including a page stating “not applicable” where a section did not apply to them, but later resubmitted. 
He applied for $200,000 to fund a re-entry program to house people coming out of incarceration and help them integrate back into society to prevent recidivism and homelessness.
Hudson says he was awarded $80,000 in his second attempt at funding from WVFF and was not provided an explanation as to why he received less than half of what he requested.
According to Hudson, WVFF ​​reporting requirements were “very vague.” For successful applicants, quarterly reports are required to show how the funds are being spent and whether or not they’re completing the objectives set out in their application.
In October 2024, Wise completed and submitted a WVFF application for Jacob’s Ladder as well — a six-month, long-term residential treatment program for men in Aurora, West Virginia — which met the initial requirements and moved into the second evaluation phase. The second phase involved a vote by a five-member board appointed by the governor. The application requested funding for scholarships that would help offset the cost of treatment at the facility not covered by an individual’s insurance. Board members voted against their application.
One settlement, 55 systems
Compared to WVFF’s process, Wise said the Mon County application he completed on behalf of Lauren’s Wish was not as lengthy and more straightforward.
The county uses an online portal with boxes for applicants to fill in the requested specific information. Applicants were required to submit a project summary, proposal details and organization information. For every reimbursement or drawdown, proof of purchase must be submitted and must align with the proposal.
Mon County Commission President Tom Bloom says they largely modeled their application after Kanawha County, the state’s largest county in population and home to its capital city.
In distributing its funding, the Kanawha County Commission has taken some measures to be transparent, posting all applications to their website for the public and other organizations to review.

To date, the county has received a total of $3,905.023.09 in its opioid settlement payments, and so far, has funded eight organizations for $1,088,208. The Neighborhood S.H.O.P. requested $49,500 to help establish a new staff position but was denied funding on Oct. 1, 2024.
Applications in Kanawha County are accepted on a rolling basis. Every expenditure and funding request is voted on by the three elected commissioners in a public meeting that allows for community input.
The commission did not sponsor community conversations to discuss the funds, but community groups in Charleston did hold town halls, bringing various groups together to discuss the distribution of opioid dollars and communicate those recommendations to county officials. At the Kanawha County Public Library, about 60 people attended one of these town halls in March.
Kanawha County Commissioner Lance Wheeler said the commission avoided funding new organizations or those without a “proven track-record.”
When asked if the Kanawha commissioners consulted experts in the field before making final funding decisions or if they made the decisions based on their own experience, Wheeler said it was a combination of both.

He said they have relationships with the local Kanawha-Charleston Health Department and Recovery Point Health, whom they provided funding to from the county budget, and also have experience in responding to funding requests.
In Monongalia County, the application, which is based on a general format and questions used by Kanawha County, asked organizations to provide an executive summary of their proposal, its details, budgeting and organization information, including current funding sources. The majority of questions have a 10,000-character answer limit.
Where Wise at Lauren’s Wish said his WVFF application was 50-60 pages, his final application for Monongalia County amounted to seven pages, plus additional tax and financial documents.
As of May 1, Monongalia County has received $1,221,683.89. According to meeting minutes from July 2024, the commission had been working to create a process to award opioid settlement funds for months, but has chosen not to hold public forums to gain community insight into the need, like some counties did.
Bloom said commissioners did not consult experts in evidence-based treatment during the application creation, review or awarding process, but rather relied on their own experience and research.
On July 31, 2024, the three-person Monongalia County Commission approved 12 of 17 applications for a total of $576,900, according to Bloom. Before funding organizations at the July meeting, he said he and the other two commissioners spent close to 30 hours reviewing the “huge” applications.
Lauren’s Wish was awarded $37,500 that day to fully integrate Brown’s ABA program into its peer recovery support services.
Mon County commissioners say they focused on selecting specific, established programs that could further provide their services to the community while also looking for new approaches that could assist people with opioid use disorders, with “the key being that we didn’t want to duplicate the services that are out there,” according to Bloom.

Bloom was a guidance counselor for 34 years and has been a county commissioner since 2013, and with some additional research, said he felt confident in the commission making funding decisions.
While county commissioners are not required to have expertise in substance use disorders or follow a specific application, review, or awarding process, Laura Lander, addiction therapist and associate professor at West Virginia University’s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, said this thinking confused her.
“That’s great that they have experience writing grants, but it’s who gets the grant or what are you targeting the grant towards that is of concern,” she said.
When asked about the accountability of county commissions distributing the funds, Wise said, “I would say the county does their due diligence.”
But without input from external sources and stakeholders, Lander said funding awards are subject to a commissioner’s individual bias.
 “Clearly, in other counties, based on what I’ve seen, the money used for law enforcement has the county commissioner’s ear, and we see lots of money going towards police vehicles,” she said.
Although she was not familiar with one of the 12 applications approved by the commission, Libera Inc., Lander said that Monongalia County’s awardees are “great allocations” of the funds and are directly involved with substance use disorder treatment and advocacy.
One county tries a more inclusive approach
In contrast to many counties in the state, the Preston County Commission seems to be taking a more deliberate approach to its spending. As of June 6, the county has received $803,603.42 of settlement funds as part of the local share and decided to put this money into a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) to earn interest.
This decision was influenced by the model adopted by Raleigh County, which invested its initial funds while conducting a year of planning, Preston County Commissioner Nathan Raybeck said.
Because they felt they “didn’t know enough about the issue to make a decision” themselves, especially given that “everybody under the sun is going to want a little piece of a little something,” the Preston County Commission created its own Opioid Settlement Advisory Board, Raybeck explained.
“We got a board together of the people who are most directly affected by it, the people who see this day in and day out,” Raybeck said.
The board is composed of individuals selected from the general public who have lived experience with opioid use disorder and representatives from offices such as community corrections, probation and the sheriff’s department. Currently, the board is identifying the best uses for the funds, focusing primarily on improving access to treatment and long-term prevention while researching how to tailor solutions to the specific causes and barriers.
The board’s main focus is treatment and prevention, said Dr. Lola Burke, prescribing provider and medical director for the Preston Recovery Care Program in Kingwood, who serves on the board.
“This is our chance to actually come up with some long-term solutions for this problem that has been plaguing us for a couple of decades now,” Burke said.
Raybeck said it was important not to spread the money too thin, “Because giving you $13,000, and you $30,000, and you $40,000 ain’t gonna get us anywhere.”
Absent oversight, future spending could face accountability gaps
On May 20, in Sutton, West Virginia, WVFF celebrated its first grant recipients, with a total of $17 million awarded to 94 organizations. 
Although the timeline for the next grant application cycle has not yet been determined, organizations like Lauren’s Wish and the Neighborhood S.H.O.P. will be eligible to apply for a second round of funding. Applicants who were denied, like Jacob’s Ladder, are also able to reapply.
At the local level, county commissions are left to their own timelines and decision-making processes. Some, like Preston County, are only beginning to create these procedures, while others, like Monongalia and Kanawha counties will have another go after learning from their first rounds.
Although Lauren’s Wish was awarded funds at both the state and county levels, Monongalia County Commission President Bloom questions if the WVFF’s state-chosen reviewers truly know enough about local programs to make informed decisions.
There are regional boards that also make recommendations to the state WVFF reviewers during the selection process, but Bloom said regional boards are still “not local.” 
Each of the six regional panels were initially supposed to be made up of two individuals from each county, but WVFF “changed the rules” during the process, according to Bloom, and now are made up of six individuals who each represent six categories of interest, like treatment and prevention.

Bloom said a lack of oversight and direction from WVFF was also an issue, but understands that this was its first attempt at the process.
While a chunk of settlement money has been spent, this only marks the start of a statewide effort to leverage these funds for change in West Virginia. Lander hopes to see this money go into not only existing programs, but new ones as well.
“So many of the grants that were funded were just funneling money into existing programs, which is not without merit. That can be very valuable,” Lander said. “But I wish we would really think about the big picture and how to build affordable housing infrastructure in this state, because it is hard to get sober if you do not have a place to live.”
She said more representation from various stakeholders who are impacted and understand the effect of substance use disorders on the community could make a significant difference.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement June 30.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota)New budgets for state agencies and commissions in North Dakota went into effect July 1 and one commission will see a 20% increase over the next two years — the Commission on Legal Counsel for Indigents.
The commission has a budget of nearly $27.2 million through the 2025-27 biennium, a $4.5 million budget increase over its 2023 budget.
Travis Finck, executive director for the commission, said the budget increase is a step in the right direction on fair pay for attorneys that assist defendants who can’t afford to pay for a lawyer.
“We’re still not where we need to be, but we also understand the position the state is in. There was a lot of uncertainty with federal funds and obviously property tax was a big issue this session,” Finck said. “We’re really grateful to legislators … They were listening and understanding of our situation that we’re in and did commit to helping support us and our mission moving forward.”
The commission’s public defenders are set to begin a new tiered pay scale and defense attorney contractors will see a pay raise this year, but they will still earn less than prosecutors and attorneys working for other state agencies. Finck said the defense attorney contract rate for indigent defense increased on July 1 from $80 to $90 per hour because of the increased budget.
“That’s still a good increase for us, but we’re still significantly behind what the federal rate is,” he said. As of Jan. 1, the defense attorney contract rate for federal, non-capital cases is $175 per hour, according to the U.S. Courts website.
“We just want to be in the same ballpark because we think we offer an opportunity where if you go to law school and you want to make a difference in someone’s life, we provide that opportunity,” Finck said. “The problem is, before, we weren’t even in the stadium. So at least now, we’re getting a lot closer.”
Public defenders underpaid, overworked, North Dakota report says

The increased budget will also allow the commission to hire two additional investigators, bringing the total number of investigators to three, to help with the defense of their clients. Finck said, if prosecutors need more information about a case, they can send out a sheriff’s deputy or a police detective and they can go out to interview more witnesses, or gather more evidence.
“On the defense side, if we have an issue pop up … a lot of the time, unfortunately, that’s my attorneys out there taking those pictures or trying to track down witnesses,” Finck said. “With the use of investigators now, we can have people who are trained specifically in investigations to go out and interview witnesses … and a lot of the time it’s verifying our client’s story.”
Aaron Birst, executive director for the North Dakota Association of Counties and a former prosecutor, said adding two additional investigators to be used by public defenders will help ensure the correct outcomes occur in these cases.
“Law enforcement and prosecutors are also overworked and any time you have another set of eyes looking at something, that’s helpful to the system and not just to the defendants,” Birst said.
During the legislative session, Finck told lawmakers that employee turnover has been a problem for their offices in recent years. He said the six largest counties in North Dakota allocated about $39 million to prosecutors during the previous biennium while the commission’s budget for the whole state was $22.6 million.
The commission has an administrative office in Jamestown and regional public defender offices in Fargo, Bismarck-Mandan, Grand Forks, Minot, Dickinson and Williston. 
Finck said it will be interesting to see how the counties respond to the 3% property tax levy caps that passed as part of property tax reforms as it relates to prosecutor pay in the future.
During the 2023-25 biennium, 18 of the commission’s 41 total employees left their positions, including 10 attorneys, which led to cases being reassigned to an already stretched public defender workforce or contracting services to private defense attorneys. Those reassigned cases are typically paid at a higher rate than normal, Finck said.
North Dakota laws address avoiding criminal charges, improving life after jail

In fiscal year 2024, the commission handled 16,671 court cases, a new record for public defenders in the state, and an increase of more than 400 cases from the previous year. The commission has seen more than 16,100 cases each year since 2021. According to the 2024 North Dakota Court System annual report, more than 168,000 cases were filed in district court last year, which includes both civil and criminal cases.
State law requires the commission to contract out at least 50% of its cases to private defense attorneys. Finck told lawmakers that 73% of its cases were contracted to defense attorneys outside of the commission public defenders in 2024.
Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, an attorney, sponsored and passed a series of criminal justice reform measures during the legislative session aimed at improving the state’s judicial system, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. One of the new laws eliminated the $35 application fee for indigent defense and instead replaced the revenue from those fees with an allocation from the state’s general fund.
Klemin praised Finck for the job he is doing running the commission with its high case load. He also said the way to prevent the turnover of public defenders is obvious.
“Pay them more money and they’ll stay. It is that simple,” Klemin said. “We have a constitutional obligation to provide a defense for somebody who is alleged to have committed a crime, if they can’t afford an attorney.”
He added the budget increase will help the commission and its public defenders, but there is still plenty of room to keep going.
“It’s going to help, but it’s still not enough,” he said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is collecting signatures for its proposed ballot measure slowly and deliberately as the group navigates lawsuits and new requirements for gathering petitions. 
The nonpartisan, grassroots organization and its ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, is collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment aimed at protecting Arkansans’ right to direct democracy and preventing legislative interference in this process, which allows people to propose laws and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
After the attorney general certified the ballot measure in late May, Michelle Wolchok, president of the League of Women Voters of Washington County and a member of Save AR Democracy, said the group had to wait a few weeks to begin collecting signatures because the state hadn’t yet written directions for how to comply with about a dozen new state laws affecting the initiative process.
New requirements include requesting a photo ID from potential signees, informing them petition fraud is a criminal offense and having them read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them. Proponents said the laws will protect the integrity of the process, while opponents argued they’ll make it nearly impossible for Arkansans’ proposals to qualify for the ballot. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas officially kicked off its petition gathering campaign in mid-June, and Wolchock said the new laws have presented some issues. While canvassing, Wolchock said she’s lost some signatures because people didn’t have a photo ID with them. She’s also concerned about the time it takes to comply with the new laws.
“It is a harder ask to ask people of their time if they’re running into the grocery store or they’re in line to go see a concert at the AMP, to take up that little bit of extra time with them, it just takes longer to get each signature,” she said.

At this time, canvassers are all volunteers and the League has been focused on scheduling training so people can begin collecting signatures. During the Northwest Arkansas Pride festival in late June, five volunteers collected nearly 600 signatures in 10 hours. 
While Wolchock is excited by this initial support, she said she’s also feeling daunted because it’s just “a drop in the bucket” of the nearly 91,000 signatures that need to be collected from 50 counties to qualify for the 2026 ballot. 
The League collected a few more signatures Wednesday night at a meeting of the Washington County chapter. Members packed the patio at Crisis Brewery in south Fayetteville to learn more about upcoming training and canvassing events.
They also heard from guest speaker Bill Kopsky, executive director of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, which has proposed its own direct democracy ballot measure that has yet to advance to the signature-gathering phase. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin last week rejected the group’s measure for a second time for failing to meet a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. Kopsky said Protect AR Rights is working on revisions and intends to resubmit its proposal soon. 
While Protect AR Rights and Save AR Democracy share the goal of protecting the initiative and referendum process in Arkansas, the language of their proposals differ in some respects and only the League’s has been certified by the attorney general. 
Kopsky told the crowd one of the biggest differences between the two measures is his group’s proposal would require the state to notify voters if their signature is rejected and give them 10 days to correct any problems. Ballot measure sponsors would also be given time to correct errors, he said. 
Members of both groups acknowledged Wednesday that their greatest chance of achieving their shared goal is by working together and said they plan to meet in the coming weeks to discuss what that might look like. 
“Our ultimate goal is to protect the process for citizens, and we’re going to ultimately do what’s in the best interest of that,” Kopsky said in an interview. “I think ultimately we’re all going to have to consolidate around one. What that is, I think it’s too early to say.”

In hopes of qualifying for the 2026 ballot, Wolchock said the League is pursuing a multipronged approach. The group filed a lawsuit in April challenging several of the new direct democracy-related laws. 
Protect AR Rights filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit in May so they can challenge additional laws. If a judge denies the motion, Kopsky said they’ll file a separate lawsuit. Both groups are hoping a judge will block the new laws so they can collect signatures under previous rules.
The League is also awaiting a ruling in a separate case over a 2023 law that increased the threshold for gathering signatures from 15 counties to 50. The attorney general’s office filed a letter with the court Wednesday requesting a hearing with the new judge that’s been assigned to the case. 
Meanwhile, members of the League of Women Voters like Wendy Finn are eager to support the democratic process by engaging in the organization’s initiatives. Finn, a board member of the League’s Washington County chapter, said she joined the organization two years ago because she was “really ticked off” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Joining the League and participating in its efforts is a great way “to channel anger and frustration with systems that are not functioning for us into positive civic action,” she said.   
“You can rage in the streets all you want to, and we should rage in the streets if you’re upset about what your government’s doing,” Finn said. “It’s one of our freedoms that we have and we should exercise that, but the real work, the day-to-day work of democracy happens at the League.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
House, Senate push along bills to attract nuclear developments to Indiana

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
Lawmakers passed legislation easing the path to nuclear and Gov. Mike Braun has indicated his strong support.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Amanda Berg for the Capital-Star)Public school districts across Pennsylvania faced a deadline of June 30 to approve a budget for the coming fiscal year. Many balanced their budgets, banking on the legislature’s approval of a proposal that would save their districts more than $600 million in cyber charter school tuition.
But if the legislation to cap taxpayer-funded tuition for online charter schools doesn’t become part of the next state budget, it would send some districts, such as Delaware County’s William Penn School District, scrambling to close million dollar gaps in their spending plans.
William Penn and about 370 of the commonwealth’s other districts are also counting on the second installment of $526 million to correct the unconstitutional disparity in state funding between the wealthiest and poorest districts.
“Both of those items are factored into the budget, and those items are allowing us to balance our budget,” William Penn Superintendent Eric Becoats told the Capital-Star. “If the state does not pass those items or approve those items as they are, we are really going to have to go back to the drawing board and begin to look at art, music, athletics, as well as transportation.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
William Penn passed a $134.6 million budget last week that includes a 3.9% increase. That’s equivalent to about $185 a year for the owner of a property assessed at $150,000. The district’s tax rate of $32.86 per $1,000 of assessed value already ranks among the highest in Delaware County. 
“The proposal is asking the community to do everything that we can ask them to do,” Becoats said.
Without a cap on cyber tuition, William Penn would need to plug a $2 million gap in its budget.
This situation is not unique. The School District of Lancaster’s board passed a 4.25% tax increase. That means another $172 a year for an owner of property assessed at the district’s median of $166,000.
“That’s a savings that would be passed along to our taxpayers,” School Director Dave Parry said.
Like William Penn, Lancaster balanced its budget, in part, by holding off on hiring for new positions or allowing jobs to stay open through attrition.
It’s unclear how many of the state’s 500 school districts approved a tax increase or included projected cyber charter reform savings in their budgets this year. The Pennsylvania Department of Education does not post aggregated school district budget data until later in the year.
State lawmakers have been unusually tightlipped about budget negotiations this spring, as Senate Republicans have sparred internally over new revenue sources and face pressure to compromise with the Democratic-controlled House and Gov. Josh Shapiro to provide more money for struggling transit agencies.
The General Assembly recessed for the July 4 holiday after missing its June 30 budget deadline and the Senate has no session days on its calendar until September.

Last month, the House passed a bill to cap cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student next year. It would also establish a statewide formula for special education tuition. That would save public school districts across the commonwealth an estimated $616 million a year, according to a House analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact.
The Senate has not acted on the measure, but Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) has said criticisms of cyber charter schools, such as lack of oversight and transparency, have merit. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said last week he believes there’s a “good chance” that it will be part of the final budget package.
Lancaster and William Penn were among six school districts in a historic lawsuit against the state. It culminated with a 2023 Commonwealth Court decision declaring the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund public education unconstitutional.
They argued the state had failed for decades to account for the disadvantages dealt to students in impoverished school districts. 
School leaders in cities such as Johnstown, Lancaster and Wilkes-Barre, and rural districts like Shenandoah Valley and Panther Valley in the state’s coal region, have struggled to generate sufficient tax revenue by levying higher rates on less valuable property. Wealthier districts, such as Lower Merion in Montgomery County and Fox Chapel in Allegheny County, achieved per-pupil spending among the highest in the state with similar or lower tax rates.
After the Commonwealth Court decision, the legislature and the Shapiro administration convened the bipartisan Basic Education Funding Commission to assess the level of need across the state. It determined the gap between districts with adequate funding that achieved the state’s educational assessment goals and those that did not was $4.5 billion. And the legislature resolved to pay that out over nine years.
Last year, the state budget provided $526 million, or about 11% of the total, as the first installment of adequacy funding to be distributed through a new fair funding formula. That was on top of another $574 million increase in education funding distributed to all districts.
But Pennsylvania school districts pay about $1 billion a year in cyber charter school tuition calculated through a formula that critics allege doesn’t reflect the actual costs of providing an exclusively online education.
In a report earlier this year, Republican Auditor General Timothy DeFoor’s office found the money paid to cyber charter schools resulted in five of the largest accruing excessive surpluses. It also noted “uncommon” spending for taxpayer funded schools. Examples include $22 million in employee bonuses, $2.4 million in fuel stipends, $1.3 million for a vehicle fleet and $70,280 for a “Family Funfest Event.”
The cyber charter schools examined in the audit responded by pointing out that DeFoor’s office found no financial mismanagement, waste, fraud, or abuse of taxpayer dollars.
Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters PA, said cyber charter tuition eats into the gains that school districts could achieve through adequacy funding. She added that the state’s increases in basic education and special education funding have barely kept pace with inflation.
“If the legislature punts on cyber charter funding reform without increasing basic and special education funding they’re going to really harm a lot of students and a lot of districts,” Spicka said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230530_Cap_Star_Edu_Funding_643_EDIT-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 06:03:29.050707

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)BOWLING GREEN — When the Family Enrichment Center was established in 1977 with the goal of addressing child abuse, staff immediately set aside an open — free — seat for a child in need. 
Despite tumultuous challenges facing the child-care industry, that seat stays open thanks to grant funding. Staff say it’s a key tool in fighting child abuse in Warren County, where around 20% of children live in poverty and food-insecure homes, according to the 2024 KIDS COUNT County Data Book. 
Thanks to the program, if Bowling Green parents can’t care for their child — because of a job interview, doctor’s appointment, court appearance or the need for a self-care day — and have nowhere safe to leave their child, they can bring that kid to the Family Enrichment Center’s crisis drop-off for free, explained Nickie Jones, the executive director. 
“The very first program we did was the crisis drop-off center,” Jones said. “The group of people here in our area wanted to do something to address child abuse, and they were smart enough to realize that a crisis unit or crisis drop-off or drop-in service was a need to support families.”

The program is open to children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old — “because they are most at risk from dying from child abuse,” Jones explained. 
Usually, children who come to the center through the crisis drop-off are a year old, said Jennie Watt, the director of the Wee Care child care branch of the center. 
“Most abuse — it happens at home,” and the center’s staff is deeply aware of that reality, said Watt. Sometimes, parents and guardians just need a mental health break, she said. 
The crisis drop-off children spend their day in a play-based classroom with other toddlers and get a breakfast snack and a free lunch, which includes a protein, vegetable, fruit, grain and dairy.  
“We just try to be a safe place,” Jones said. “We’re just unique. Nobody else around here does this.”  
‘Vital to our community’

In 2024 Kentucky’s child care industry — which some would like to rebrand as “early childhood education” — lost COVID-19 relief dollars that helped stabilize the industry during the last few years. This left many centers to cut pay for their workers, raise tuition for parents, cut services and even close, the Lantern has reported. 
As fewer child care centers operate and prices for quality care increase in a state with high rates of child abuse, experts said having quality, affordable — which sometimes means free — child care has never been more important. 
Jennifer Bailey, the director of development and marketing at St. Teresa Ministries in Bowling Green, which supports the Family Enrichment Center with a $20,000 grant, said the crisis drop-off program is “vital to our community.” 
“Oftentimes, parents have to choose who to leave their children with to go to a job interview or go to work or go to a class,” Bailey said. “And sometimes it’s not always the best decision, and sometimes it can be that they are left alone at a young age.” 
Kosair for Kids, a Louisville-based organization that advocates for children’s wellbeing, also helps fund the program with a $50,000 grant. 
“What we don’t want is — we don’t want that 4-year-old to be left at home with their 8-year-old older sibling,” said Barry Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids. “That’s child neglect, and it’s not that there are bad people out there in those kinds of instances who necessarily want to do that, they just don’t have anywhere else to turn.” 
In addition to the crisis drop-off program, the Family Enrichment Center provides parenting classes and supervised visitations. The center also partners with senior volunteers through The Foster Grandparents Program, in which people 55 and older work with children in classrooms on counting and  other intellectual skills. 
One such volunteer, Faye McKeage, works with pre-K children and is assigned to help two students with reading and counting. 
“I want them to grow up to be responsible adults and if I could put a little love in their heart for them to love others, that’s what gives me joy,” she said. “They’re precious.”

‘Human capital’  
Jones and the staff at Wee Care always aim to transition their crisis drop-off kids — who are limited to 30 crisis drop-off days per year and 10 hours per week — into full-time care at the center. 
They also know that expense is often a barrier for families. 
On average, child care in Kentucky costs $8,756 a year, or $730 per month, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute. 
“I definitely think that the state needs to fund and help support child care, not only for low-income but middle-income families as well,” said Bailey with St. Theresa’s. “Maybe the state could help in and start off setting some of the cost of the overhead. And you need to pay your workers a good wage. There’s always room for improvement that the state can do to help with child care.” 
Kentucky’s Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) also offers assistance to eligible families. In 2023, about 35,000 children attended a child care program thanks to CCAP, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. That accounted for about 21% of the state’s child care spots. 
Kentucky also needs “preschool for everyone,” Bailey said. In June, Gov. Andy Beshear signed an executive order that established an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
“Preschool for everyone, definitely at age 4, would be a win-win” Bailey said. “Really, you’re getting those kids in there and getting them ready and prepared for school, where some daycares don’t do that.” 
Child advocates said that while the two-year budget approved by the General Assembly in 2024 included valuable investments in child care, it was not enough to stabilize the industry. In 2026, lawmakers will pass a new budget. 
“Lawmakers sometimes may not see that those early years are the most instrumental for kids,” Jones said. 
  Nickie Jones poses for a photo at the Family Enrichment Center in Bowling Green, June 16, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)
Because of that, she said, “the babies have to be seen as human capital.” 
“This is an economic issue,” she said. “Who’s going to be the one that gives the life saving surgery? Who’s going to do that? These kids. They have to have the very best start in life — quality care, quality programming.” 
Watt said there are lots of ways to improve and support the industry, starting with public perception.
“This isn’t just coming in and playing with kids all day,” she said. “You’re coming in here and you’re teaching them, and you’re teaching them how to engage, and the language that you use is important.” 
Jones agreed, saying the state’s focus on economic development must also include child care. 
“Can we tout that we have really good early childhood programming in our area to draw people here? They think about jobs. Who’s going to work those jobs if they don’t have child care?” she said. 
There’s a “growing need for child care,” Jones said, and centers will have to adjust to meet those needs. 
But she’s determined to keep one seat in every classroom open for a child in need. So far, she hasn’t had to turn away paying clients in favor of the program. 
“Not only do we want to help keep the room open, but we’ve also tried to raise quality,” Jones said of the drop-off program. “It’s still something I see very important.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Dan McKee vetoed legislation that would have offered credit for the time still remaining after a vehicle registration is canceled. (Getty image)Of the 513 bills the General Assembly sent to Gov. Dan McKee this year, only two pairs have been blocked at the governor’s desk — both aimed at giving Rhode Island drivers partial credits for fees on canceled vehicle registrations.
McKee vetoed the two sets of bills opposed by the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on Wednesday, July 2, when his office announced his final decisions on legislation from this year’s session, which ended June 21.
The legislation sponsored by Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Providence Democrat, and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat, would have allowed drivers who cancel their vehicle registration before its expiration date to receive a credit for the unused portion of the fee they paid to the DMV. That credit could have been used toward future registration fees.
The registration period for renewals of motorcycles, passenger vehicles and camper RVs is two years. Fees are based on vehicle weight.
In letters to legislative leaders, McKee wrote the bills would “impose significant implementation burdens on the DMV” and could have negative fiscal impacts under the language approved by lawmakers.
Indeed, the DMV in its written testimony to lawmakers stated that the state would have lost between $1.3 million and $1.6 million based on registration cancellations in 2023 and 2024.
“Because the fees for many vehicles are more than $60, the actual amount of lost revenue could be much higher,” Walter “Bud” Craddock, the administrator of the Rhode Island DMV, wrote to the House Committee on Finance May 6.
McKee voiced concerns about provisions in one of the bill sets that would have allowed 36-month vehicle leases to renew for a third year to align with the end of the lease.
He wrote that the DMV does not track the terms of any leased vehicles because dealers and motorists are not required to submit a copy of their lease agreement at the time of initial registration.
“As a result, it would be impossible for the DMV to know the lease term at the time of renewal since most registrations are renewed online or through mail,” McKee wrote.
The governor can choose to sign a bill as a form of explicit endorsement, veto it, or can simply allow the bill to become law without a signature. 
Vetoed bills return to the chamber where they originated and the Rhode Island Constitution allows the General Assembly to override the governor’s decision if three-fifths of members in each chamber votes to affirm the bill’s passage. That vote would need to take place before the start of the new law making session in January. 
McKee’s veto messages are being reviewed by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and President Valararie Lawson, their respective spokespeople said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
In 2024, McKee vetoed five sets of bills. The governor does not intend to strike down any other pieces of legislation this year, McKee spokesperson Andrea Palagi said in a text message.
“There aren’t any [bills] left — desk is cleared,” she wrote.

Kentucky Lantern first reported in early 2023 that the state Republican Party had launched the fundraising drive to expand its headquarters in Frankfort — a drive that got off to a spectacular start with a donation of $1 million from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer —apparently the largest donation ever made to a political party in Kentucky history.
State and federal laws limit the amount any person can give to a state political party to $15,000 per year. And before 2017 state law banned corporations from making contributions.
But that year the Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to make it easy for the GOP to raise the millions it would need to build a new headquarters. That law let political parties establish separate building funds that could accept donations of unlimited amounts from corporations or people.
The Republican Party of Kentucky (RPK) has its headquarters in south Frankfort, about five blocks from the Capitol. It is called the Mitch McConnell Building in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with leading the party from decades of minority status to its current dominance in Kentucky politics.
The expansion project calls for connecting the headquarters to a new 6,800-square-foot structure on an adjacent vacant lot, designed to conform to the residential nature of the neighborhood. The new building includes a 160-seat auditorium.
Ground was broken for the project last summer, construction has moved at a fast pace.
“We expect the building to be completed sometime this fall. We’re very excited about the construction wrapping up. It will be great to finally use the new space,” Andy Westberry, spokesman for the RPK, said in response to an email asking questions about the project. “We’ll continue fundraising as well. Like with any facility, there will be ongoing costs for upkeep and maintenance.”
Westberry did not address an emailed question seeking comment on the funding of the project by special interest donors. 
Reports filed by the RPK Building Fund since early 2023 with the election registry show that a total of $4,022,500 has been raised for the project since late 2022, and that through June 30 about $2.7 million has been spent.
Those reports show nearly all of that has been paid to three contractors: $2,273,000 to Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs; $244,000 to Stengel-Hill Architecture, of Louisville, and $165,000 to Haney Consulting for fundraising consulting. Haney Consulting is headed by Laura Haney, McConnell’s longtime fundraising consultant.
The Kentucky Democratic Party has not used the 2017 law to launch any major fund drive. In the recent quarter it reported $142 in receipts, $20,613 in expenses, and a fund balance of $286,497 as of June 30.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Growing up on the northside of Denver, I was surrounded by a diverse community with a rich history. There, I learned about resilience, about neighbors looking out for each other, and about the importance of always standing up for what’s right. This lesson has guided my 20 years of progressive activism throughout Colorado, from my work to protect reproductive rights to my work to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all Coloradans. 
As someone who fights for a fairer and just society, I paid attention when big box retailers began speaking the language of diversity and equity several years ago. Companies like Walmart, Target and Home Depot positioned themselves as allies of marginalized communities. The stores launched supplier diversity programs, implemented DEI training, and claimed to share our values of inclusion and justice. Walmart even founded its nonprofit to advance racial justice. Corporate America finally understood that it also had a role to play in helping us build stronger, more inclusive communities. 
However, my years in progressive organizing have also taught me an important lesson: Watch what someone does, not just what they say.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When Donald Trump returned to the White House and demanded an end to diversity initiatives, the big retailers bent the knee. Walmart stopped funding its racial justice nonprofit. Target abandoned its supplier diversity program, taking away opportunities from minority businesses that are often overlooked. Even Home Depot dropped mentions of diversity from its website and its annual report to investors. As a result of the anti-diversity push, events like Denver Pride have lost significant funding this year. 
The retailers betrayed our communities, hoping we wouldn’t notice, but we did. That’s why the Rocky Mountain NAACP encouraged shoppers in our state to take their business to the retailers who refused to cave on diversity issues, and consumers all over the nation launched boycotts of Walmart and Target.
What makes it worse is that in many marginalized and rural communities, big box stores are often the only place to shop. People rely on them for everyday essentials. When these companies cut diversity programs or raise prices, it harms those who need them most. It shouldn’t be too much to ask these companies to consider their customers. 
Diversity isn’t the only issue where the retailers are failing us, though. Every Coloradan has seen the cost of groceries skyrocket. As of 2023, Coloradans pay 19% more than the national average for groceries. Why? During COVID, it was because some retailers took advantage of supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic to jack up prices on consumers. A Federal Trade Commission report last year found that food and beverage retailer revenues increased more than 7% over total costs in the first three quarters of 2023. A senior executive at a major grocery chain even admitted that the store raised prices on basic necessities beyond what was necessary.
This summer, Trump’s tariffs are giving the stores an excuse to play the same pricing tricks. Many believe the stores will use the economic chaos caused by tariffs as cover for yet another chance to pad their bottom lines at our expense. It may have already started. Walmart and Target have announced price increases to varying degrees, even as tariffs have been removed or paused.  
Also troubling, the stores have new technology that they can deploy to trick consumers. Across the nation, Walmart, Kroger, and other stores are rolling out digital price labels, which replace paper shelf prices with electronic screens. With digital price labels, stores can change prices on goods storewide with a few keystrokes. Democratic members of Congress, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have voiced concern that this technology could lead to “surge pricing” for groceries on days with high demand or when stores feel like they can squeeze a little more from their customers. Some states have moved to ban or limit this technology. Colorado ought to consider the same.  
As retailers prepare once again to manipulate prices, our elected leaders in Washington, D.C., and Denver need to pay close attention. They need to demand transparency in pricing practices to make sure consumers aren’t being exploited in times of economic uncertainty. 
Big box retailers have made clear they will shift with the political winds and use every trick in the book to maximize their profits. Our leaders should not let them get away with it.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the March 8, 2023, signing of the Arkansas LEARNS Act. The wide-ranging law created a statewide minimum teacher salary of $50,000 and a school voucher program, among other things. (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Sanders’ school vouchers program has taught us once again a self-evident lesson about human nature: Free money is popular.
For the upcoming school year, all parents in Arkansas qualify for about $6,800 in state subsidies for private school tuition or homeschool expenses, no matter how much money they make or the test results of the public schools their children attend. So not surprisingly, as of this writing, 45,500 applicants have stepped up to the trough, blowing through not only the $187 million legislators appropriated for the program in the state budget but another $90 million in reserve funds set aside just in case the appropriation ran out.
Arkansas Department of Education officials recently insisted to legislators that there will be enough money this year to hand out vouchers to every parent who qualifies, although the Arkansas Times did the math and made a compelling case that some parents are likely to be put on a waiting list.
Whether the money runs out this year or not, what’s clear is that the vouchers program, Sanders’ pet project, has become a voracious consumer of taxpayer dollars, with more than $374 million spent in the first three years — on a program that hasn’t, doesn’t, and won’t improve a single public school anywhere in Arkansas and which research shows will actually negatively affect educational outcomes for students who use it.
More than a few taxpayers might also be chagrined that voucher money has been used to subsidize enrichment activities for homeschool students that include horseback riding, ninja warrior training, cooking classes, and archery — activities that parents of public school students must pay for themselves. Or that vendors getting money from the program operate largely on an honor system when it comes to complying with program rules.
To their credit, Arkansas legislators didn’t set up the vouchers program as an entitlement with open-ending funding, which led to a budget meltdown in Arizona. Instead, they limited participation based on annual appropriations. When the money runs out, priority is given to students already in the program, and new students go on a waiting list.
 Funding alternatives?

But with expenditures now approaching $300 million a year, the fiscal cliff caused by the vouchers program will soon force lawmakers to start making difficult choices.
They could pay for vouchers by raising taxes, clearly a nonstarter for the Republican supermajority. They could also keep costs in check by limiting the number of participants. However, telling parents no after promising them free money would create intolerable political pressures, given that the point of the program is to allow parents with ideological opposition to public schools to escape from them. 
The third and most likely alternative: Find more money for vouchers by tapping into revenue growth or raiding existing programs in the state budget. Unless legislators discover a money tree growing on the Capitol grounds, they’ll have to prioritize vouchers over other things they might like to finance, including Sanders’ own often-stated desire to eliminate the state income tax.
And before legislators indulge the governor with hundreds of millions more dollars of voucher spending, they might want to more closely scrutinize how some of that money is being spent, as I did by filing a FOIA request for applications submitted by all 569 voucher vendors approved for the 2024-25 school year.
While voucher money handed out to parents of private school students mostly goes toward tuition, homeschool parents can use their vouchers with any vendor approved by the state.
Last fall, there was a public kerfuffle when a horseback riding stable in Fayetteville posted on Facebook that it was accepting voucher money. After the state’s own data showed just 44% of the voucher money given to homeschool parents went for education-related expenses, legislators limited voucher spending on extracurricular activities to 25% of the voucher amount, which is still about $1,700 a year.
Many of these vendors do offer educational services, including books, classroom materials, and tutoring, including specialized services for kids with learning disabilities. But the money is also being used for lessons in jiu jitsu and krav maga (an Israeli combat technique), musical training for aspiring rock stars, and specialized athletic training, in addition to the aforementioned horseback riding lessons, cooking classes, and ninja warrior instruction.
This is not to say that these vendors aren’t offering legitimate services, or that students aren’t benefiting. Dressage and ninja warrior training perhaps have their place. But why should the hardworking taxpayers of Arkansas be paying for any of this?
Parents certainly have the legal right to opt out of public schools and educate their kids themselves. But if they forsake the educational opportunities provided by law and financed by taxpayers, they should also assume the financial obligations that go with that decision, including paying for their kids’ extracurricular activities.
Vouchers instead create a perverse system that’s akin to going to a birthday party, turning up your nose at the cake on offer, and then asking the host to give you money to buy your own cake.
 Vetting vendors

Equally troubling is the ease with which someone can become a vouchers vendor, which requires going online and responding to 18 questions. Many of the applications, when printed out, come to just three or four pages;  once submitted, the review process by the Arkansas Department of Education takes just 10-15 days, which doesn’t leave much time for in-depth vetting before vendors start tapping into state funds.
Vendors also operate on an honor system. For example, they have to acknowledge, with their initials, that the services they provide meet program rules, but they are only required to “describe” the services, rather than provide detailed documentation of them. I found descriptions – in approved applications – that were as brief as a single sentence.
They must also acknowledge that they’ve done background checks on any employees who work directly with students, but the application does not require them to submit those background checks unless the education department asks to see them — one of the many scandals waiting to happen with this loose level of regulation.
 Vanity projects

State school voucher programs have become a new political fad, vanity projects pushed by right-wing governors looking to create a legacy. But the legislators going along with these schemes are paying scant attention to the long-term financial implications, which loom ever larger in Arkansas.
At some point in the future, Sanders will ride off into the sunset; the legislators who shoved through her vouchers program in less than three weeks will drift away. But vouchers will remain — a giant maw gobbling up taxpayer dollars that will bedevil future governors and lawmakers, while doing precious little to improve educational outcomes.
Which brings up another self-evident lesson for us to relearn: Free money may be popular, but it isn’t actually free.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)I’m a 31-year-old single professional, born and raised in Providence. Having spent more than half of my life shifting through foster care, I now work full-time for the State of Rhode Island and have over a decade of human and public service experience. And yet, despite my steady income and deep roots in this community, I find myself increasingly concerned about my housing stability. I’m struggling to find a safe, affordable place to live in the city I’ve always called home.
A part of the housing crisis we don’t talk about enough is the growing number of middle-income Rhode Islanders who are falling through the cracks. People like me — earning between $65,000 and $75,000 a year — are often excluded from affordable housing programs and don’t qualify for most public assistance. But the private market is simply out of reach.
I earn approximately $73,500 annually. After taxes, health care premiums, retirement contributions, and other deductions, my take-home pay is just under $4,200 a month. I live in a 400 square-foot studio because a modest two-bedroom apartment in Providence easily costs over $2,000 a month. That’s nearly half my income — far above the recommended 30% threshold for housing affordability.
And it’s not just the rent. It’s the rising cost of groceries, utilities, transportation, and student loan payments. For regular wage earners like me, the math simply doesn’t add up. We are trapped in what many call the “missing middle” — making too much to qualify for help, yet not enough to afford a basic standard of living in the city we serve.
My housing challenges are made even more difficult by a limited rental history. I lived in on-campus housing while attending Rhode Island College, followed by years of unstable or temporary living arrangements after I ran out of Federal Student Aid. This reality, coupled with a credit score that has been a consistent work in progress, creates significant barriers to accessing quality housing — barriers that are often invisible in policy frameworks but deeply felt in practice.
This isn’t just a personal hardship — it’s a structural failure. Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we’re not a fringe case. We’re the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind.
If Rhode Island is serious about solving its housing crisis, we need to stop treating middle-income earners as if we don’t need support. We need new strategies that include:

Expanding income eligibility thresholds to serve people earning 80% to 120% of Area Median Income;
Developing mixed-income housing models that reflect a broader range of lived experiences;
Adjusting credit and rental history requirements to account for the realities of those who’ve experienced systemic barriers;
Drafting a robust statewide housing plan — including a separate, targeted strategy to prevent homelessness.











Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we’re not a fringe case. We’re the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind. 


Housing is a human right — and one that must be extended to more than just those at the extremes of need. As a full-time public employee, I contribute daily to the well-being of my neighbors, and yet I’m on the verge of being priced out of the very community I serve. The fear of living in my car is not distant or dramatic — it’s real and immediate.
This isn’t a theoretical problem. It’s happening right now, to people you work with, rely on, and care for. Rhode Island’s housing crisis isn’t just about poverty — it’s about the collapse of affordability across the entire working class. We need housing policies and solutions that reflect the full range of our economic realities.
I share my story not to ask for pity, but to demand action — because this problem isn’t mine alone. It belongs to all of us. If we want to build a just and livable Rhode Island, we must ensure that housing honors the full spectrum of the people who live and work here.

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk International Airport)As scrutiny of flight safety intensifies nationwide, Norfolk International Airport officials say their shared airspace remains “safe,” thanks to close coordination with commercial airlines and military partners.
Questions about Norfolk’s airspace surfaced after a January collision between an American Airlines Bombardier jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River.  The crash, which killed all 64 people on board the jet, occurred as the plane prepared to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Reagan operates under restricted airspace to prevent aircraft from flying near high-risk areas and must accommodate heavy military and government air traffic. It’s located near the Pentagon, the White House, and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.
Like Reagan, Norfolk works closely with the military — especially  the Navy and Air Force — to manage constrained airspace and ensure helicopter traffic remains safely separated from its commercial runways.
“I think we are in a better situation,” said Mark Perryman, president and CEO of Norfolk International Airport, at the May 15 meeting with leaders in Hampton. “We’re not quite as congested (as DCA), although we do have a very congested airspace for an airport in a region our size, given all of the military installations, but it’s something that we have very good cooperation with the DoD and the FAA. We are safe.”
Perryman told the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO) that Norfolk has earned a reputation as one of the best domestic airports, expanding its nonstop flight offerings significantly over the past decade.
Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, who sits on the HRTPO, acknowledged the heightened public  interest in aviation safety. She said Norfolk’s advantage lies in the region’s long-standing civil-military  coordination — something that travelers should take comfort in. 
“Our airspace is safe because Hampton Roads has the strongest records of civil and military coordination in the country,” Anthony told The Mercury. 
She pointed to efforts in the 1990s to install advanced radar systems and transfer control tower operations as examples of the region’s aviation leadership. Anthony, who served on the engineering team at the time, described the transfer process as intense and technically complex.
Perryman also addressed helicopter traffic in the airspace north of Norfolk’s Runway 5/23. Unlike Reagan Airport, where helicopters operate closer to the flight paths, military choppers in Norfolk fly farther north, over the Chesapeake Bay. 
That distance provides “far greater vertical separation,” said airport spokesman Chris Jones — several hundred feet more than what’s typical in airspace near DCA.
In May, the FAA reduced the size of three designated helicopter operating areas near Norfolk’s approach paths, further enhancing safety.
Norfolk International Airport, originally a military field, has operated for 85 years. Within 20-miles are three military installations with runways used for fixed-wing aircraft: Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field, Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis on the peninsula in Hampton. 
Virginia Beach’s Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story lacks a runway but supports military helicopter traffic, Jones said.
With multiple facilities nearby and Newport News operating its own commercial airport, Hampton Roads remains a “busy region for aviation,” Jones noted, emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration. 
“In a region with so many airports and air bases, this is to be expected,” Jones said. “Despite this, the conditions and practices now in place are such that they do not elicit safety concerns for travelers or military aviators.”



 $5 million headed to Virginia airports

Seven airports in Virginia are set to receive a combined grant total of $5 million to support infrastructure improvements. The grants come through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration Airport Infrastructure Grant program.
U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, D-Va., have long supported improving Virginia’s airports.
“Investing in our airports means investing in safety, connectivity, and economic opportunity for communities across the Commonwealth,” said in a joint statement on June 27. “We’re proud to support these improvements that will help ensure Virginia’s airports continue to serve travelers and local economies for years to come.”
The grant awards
$2,948,555 to the Roanoke Regional Airport Commission to upgrade taxiways B, B1, B2, B3, and B4 at the Roanoke Regional Airport;
$730,000 to the City of Suffolk to expand the terminal apron Suffolk Executive Airport to allow for a wider variety of aircrafts;
$661,200 to the Chesapeake Airport Authority to remove trees obstructing operations at the Chesapeake Regional Airport;
$260,000 to the County of Halifax to install runway end identifier lights and a precision approach path indicator system at Halifax Stanfield International Airport;
$190,000 to the Town of Farmville to reconstruct the precision approach path indicator system for Runway 3/21 at Farmville Regional Airport;
$159,000 to the Dinwiddie County Airport and Industrial Authority to construct a new hanger for aircraft storage at Dinwiddie County Airport;
$110,000 to the Town of Tangier to reseal taxiway and apron pavement prolonging their lifespan at Tangier Island Airport.

Kelly Ayotte signed the law removing the income cap. (File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)Well before Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a bill last month to make New Hampshire education freedom accounts available to all income levels, school choice supporters were preparing to get the word out.
On June 10, Ayotte signed Senate bill 295, and a multi-prong awareness campaign kicked into gear. 
The conservative advocacy group Americans For Prosperity NH dispatched social media ads informing New Hampshire residents that the previous income cap on the voucher-like program had been eliminated. 
Supportive state senators like Victoria Sullivan, the Manchester Republican who authored the bill, began directing interested constituents to the sign-up portal for the program, which allows New Hampshire residents to receive state funds toward public and private school expenses. 
And the Children’s Scholarship Fund, the nonprofit organization that administers the education freedom accounts, blasted emails to every parent, school and provider currently participating in the program to tell them about the change.
The awareness campaigns worked. Within a week of Ayotte signing the bill, the Children’s Scholarship Fund had seen 2,000 additional people apply, according to the Concord Monitor.
“I got inundated with emails,” Sullivan said in an interview with the Bulletin. “It just became impossible to actually respond to everybody individually. So I used X and my Facebook page to give people the information as to where they could go to fill out the application.”
Ayotte signs universal EFA bill, parental bill of rights

And as of July 2, about 9,000 families have either completed or started an application for an education freedom account, Kate Baker Demers, the executive director of the fund, said last week. Not all of those families will finish and turn in those applications, Baker Demers said. But the numbers suggest the program could exceed lawmakers’ estimates of 7,500 students in the program next school year.
For newly eligible families, there was incentive to move quickly. While the law removes the income limits for the program, which previously sat at 350% of the federal poverty level, lawmakers included an annual cap on enrollees to mitigate some of the anticipated costs. That cap applied to families making more than 350%; the sooner those families submitted an application, the sooner they could guarantee themselves a spot.
Supporters of the program say the large surge in interest validates the Legislature’s push to make the program open to all income levels.
Democrat decries funding to wealthy 
But Democrats, who have opposed the education freedom account program from the beginning, say the preliminary numbers show that the program is already likely to exceed its budget. Democrats vociferously opposed Sullivan’s bill during the session, arguing that people in higher income brackets should not receive state support for private schools.
“The voucher scam proponents really underestimated the impact on purpose, I think, deliberately to deceive legislators to vote for the bill and to deceive Granite Staters,” said Rep. David Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat. 
Report: New Hampshire’s public school state spending levels lowest in U.S.

As part of making the program universal, lawmakers imposed a 10,000 student cap in the program’s first year, though a number of categories of students are not subject to that cap. It is unclear whether the state will hit that cap this year, though Baker Demers is dubious. She has predicted 8,500 voucher recipients in the coming school year once all applications are submitted and approved.
Supporters of the program say the large number of applications this summer are a reflection of the high number of families who wanted to use education freedom accounts but were just barely outside of the income limits. 
Sullivan said many parents of children with disabilities, who have been dissatisfied with the individualized education plans at their public school, have expressed excitement at the opportunity to explore alternative options with some state funding.
“I knew there were a lot of families that were just outside of the income cap last time, but there have been a lot of families with kids in special education that are not having their needs met in the public school that have reached out to me about it,” she said. “So that part was surprising to me.”
And Sarah Scott, field director of Americans For Prosperity NH, said the removal of the income limit could also be a boon for single parents.
“Single parents often have rough lives and the kids have struggled,” she said. “…A lot of those families weren’t eligible because when you look at 350% of the federal poverty line for a family of two ($74,025), it’s very low.”
More outreach planned
While the outreach in the last month has been relatively successful, proponents say many eligible families still likely do not know about the program. Scott said the online ads, for which the organization has paid about $10,000 so far, are designed to reach families who may not follow state politics closely enough to know about the change. 
“I think that prior to June 10, most of the families that were aware of the program were the people that are following what’s going on in their town in local politics,” she said. “Now I think we’re definitely seeing more and more of those families that are so wrapped up in, you know, driving their kids to afternoon sports, taking them to tutoring or you know Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.”
Sullivan added that though she is a believer in the education freedom accounts, which her children have received, private school or homeschooling may not be the right choice for many families.
“I don’t think it’s a program for every family,” she said. “A lot of families are happy with their public schools, and I wouldn’t want to be pushing people into an education that wasn’t right for them.”
The total tally of education freedom account students in the 2025 to 2026 school year will not be known for months. Families are allowed to apply throughout the year, but the bulk of applications happen before mid July. The Department of Education releases a report based on those numbers in November.
Luneau says he and other Democrats will continue to campaign against the education freedom accounts to turn voters against the idea of giving state funds to wealthy families. How wealthy those families are will not be clear. The families who say they are above the 350% poverty level do not need to submit income verification, or state their income at all.
And Luneau says he would also like more accountability over where the money is going and how the program vendors are approved. 
“This is a program that very quickly is going to be over $100 million a year, over a billion bucks — billion with a capital B — over a 10-year period,” Luneau said. “And that’s a billion dollars that isn’t going to be helping cities and towns or reducing property taxes. Essentially it’s a billion dollars that is going to be sitting on top of everyone’s property taxes.” 
Baker Demers and Scott counter that demand for the program will likely level out, and they say the state will be able to sustain the funding levels.
“I think that in the first couple of weeks, there’s always a lot of talk about it,” she said. “…But over the course of the next year, I think a lot of the families that really want to take advantage of it will be aware of it and will already have taken the steps to do that.”

Firearm suicides constituted an astounding 58% of all gun slayings in the United States in 2023, the most recent year for the available data, according to a new report from the Center for Gun Violence Solutions and Center for Suicide Prevention. Both centers are based at Johns Hopkins University.
In fact, suicides have accounted for the majority of all firearm deaths every year since 1995. That’s nearly three decades.
You wouldn’t know those facts from the outsized attention gun-related homicides receive. This includes coverage of mass shootings in which suspects mow down complete strangers or – as happened in Virginia – co-workers and fellow university students.
Guns were the weapon used in 46,728 deaths nationwide in 2023. Of that total, gun suicides reached a new annual high of 27,3000. The CDC also noted more than half of all methods of suicides that year involved a gun. Gun suicide rates among Black and Latino people ages 10-19 surged from 2014 to 2023.
The commonwealth’s gun suicide rate per 100,000 people was 8.38, 29th among the states. In 2022, of 1,316 gun deaths in Virginia, 723 were suicides and 556 were homicides.
Meanwhile, gun homicides in 2023 accounted for 17,927 deaths nationwide, falling almost 9% from 2022, the report said. But they still remain at near-record levels.
The COVID-19 pandemic saw a huge spike in gun sales in Virginia and nationwide, putting more guns within easy reach of more Americans. It’s a recipe for danger in too many households. 
“There hasn’t been an increase in suicide attempts. They just have become more fatal because there are more guns in houses,” Dr. Paul Nestadt told me. He’s the medical director of the Center for Suicide Prevention at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and a co-author of the new study.
Guns are also the most common method for “completed” suicides, he said. Even though firearms are used only in 5-6% of suicide attempts, they result in more than half of all suicides, according to a 2019 study cited in the Johns Hopkins report.
Such lethality means when someone thinks of ending his life, and then fires a gun, he probably won’t get a second chance.
Yet, “it’s a myth that if someone survives a suicide attempt, they’ll inevitably try again or simply find another method,” Nestadt said in online comments with the report. “ … The majority of people — about 94% of people who survive a suicide attempt — will continue to survive.”
Officials at Johns Hopkins and the nonprofit organization Brady: United Against Gun Violence, suggest several ways to intervene to prevent gun suicides. They include voluntary out-of-home gun storage for those with a higher risk of harming themselves, and assessment and counseling by health care providers regarding gun ownership.
Brady President Kris Brown told me her group began the “End Family Fire” campaign in 2019 to emphasize safe storage of firearms, including using a biometric safe or storing guns remotely when family members are thinking about ways to kill themselves. Those actions help prevent people from getting guns who are having a mental health crisis or suffering from depression. Firearm accessibility, Brown said, has played a role in increased teen suicides.
The United States, at just 4% of the world’s population, has 35% of the firearm suicides globally, she noted. “It’s horrific,” Brown said. “The thing to understand is that this is entirely preventable.”
Nestadt said Virginia is one of nearly two dozen states that have extreme risk protection orders, also known as “red flag” laws. The measures allow law-enforcement authorities to temporarily seize guns from people deemed dangerous.
He said studies show these laws save lives. A Duke University professor, for example, estimated in 2024 that one suicide death “could be prevented for every 17 or 23 issued” extreme risk protection orders. The research was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.
Journalists also have a role to play.
For too many years, we shied away from covering suicides for fear of increasing relatives’ pain, seeming too intrusive or inspiring potential copycats. We employed euphemisms and couched phrases instead of saying plainly how folks died.
That made the subject of suicides – no matter the method – taboo. It meant the causes of such self-harm weren’t examined in detail.
One unforgiveable example was the way my then-employer, The Virginian-Pilot, initially reported on the death in 2004 of reporter Dennis O’Brien.
He and I had been colleagues at both the (Newport News) Daily Press and The Pilot. O’Brien, 35, had made a name for himself during his dispatches from the Iraq war while embedded for months with a Marine unit.
The paper didn’t initially report the cause of death, leading to many justifiable questions from readers. As I recall, we violated our own newsroom guidelines because his body was found hanging in a public place – near some railroad tracks. That should’ve forced us to be candid.
It wasn’t until a few years later that The Pilot reported O’Brien had suffered from depression for much of his life.
Nestadt, the Johns Hopkins doctor, recalled talking to a family where the son had killed himself. Another family in that community had lost a child to cancer around the same time. Neighbors responded differently to the two families because of those circumstances.
“It should really be focused on,” he said. “One downside to not reporting on (suicides) is that families often feel so alone.”
My colleagues and I have a responsibility to do better. We should, along with all people concerned about firearm suicides, fight to end this underreported scourge.
It would help save lives.

(Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire median home prices hit a record high in June, soaring to $565,000, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, in the latest sign that the state’s housing market has yet to cool off. 
The increase, which came at the start of the typically-busy summer season, continues a more than five-year streak of climbing home prices in New Hampshire, which kicked off during the outbreak of COVID-19, according to the association. 
Last month was the first time the state has broken its price record since June 2024, when median prices hit $540,000. 
In comparison, the state broke the $300,000 median home price barrier only in 2019.
According to the association, there were 2,431 single family residential units for sale in New Hampshire at the end of June, a 66% decrease from the same month in 2016, when there were 7,112 homes for sale. According to the association, 2016 was the last year the state housing market was “balanced.”
The prices suggest that high demand for available housing, a slowdown in construction of new houses, and the reluctance of some homeowners to sell amid high interest rates are suppressing the ability of the state’s housing market to recover from the surge in sales from out-of-state buyers during the pandemic. 
“The idea of owning a home is becoming more challenging for too many New Hampshire residents, especially young families and first-time home buyers,” said Susan Cole, the association president, in a statement. “Demand for housing in our state is still very high, and these numbers suggest that trend is not going away soon.”
Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action N.H., an advocacy group for affordable housing, said the price increases indicate more legislation is needed next year to spur development. 
“When teachers, first responders, and hardworking Granite Staters can’t find homes they can afford, it threatens the strength of our communities and economy,” he said. “A bipartisan group of lawmakers took meaningful steps this legislative session to allow more attainable housing options, but with record high prices, it’s clear the work is far from done.”

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Of the many gun bills that went before the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee this past session, only one was signed into law, while others that passed both chambers will have to wait until next year to determine their final outcome. 
The committee advanced legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases that is currently tied up in court, serial numbers on ghost guns and a variety of other firearm-related measures. While the attempts to reform the state’s concealed carry laws and redefine “machine gun” were a bust, a few bills won’t be decided on until the next legislative session, which starts in January. 
One proposal did make it over the finish line with Gov. Janet Mills’ signing of an amended version of LD 1174. That legislation will limit the liability on gun shops that enter into firearm hold agreements. That law will take effect on Sept. 24, like all non-emergency laws passed this session. 
In late May, the committee decided it would wait to take action on any legislation regarding the 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases until the next session, in order to let the ongoing lawsuit play out. 
Lawmakers will also wait until next year to revisit LD 1867, which seeks to prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases. The measure passed both chambers, but was left for the budget committee to decide whether it could fund the bill’s $185,000 price tag and ultimately was carried over to next session.
Another bill currently in limbo is LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer, was sent to Mills in the final hours of the session. Since it was passed but unsigned when the Legislature adjourned sine die, the governor will have three days after the next session begins in January to sign it, allow it to become law without her signature or veto it. 
Red flag proposal going to voters without competing measure
A proposal for a red-flag law, which stemmed from a citizen-led initiative, did not pass the Legislature but will instead appear on the November ballot for voters to weigh in on. 
The Judiciary Committee didn’t end up holding a work session for LD 1378, despite it having an 11th hour public hearing after insistence from Republicans. 
The proposal would allow a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to petition for an extreme risk protection order if someone is posing a significant danger to themself or another person, which would prohibit them from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.”
Some gun rights proponents wanted to put an alternative on the ballot that would beef up Maine’s current yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. However, that proposal, which identified ways to strengthen the current law while also expanding mental health services to rural areas, never made it to a work session or a vote, so it will not appear on the ballot as a competing measure for voters to consider.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.


Arkansas lawmakers this year directed the state’s Department of Energy and Environment to hire a consultant to conduct a feasibility study for establishing nuclear power generation in the state.
Act 707 of 2025 took effect upon the governor’s signature in mid-April, meaning the department should pick a consultant by late July or early August. The law also requires a feasibility report no later than 15 months of the effective date.
Earlier nuclear power-friendly legislation in Arkansas has included studying the feasibility of recycling spent nuclear fuel rods in the state.


In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
North Dakota lawmakers to hold hearing on security concerns after Minnesota attacks

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters last month. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Man tried to retrieve gun before sending threatening email, prosecutor says

Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio’s food banks are strained as it is. Huge cuts to the safety net signed into law in recent days could overwhelm them, the director of a Columbus food bank said last week.
President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” cut trillions in taxes — mostly for the richest Americans — added trillions to the federal debt, and it cut more than $1 trillion in spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
In acknowledgement of the program’s unpopularity, some of the most painful of the benefit cuts won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterms. But some, such as administratively burdensome work requirements, could cost large numbers their food benefits.
In addition, the state budget Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed on June 30 provides $7.5 million less for food banks compared to last year.
Those cuts are on top of other recent cuts and as more families are in need because of the expiration of covid-era benefits, said Kathy Kelly-Long, director of the food pantry at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus.
“As the pandemic credits expired, our numbers kept growing,” she said one morning last week as volunteers bustled in and out of the pantry.
While the pantry served an average of 35 families a day at the height of the pandemic in June 2021, it served an average of 58 last month. That’s a 66% increase.

Among the cuts pantries have already suffered, one was the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s cancellation of the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program on June 30. That program enabled food banks to buy directly from nearby farmers. It fell under the budget axe of an unofficial agency that Trump assigned the world’s richest man to run.
“A lot of those farmers relied on those funds — built some of their business around that,” Kelly-Long said. “A guy who was here yesterday said they lost $25,000 worth of business when (the program) went out. So there’s an economic cost because that’s $25,000 worth of fresh, locally grown produce that’s not being distributed to low-income families who don’t have access to it.”
But her main concern is for the clients the pantry serves.
“We can’t even begin to calculate what the loss of SNAP dollars and Medicaid will mean to people,” Kelly-Long said. “Because the system is already broken, we can’t get enough food in now. If the numbers go up, we don’t know how much food people will be able to get from us. Will it be anywhere near enough to feed their families?”
Among those clients are many hard-working people.
“There’s a lovely woman who’s been shopping here for years,” Kelly-Long said. “She’s raised multiple grandchildren. She works a full-time job on second shift. She comes here to have enough food to get by for the week.”
Not only has the woman worked to carry her own weight and raised two generations of children, “she’s the one the neighbors always turn to when they need help,” Kelly-Long said.
As people lose health insurance and food benefits — and as food banks are less able to serve them — they’ll turn to cheaper, less nutritious sustenance, Kelly-Long said.
“It leads to heart disease, diabetes, hypertension,” she said. “We already have diet-related disease in this country. If you have more people eating cheap food because they need the calories, but don’t get the nutrients, it’s going to be compounded.”
She said she was frustrated by a lack of interest from U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. Both are Ohio Republicans who voted for the deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
“I’ve made multiple phone calls and have yet to talk to a real person,” Kelly-Long said. “Sen. Moreno, Sen. Husted, all of the emails I’ve sent, I get the same email back from the two of them, which indicates that somebody on their staff may have read it, but maybe not.”
She added that lawmakers in Washington, D.C. and Columbus fail when they pass bills that only benefit the few.
“To me, our legislators are not doing their job,” Kelly-Long said. “They were elected to represent the people in their districts — all of the people in their districts. And when they make decisions that benefit just a few people and harm the majority, that’s not doing their jobs.”

(Getty Images.)A group trying to repeal Ohio’s ban on gay marriage in the state’s constitution is one step closer to getting on the 2026 ballot. 
Ohio Equal Rights, a grassroots movement, submitted 2,000 signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on June 30 and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified the title and summary language on July 3. They needed to submit 1,000 valid signatures from registered Ohio voters.

“This certification should not be construed as an affirmation of the enforceability, constitutionality, or wisdom of the proposed amendment,” Yost said in a response letter to the petitioners. “Those matters are left for a different forum and another day.”
The Ohio Equal Rights Amendment would protect citizens from discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status, according to their website.  
“This is about securing the fundamental right of every Ohioan to be treated with dignity, fairness, and equality under the law,” said Liz Schmidt, a lead organizer for Ohio Equal Rights. “Our state constitution should reflect the values of inclusion and justice that Ohioans hold dear. This amendment ensures no one can be singled out or left behind because of who they are.”
Organizers say the proposed amendment would be the most comprehensive equal rights amendment in the country. 
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. 
The Ohio Ballot Board must now determine if the proposal contains only one constitutional amendment. If the board certifies the proposal, organizers can start collecting signatures. They would need to collect 413,487 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures would then need to be verified by the Ohio Secretary of State’s Office. 
A 2023 Public Religion Research Institute study showed 76% of Ohioans are in favor of non-discrimination LGBTQ+ laws.

The Ohio Senate put using the state’s unclaimed funds to help pay for the Browns stadium in their version of the budget, which was introduced on June 3.

“The Division (of Unclaimed Funds) saw an approximately 80% increase in claims initiated the week of June 3 compared to the previous week,” said Franklin Freytag, spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Commerce. 
About 133,250 claims were initiated from June 3-26, he said. To put this in perspective, there were 14,111 claims initiated the week of May 25-June 2, Freytag said. 
Ohio’s unclaimed funds is money that is property of Ohioans held by the state for things like forgotten bank accounts, rent or utility deposits, or uncashed insurance policies. An initiated claim is when someone submits a form to claim their funds. Additional documents are needed to prove ownership of the funds. 
The Division of Unclaimed Funds received approximately $528 million in unclaimed funds in fiscal year 2024 and 26,420 claims were approved for payment totaling approximately $149 million, Freytag said.
Ohio’s unclaimed funds is worth close to $5 billion, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recently signed the state’s two-year operating budget, which included giving the green light to spend $600 million of unclaimed funds on the Browns’ new domed stadium in Brook Park. The budget allows the state to take existing unclaimed funds that are at least 10 years old as of Jan. 1, 2026. 
“My criteria is it had to be holistic and universal, but it also would not spend money out of the general fund that directly competes with education (or) directly competes with mental health,” DeWine said. “Stadiums should not compete with mental health. Stadiums should not compete with education. And this budget, while it didn’t do it the way I originally designed it, does that. And those two things were my first priority.” 
DeWine and the Ohio House had different ideas for how to pay for the Browns stadium, but lawmakers ultimately went with the Senate’s plan during conference committee. 
“That was not my first choice,” DeWine said. “I had another way of doing it. But, you know, governors don’t get everything they want. Nobody gets everything they want.” 
DeWine had proposed doubling sports betting taxes while the Ohio House wanted to borrow $600 million by issuing bonds and repaying the debt, with interest, over 25 years, at a cost of about $1 billion. 
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost urged DeWine to veto the use of unclaimed funds for the Browns stadium.
“Billionaires should finance their own stadiums—full stop,” Yost wrote in his June 27 letter. “The $600 million handout for a single professional sports facility raises serious concerns about fiscal sustainability and fairness. … Most Ohioans will never set foot in the proposed Brook Park stadium or similar venues—whether due to lack of interest, team affiliation, or the unaffordable cost of attending professional sporting events.”
Two former Democratic lawmakers — former state Rep. Jeff Crossman and former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann — said they are going through with a class action lawsuit against the stadium funding plan.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Allow me a prediction: At some point, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility planned by CoreCivic in Leavenworth will imprison a man or woman on baseless charges. That person will be a legal resident of the United States, or perhaps even a full citizen.
It won’t matter. Because of inept federal law enforcement, because of racist executive orders, because of some awful event that we don’t yet know, this man or woman will be behind bars.
And all of us — because of the taxes we pay the federal government — will pay for it.


This might seem like an outrageous claim, depending on what news sources you follow. But it’s based on the unfortunate reality that our country’s government has already been doing this regularly since President Donald Trump’s return to office in January. You may support the president’s hardline views on immigration and the southern border. You may believe that everyone who has entered the country the “wrong way” should be deported. But his administration’s approach shows that no legal resident or U.S. citizen can be confident or comfortable either.
Some explanations might be in order. Many who oppose illegal immigration into the United States believe that there are two categories of people: legal and illegal.
That’s not true.
There are actually a wide array of immigration statuses. That can includes people who are in the United States as legal permanent residents — green card holders — and those who are here under various types of visa claims of asylum. I count at least 11 broad categories, with some in varied stages of legal flux.
In past months, we have seen the Trump administration repeatedly incarcerate and attempt to deport people who have a legal status. Their actions aren’t mistakes either: the administration has claimed it has the right to expel these residents, as surely as it has the right to expel those without a shred of legal protection.
I can list some of these people, if you like.

Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder and student activist at Columbia University.
Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student who wrote an op-ed critical of college administration.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father whose “withholding of removal” legal status was ignored.
Cynthia Olivera, a Canadian citizen with a U.S. work permit who was pursuing a green card.
Mahmoud Khalil, also a green card holder, also a Columbia student.

You get the picture.
You don’t have to agree with what any of these people said or did or believed. You don’t have to believe that they’re good people or bad people or middling people (the government has gone out of its way to persecute Abrego Garcia, for instance). What we do know is that they were all, to various degrees, lawful residents of the United States. That offered no protection when the masked agents arrived.
Likewise, citizenship offers no protection. The Trump administration has offered an interpretation of the Constitution at odds with the 14th Amendment to deny birthright citizenship. It has also deported U.S. citizen children with their noncitizen parents. From 2015 to 2020, at least 70 potential U.S. citizens were wrongly deported, according to the Government Accountability Office. Just last week, the administration announced that one of the Justice Department’s priorities would be denaturalization — in which citizenship is stripped from people for various infractions.
To summarize: Those here illegally aren’t safe. Those here legally aren’t safe. Citizens aren’t safe.
No one is safe.
Given these facts, it’s worth asking what people who claim to care about illegal immigration really want from the United States. Do they really want to stop people who came here the “wrong way” and welcome people who came here the “right way”?
Or do they instead want to create a racially pure nation in which Caucasian people hoard rights and privileges, while Latino people from Central or South America are accorded second-class status or expelled altogether? I’m sure many would deny any such desire. They might want to have a word with the government.
All of which brings us to Leavenworth. The longtime prison town has tussled with private operator CoreCivic over plans to reopen its facility. A judge once called the prison a “hell hole,” but sordid history fades at the prospect of cold, hard cash. CoreCivic has inked a deal with ICE to the tune of $4.2 million a month.
The reopened facility could house up to 1,000 inmates. Their care and the prison’s overall operations will be funded by you and me. That’s right, our federal tax dollars will go to support ICE and this very contract. Indeed, thanks to the passage of Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” huge new financial resources will flood immigration enforcement operations.
Americans and Kansans chose this contemptible path. They voted for the president, and they voted for senators and representatives who made this new funding a reality.
We now have to live with the consequences. Our government is abusing its people, stripping them of residency and citizenship on the flimsiest of pretexts. It will continue doing so. And the money that all of us earn doing our jobs will support those efforts.
In Leavenworth. In Kansas. In these United States.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Last week, Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio’s two-year budget into law. Before doing this, he issued 67 vetoes, significantly reshaping the budget that was sent to him by the General Assembly. While he made many changes to the budget, the following three stood out to me as potentially having a significant effect on Ohio’s economy.
Tightening fiscal policy for public schools
Ohio lawmakers have been looking for ways to reduce the impact of property taxes on property owners and renters for a couple of years now. One of their solutions was to impose new rules on school districts that limited the amount of cash they could hold from year to year, mandating property tax decreases to make up for cash not being spent.
The perverse incentives in this policy should be clear to a reader. While it could lead to lower property taxes, it could also lead to school principals making mass purchases of unneeded equipment at the end of the year rather than saving funds for more useful purchases the year after. 
Ensuring public school districts aren’t dealing with arbitrary limits on their reserve funds will allow for fiscal flexibility that will benefit public schools making tough decisions around long-term financial planning.

Reduction of Medicaid coverage for children under age four
Medicaid is another category of state spending that legislators have been eyeing. Medicaid is the top insurer of Ohioans and even though the federal government picks up a large portion of the tab for Medicaid, the state still spends billions of dollars on it per year. One way legislators were planning to reduce state spending on Medicaid was to require families with young children to do more paperwork, increasing the chance they will miss a deadline and lose their health coverage. 
While this is a way to save money, it would also lead to lower health insurance coverage rates and more fiscal instability for families with young children. This also would happen at a crucial moment in child development. This veto has the potential to keep coverage for more households with young children, getting them off to a good start with health and family resources.
Limiting voters’ ability to fund local services
Another strategy state lawmakers have adopted to reduce property taxes is to empower county lawmakers to reduce local property taxes at will, even overturning levies passed by voters. This would allow county leaders to reduce property taxes, lowering rates for property owners and renters, but also reducing resources for local schools and human services. If this provision was left in the budget, it could have led to lowered property tax rates across the state and less resources for local governments that rely on these property taxes.
Ohio’s state budget is a long, labyrinthine document. It also is the main tool policymakers use to set public policy in the state. The decisions in this document have wide-reaching implications that impact the future of our economy, poverty, inequality, education, health, and well-being of Ohio and its residents. Now the ball is in the court of the General Assembly to see how many of these 67 vetoes will stand.

The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Among the many remarkable news reports that emanated from Washington last week as Congress put the finishing touches on President Trump’s massive budget bill, one was truly shocking.
The day before its final passage, Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers that the bill should not touch Medicaid if the GOP hoped to win in the 2026 elections.
But, of course, as one of the members told Trump, quote: “We are touching Medicaid.”
Indeed, the word “touching,” is an all-time understatement. The so-called “big, beautiful bill” doesn’t just touch Medicaid, it utterly wrecks it.
The White House tried to put a fig leaf on the president’s stunningly uniformed comment, saying that the bill would only cut waste fraud and abuse, but as has been repeatedly documented, that’s simply false.
The bottom line: Millions of Americans on Medicaid are about to lose their health insurance as a result of the massive cuts the legislation inflicts and the Republicans who voted for it – including the entire North Carolina GOP delegation save for Sen. Thom Tillis – are going to rue making it happen.

Yes, that’s the word.
Even so, the focus was diffused because Bacon’s decision came amid the process of Congress passing and the president signing the “one, big beautiful bill.” Sure we’re not taxing tips (up to a point), Social Security (well, for a couple years) and the winners tell us peace and prosperity are on the horizon. 
That characterization is a cruel irony, however, because at its core the new law is not beautiful but rather ugly on its face, a design to disfigure wide swathes of America as we know it. 
Real impact
The following are some lowlights from this Big Ugly, all of which Nebraska’s delegation — including the departing Bacon —thought were good ideas:

Take away Medicaid coverage for an estimated 17 million, including an estimated 40,000 Nebraskans.
Reduce SNAP food support for hungry children and disabled vets.
 Create a huge domestic police force and build ominous “camps” eerily reminiscent of horrid human history.
 Give tax breaks to those who need them least while cutting benefits for those who need them most. 
 Balloon the deficit by nearly $4 trillion.
 Eliminate funds for contempt of court orders, effectively restricting the judiciary from enforcing its rulings.
 Jeopardize rural health care facilities with Medicaid cuts. Last Thursday, the day the Big Ugly passed, a Nebraska clinic closed in Curtis, citing the anticipated loss of support.

How does any of that better the lives of Nebraskans — or the rest of the country for that matter? 
Supporters in Congress and the White House press room gaslighted us or simply lied about the effects of the law. 
For example, Medicaid cuts, they argued, were necessary because of “waste, fraud, and abuse,” which, aside from a few harrowing anecdotes, never became specific numbers. Some said Medicaid would not be cut, even when every credible economic forecast, including Congress’ own research at the CBO said otherwise.
The deflection is on brand. The Big Ugly is not only carbuncle unattractive; it is unpopular. Polls showed it underwater, both as a whole and in its individual parts. 
Nor was the bill particularly popular in the House or the Senate, where Vice President J.D. Vance had to cast the deciding 51st vote. Several senators, most notably Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, spoke bravely and boldly against the bill … then voted for it after securing some carveouts for her state. So much for the brave and the bold.

Nevertheless, it passed. Bacon joined Nebraska’s U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood, plus U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Rickitts as dependable rubber stamps in the face of massive unpopularity. 
In a rural state like Nebraska, the specter of small hospitals closing is just one potential horror story that the hits to Medicaid could produce. Next year, Nebraskans have a chance at the ballot box to express themselves. 
Trump whipped votes
The current iteration of politics that Bacon is choosing to leave was in clear relief as I watched the PBS NewsHour last week. During a segment called “Politics Monday,” Amy Walter, the well-respected political reporter and poll watcher from the Cook Political Report was discussing the conundrum for GOP members in the House and Senate who had misgivings about the Big Ugly. 
She said they faced either the wrath and retribution of the president if they voted against the bill or the wrath and retribution of Elon Musk (yes, him again) who had joined the fray against the Big Ugly. Walters said that politically they were better off pleasing the president for fear of being called out on social media or “primaried,” apparently the modern equivalent of political doom.
Really? This is where we are? What about the wrath and retribution of voters? Are members of Congress not there to solve problems or move America forward or pay attention to constituents’ aggregate concerns but rather to keep their jobs, please their party and serve the president —no matter the price? Today that’s the cost of the nation-changing Big Ugly. 
Some argue congressional term limits would solve that problem. Maybe, but the loss of institutional knowledge and increased influence of PACs and lobbyists would arrive with term limits, creating a different set of  problems. Besides, the issue isn’t structural.
I’m not suggesting Jimmy Stewart’s naive, platitude-spouting Jefferson Smith return to Washington. Or maybe I am. I do wonder, though, what has happened to independent political voices? To statesmen and stateswomen? To profiles in courage?
We’ll see if Nebraskans and Americans want to find some in 2026.

Photos contributed by the candidatesTwo Georgia Democrats are facing off to secure the party’s nomination for the District 3 seat on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. Keisha Sean Waites, a former state representative and Atlanta City Councilwoman, is competing against Peter Hubbard, a clean energy advocate, on the July 15 ballot. 
The runoff election comes after last month’s statewide special primary where no candidate received 50% of the vote, although Waites came close. With 58,022 votes, Waites won over about 46% of voters in the primary, and Hubbard trailed 16,110 votes behind her with about 33% of the vote. Robert Jones, a third challenger, accounted for the remainder of votes. Daniel Blackman also campaigned as a District 3 Democratic candidate but was disqualified last month for failing to meet residency requirements, and any votes cast in his favor were not counted.
District 3 includes Clayton, Fulton and DeKalb counties, but commissioners are elected statewide and must live within the district for 12 months to be eligible. 
Despite being the frontrunner in last month’s primary, Waites is a newcomer to the realm of utility rates and energy demands. But the Georgia native argues her experience at the statehouse and city hall would help her if elected to the commission. Waites left the council in 2024 for an unsuccessful run for the Fulton County Clerk of Superior Court last year. She is also a former candidate for the Fulton County Commission and U.S. Congress. 
“I think when you look at my legislative record, when you look at my history and work of community service, all of those things clearly set me aside from my opponent,” she said.
Hubbard, who has lived in Georgia for the past decade, has dedicated his career to energy policy and politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia House of Representatives in 2022. 
In 2019, he founded the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, a nonprofit aiming to fight for clean energy and lower power bills. On behalf of the nonprofit, Hubbard has provided testimony at numerous commission hearings over the years. 
“I’ve presented increasingly detailed, sophisticated analysis, so I don’t have to learn on the job. I’m ready to hit the ground running,” Hubbard said.
Waites acknowledged Hubbard’s experience but questioned his effectiveness.
“I’m trying to figure out if Peter was so effective, then why are we even having the conversation we’re having right now?” Waites said, referring to the uptick in utility bills. 
Rising utility bills and increased energy demands have emerged as top concerns for voters across the state. Democratic candidates have seized on that voter angst and are vowing to work to lower utility bills.
“Like the 10.8 million (other) Georgians, I’ve had one of these colossal skyrocketing bills, and so has my mom, and so has my dad and the people that I love and care about in the community that I live in,” Waites said.
Waites said she is concerned about Georgia Power’s profit margins over the last decade, and she has also proposed a tiered rate system to help combat rising rates that would provide relief to lower income Georgians. She also wants to ensure that the financial burden from data centers does not affect Georgia families. 
Hubbard argued that commissioners cater to large corporations and has cast himself as the candidate who can best recenter the commission’s focus on Georgians.
“There’s a larger commitment to address the injustice and inequity that we’re seeing in how power prices are set,” Hubbard said. “In particular, I think there’s just a true lack of accountability and disregard for the public at the Public Service Commission and I think that that is truly what distinguishes me as the nominee, as someone who is going to go in and fight for Georgians.”
While both candidates support lowering utility bills, they both share concerns about the effectiveness of a recent rate freeze. Since 2023, the average Georgia Power customer is paying $43 more each month. Last week, current commissioners unanimously approved a plan from Georgia Power that will freeze current rates through 2028, though customers’ bills could still rise next year.
With storm clean-up fees and fuel cost adjustments likely awaiting Georgia Power ratepayers in the future, Waites compared the freeze to purchasing an airline ticket and still being stuck with additional baggage and seat charges. 
“The fees, the riders and the fuel cost adjustments are still there and can fluctuate at any time,” Waites said. “So Georgia Power can come back and say, ‘hey’, they can submit a proposal and ask for it to be reviewed. So the rate freeze is really disingenuous.”
Hubbard says the freeze “locks in” six rate increases approved by commissioners over the past three years. He said the promise of at least $2.89 of monthly relief on power bills in previous long-term plans have since been abandoned.
“They’re saying, ‘hey, look, we’re going to freeze rates so there’s no downward pressure,’ which is really a fiction, from the point of view of the Republican policy,” Hubbard said. “They just have never delivered on downward pressure on rates.” 
The future of nuclear energy in Georgia has also dominated campaign messages. 
Worried about the potential health impacts of toxic coal ash ponds, Waites said she does not see a problem with nuclear energy. With confidence that the sun and wind are both constant renewable resources, she would like to see increased conversation surrounding wind and solar energy.
“When you look at the $296 million that we’ve given out of incentives to incentivize data centers to come to Georgia, I think that we can start to put some programs in place to introduce more families to solar,” Waites said.
While Hubbard’s nuclear support corresponds with its carbon-free nature, he said he is acutely aware of the costs associated with the energy source. He says that while Plant Vogtle helped reduce the state’s carbon footprint, this was not a cheap accomplishment. The expansion project was years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget when it was completed last year. 
“Once you have the nuclear plant, it’s cheap to dispatch, it’s cheap to run, but it’s very expensive to build,” Hubbard said. “So that’s the part that concerns me, is if we’re proposing to build any new nuclear (plants) there must be strict cost controls.”
Both candidates hope to advance to November’s general election for a chance to face appointed Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson. Commissioners typically serve six-year staggered terms, but a long-running legal challenge targeting the system for electing commissioners means that the District 3 winner will serve a one-year term and be back up for election next year.
A lawsuit challenging the at-large voting method for the district-based commission seats is pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That case, originally filed in 2020, argues that the statewide elections dilute the voting strength of Black voters. Only one Black commissioner has ever been elected under the system. Johnson, who is Black, was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.
The District 3 race will be on the November ballot with the District 2 race between Republican Commission Tim Echols and Democratic challenger Alicia M. Johnson. District 2 represents a wide swath of southeast Georgia, stretching from Hart County to Savannah. 
There will be one week of early voting that will start Monday, July 7. With only a 2.5% turnout in the June primary, the Democratic runoff is also projected to see low turnout. Some counties will only operate a single early voting location to accommodate an anticipated limited number of voters.

CT Democrats might want to look in the mirror,Rob Sampson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/07/no-kings-ct-democrats-might-want-to-look-in-the-mirror/,"While Connecticut may not have kings, it certainly has a ruling class. And someone needs to stand up to them.","As the 2025 legislative session sprinted to its conclusion on June 4, legislative Democrats turned to Republicans for help in moving hundreds of bills before the deadline— part of a final, frantic push to pass legislation before the midnight deadline.
 It’s chaotic, rushed, and often deliberately opaque. But even while we are in the minority, Senate Republicans still hold a powerful tool: time. And when used wisely, time exposes everything the majority would rather you not see.

State Sen. Rob Sampson
This year, we used our toolkit to full effect. We challenged bad bills, demanded answers, and forced real debate. Along the way, we revealed exactly why Connecticut continues to suffer from high costs, intrusive government, and a lack of accountability.
One of the most troubling examples was Senate Bill 1370, a piece of legislation that should alarm every taxpayer. It would dramatically expand the state’s prevailing wage law —requiring not only that union-level wages (often two to three times higher than the competitive market rate) be paid for labor on public job sites, but also for off-site fabrication of any materials used in those projects.
This means that small manufacturers and shops —many of which are family-run and barely staying afloat— would be forced to inflate their bids because of government-imposed wage mandates, even when the work happens nowhere near a construction site. It also means that much of the “off-site” fabrication will now also occur “out-of-state.”
The consequences? Massive cost increases for local governments, which are already required to pay prevailing wage on most infrastructure and construction projects. Towns and cities across Connecticut will face a simple but painful choice: raise local property taxes or cut core services like education. And make no mistake—SB 1370 doesn’t spare anyone. It hurts contractors, taxpayers, and schoolchildren alike.
Not surprisingly, Democrats couldn’t get this bill passed on its own merits. So, they did what has become their go-to move: they buried it in the 700-page state budget at the last minute, avoiding direct debate and public scrutiny.
As Chair of Policy and Screening, I made sure it didn’t go unnoticed. I forced open debate and demanded transparency. And what did Democrats do in response? They doubled down —but not without revealing their own hypocrisy. They exempted the state’s own Department of Transportation from the new mandate, silently acknowledging —without saying so— that the policy would be financially disastrous.
This is the kind of legislative sleight-of-hand that erodes public trust. And sadly, SB 1370 is just one example.
The $56 billion budget passed this year represents a nearly 14% increase in state spending, one of the largest in recent memory. Yet Democrats continue to insist there will be “no new taxes.” That claim is implausible on its face. The money must come from somewhere, and Connecticut families already shoulder one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Bookmark this column. We’ll revisit that promise when the tax hikes arrive.
Worse still, many of the budget’s line items amounted to a political patronage list than a responsible fiscal blueprint. Hidden within the fine print are dozens of earmarks—many vague or inexplicable —allocating taxpayer funds to entities with little public oversight. That’s why I’ve initiated a deeper review of these items. Accountability isn’t optional; it’s essential.
Much has also been made of my role in slowing down the session’s final days. Senate Republicans, under the leadership of Sen. Steve Harding and with me in a key role as Policy and Screening Chairman, used every procedural tactic we had —debate, amendments, and pointed questions —to make sure bad bills didn’t pass in darkness.
In response, House Speaker Matt Ritter claimed that I referred to myself as “the king” during the final days of session—a mischaracterization he invented. That’s not only false, but it’s also a stunning bit of irony.
While Democrats held rallies proclaiming “No Kings” and accusing others of authoritarianism, they were the ones bypassing committee hearings, rushing through last-minute bills, and packing unrelated policy into giant omnibus measures with no real accountability. In reality, no one exercises more unilateral power in this state than the progressive Democrats in charge of our legislature.
Their supermajorities give them the ability to pass virtually anything if they consider it a priority. If a bill didn’t make it to the finish line, it’s because they didn’t fight for it—not because Republicans stopped it. We can bring issues into the light, offer tough amendments, and use time to force the majority to choose what matters most— but at the end of the day, they still get to choose. Blaming me is nothing more than political scapegoating. And frankly, it proves we’re being effective.
Now, even as the regular session ends, Democrats are threatening a special session to force through their extreme housing bill—a proposal that amounts to a statewide takeover of local zoning authority. Even Gov. Ned Lamont seems hesitant to sign it. He should be.
The people of Connecticut are frustrated—and they have every right to be. They’re tired of being told one thing and seeing another. Tired of skyrocketing costs, vague spending, and legislative tricks that put government control above common sense.
That’s why I’m here. That’s why I’ll keep fighting —on the floor, in committee, in special session, and in every column like this one.
Because while Connecticut may not have kings, it certainly has a ruling class. And someone needs to stand up to them.

Just as King George III declared war upon the colonies for what he called “open and avowed rebellion,” and called upon British loyalists to “disclose and make known all treasons and traitorous conspiracies,” the current President of the United States has similarly declared a political war against all those who oppose his power and who refuse to pledge their loyalty, not to the Constitution, but solely to him.  Like King George, he has divided the electorate, calling upon American citizens to turn against each other politically, socially, and economically to consolidate unbridled power.
He signed into law his Big Beautiful Bill, a financial boon to America’s wealthiest but a bill of goods paid by America’s most vulnerable with increased poverty, suffering, and lost lives.
He bragged “Promises made, promises kept,” after signing a bill that cruelly reneged on his promise to protect Medicaid.  His bill will cause at least 17 million Americans to lose their health coverage, according to the Washington Post.
Instead, he has allocated billions of dollars toward immigration enforcement measures that have already proved exorbitant, cruel, unlawful, and arbitrary.  Or, in the words of the Founding Fathers, he has obstructed “the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither.” It’s already clear to American farmers that migrants are vital to American agriculture.
He has reduced America to a veritable police state by empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the national guard, U.S. marines, local police and even neighbors to aid in the arrest, detention, and deportation of both illegal immigrants and U.S. protesters without due process.  Indeed, Trump’s response to protestors in Los Angeles may as well have prompted this grievance from the Founding Fathers: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.”
He has threatened, intimidated, bullied, and attacked politicians, legislators, judges, and corporations that have participated in the prosecution of his crimes, or that have opposed his executive orders, policies, political ambitions, frivolous lawsuits, and blatant lies.
He has attempted to undermine law firms that prosecuted him for his crimes or represented his political adversaries, by restricting their access to government buildings and cancelling government contracts with the firms’ clients.
He has sued media outlets that he considers political adversaries, and he’s stalled government approval for media mergers unless they capitulate to his demands.
He has arrested and transported to jurisdictions amenable to deportation protestors and activists opposed to the President’s policies.  He has deported immigrants to foreign prisons and to lawless places where their lives are endangered.  He has delayed or defied court orders that overruled illegal deportations and detainments.
He has turned a nation, which once proudly stood as a beacon of freedom, opportunity, and compassion, that welcomed the oppressed–“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” — into a detention prison aptly called Alligator Alcatraz.
As part of his racist agenda, ICE has racially profiled Latinos for arrest, detention, and deportation without just cause.  His military has closed the border to refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution. Meanwhile, he has welcomed white South African “refugees” claiming they face discrimination and violence at home, despite denials by the South African government.
He signed an executive order, on Martin Luther King Day, ending federal Diversity, Equity, and Equity programs.  He has threatened and financially penalized businesses and schools that support DEI programs designed to redress two centuries of systematic racial exclusion and inequality.
He has opposed the teaching of critical race theory or any classroom discussion that makes white students aware of, or uncomfortable about, past or present racial discrimination in America.
He has withheld government funding to universities that practice and protect free speech, free thought, and free assembly when curriculum, staff, or students oppose the president’s policies.
He has signed an executive order to impose patriotic education upon school children as a means of indoctrinating them to view American history and policies in a strictly jingoistic light.
The Founding Fathers duly noted that “mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.”
Indeed, while Americans celebrate America’s great fight for independence, I fear we no longer recognize the repression that ignited it, understand the freedom gained by it, nor possess the resolve to continue it.

(Photo by Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune)Search and rescue efforts continued Sunday morning for 10 missing girls and one counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian camp for young girls at the center of the catastrophic floods that swept the Texas Hill Country, local officials said at a news conference.
At least 68 people were killed by the flooding in Kerr County, Sheriff Larry Leitha said. At least 11 additional deaths were confirmed in surrounding counties, pushing the storm’s overall toll to at least 79. That surpassed the estimated 68 deaths directly caused by Hurricane Harvey in southeast Texas in 2017.
The National Weather Service issued another warning Sunday afternoon for Kerr County, indicating that more flash floods would be possible in the area until 10 p.m.
More than 400 first responders from over 20 agencies were on the ground combing the area Sunday, Leitha said.
Among the dead in Kerr County were 28 children and 30 adults.
“We have increased our number of personnel who are navigating the really challenging shores along the bank line, but we’re continuing to make progress,” said Dalton Rice, city manager of Kerrville.
[In Texas region prone to catastrophic floods, questions grow about lack of warning]
Friends and families posted desperate messages online seeking help locating the missing campers. Many more people could still be unaccounted for, officials warned, noting that visitors to the area for the July 4th weekend make it difficult to assess an exact number of people unaccounted for.
“We will be relentless in going after and assuring that we locate every single person who’s been a victim of this flooding event,” Gov. Greg Abbott said during a news conference held earlier in the day with state and federal officials.
At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Abbott said he visited Camp Mystic the previous day and saw the aftermath of the flood’s devastation.
“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” he said. “We know that parents and families, they want information, they want closure, and we want them to know that we are working as swiftly as possible to get them accurate information that will provide that closure.”
Colonel Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said officials expect the death toll to rise between Sunday and Monday.
Abbott expanded the disaster declaration he issued Friday night to include Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Guadalupe, Travis and Williamson counties given continued rain and ongoing flooding. And on Sunday, President Donald Trump approved Abbott’s request for a federal disaster declaration, making Kerr County eligible for federal aid. The move opens up grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals recover from the effects of the disaster.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday said that the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol had already been involved in rescue efforts while U.S. Customs and Border Protection were assisting with coordination.
In the span of 36 hours, first responders have rescued more than 850 people, some clinging to trees to stay safe amid the rising water, Abbott said.

In response to criticisms of the warning provided by National Weather Service ahead of the flood, Noem said upgrading their technology was among the reforms Trump sought to make at the department.
However, the agency has been dealing with staffing shortages after cuts by the Trump administration led to nearly 600 layoffs and retirements. Whether those cuts had any effect on the National Weather Service’s ability to predict or warn people of the oncoming flood remains an open question. Though, the agency itself said it had adequate staffing.
As floodwaters receded in the Kerrville area, the damage was becoming clear. Dozens of tree trunks were snapped in half, some at 90 degree angles. Black and silver power lines were tangled with branches along the side of the road. A few tree trunks appeared to have been stripped bare of their bark from the rushing water.
At Cross Kingdom Church, Pastor Justin Carpenter started collecting clothing, nonperishable food, toiletries and cat and dog food Friday afternoon. They had reached capacity with donations and were turning other potential helpers away. So far, only about half a dozen people had shown up seeking help. Because the areas most affected has lost cell service, it’s been hard to reach people in need.
“The biggest thing would be to get the word out into the community that we’re here and ready to give everything out,” he said.
Billy Lawrence, a 73-year-old San Angelo man, has dealt with this type of tragedy before. During flooding in the summer of 1987, he spent more than 30 days looking for bodies. The first one he found was of a child in a tree, 20 feet up.
But he said this flood is twice as bad as it was in 1987. On Saturday, he was back patrolling the river for bodies. A former volunteer with the Red Cross, he said he’s gotten used to the morbid practice.
“I’m used to death. I’ve been around it a lot,” Lawrence said.
He noted there are about 20 camps along the river in this area and said the camp counselors should receive training to check the weather every night.
“I’m not blaming them. They just have to do that,” he said.

President Donald Trump expressed his condolences in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.
“Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Trump wrote. “Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!”
About 10 inches of rain fell within a few hours, causing flooding along the Guadalupe River which rose 26 feet in 45 minutes.
The death toll in an area historically prone to major flooding has raised questions about whether people near the river, including many vacationers in town for the Fourth of July weekend, received sufficient warning.
The private forecasting company AccuWeather and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation.
“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said in a statement that called the Texas Hill Country one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.
Local officials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months’ worth of rain for the area.
One National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to six inches of rain, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said.
However, Porter emphasized that people and officials should always take safety precautions when there is a potential for flooding.
“People, businesses, and governments should take action based on Flash Flood Warnings that are issued, regardless of the rainfall amounts that have occurred or are forecast,” Porter said. “Flash Flood Warnings indicate an immediate risk to life and property in the warned area.”
At the Sunday afternoon news conference, Abbott said local officials in Kerrville faced a tough decision about whether to order residents to evacuate after the flash flood warnings.
“It’s a difficult decision about whether or not to begin evacuating people, because if you have a warning telling everybody to evacuate, you could actually lead them to their death,” Abbott said. “But we know that some deaths in Kerrville were people … who got swept away who were trying to evacuate, and so local officials know best about the terrain, the danger spots and things like that.”

In response to pharmacy closures across Delaware stemming from Rite Aid’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, state officials are taking swift action to safeguard residents’ access to essential medications.
Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro has issued Bulletin No. 153, outlining steps that health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must take to reduce disruption and ensure continuity of care.
“Minimizing disruptions in pharmacy services is vital to ensuring the health and safety of Delawareans,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “Insurers and PBMs should ensure access to and coverage for emergency prescription refills, streamline the prior authorization and prescription transfer process, ensure fair reimbursement rates for pharmacies absorbing displaced patients, maintain adequate pharmacy networks, and communicate with affected policyholders.”
The closures could potentially leave thousands of patients without convenient access to their medications, prompting calls for both insurers and patients to act quickly.

Navarro urged residents to proactively transfer prescriptions and encouraged healthcare providers to reach out to patients about switching pharmacies.
According to the Department of Insurance, a surge in prescription transfer requests is expected as displaced Rite Aid customers seek alternative pharmacies.
To address this, the Board of Pharmacy has authorized one-time emergency prescription refills, which insurers are now required to cover—even in cases where a prescriber is unavailable due to the closures.
Prescription records or pharmacy databases may be used for verification in these cases.
Insurers are also required to streamline the prescription transfer process and notify policyholders about closures, offering clear instructions and dedicated support—such as hotlines or web portals—to help facilitate the transition.
The bulletin also mandates automatic transfer of prior authorizations for medications tied to closed Rite Aid locations.
That includes expedited handling for specialty drugs and controlled substances, ensuring patients don’t face delays or added administrative burdens.
PBMs are directed to provide fair reimbursement rates to pharmacies taking in displaced patients and to avoid policies that steer patients toward specific providers or mail-order options—practices that are prohibited under Delaware’s Pharmacy Access Act.
Officials stressed the need to preserve access, especially in rural and underserved communities.
The emergency measures authorized by the Board of Pharmacy will remain in effect for 120 days unless extended or modified.
The Department of Insurance said it will monitor compliance closely and may issue additional guidance as the situation develops.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-06-at-3.38.25-PM.png,,,2025-07-06 16:02:04.238496

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico last week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom last week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though that’s obviously a fictional scenario, some historians say Washington did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a new country while enslaving people. His will, signed six months before his death in 1799, ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the Virginia planter does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes [music] lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county, and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.
“‘You don’t think I deserve the same freedom I fought for you to have?’” Prather said Oscar Marion asks. “‘You don’t think I deserve the same thing?’”
The play, which showed an abridged preview in May, is only able to tell the story of a handful of enslaved people. Prather wants people to take away a broader curiosity of their role in the war.
“There are so many untold stories that need to be told,” Prather said. “We won’t get to tell them all, but hopefully we’ll give people enough of a taste that they will go and do some of their own research.”

Swaths of western South Dakota are considered legal deserts, where barriers such as poverty, lack of transportation and internet access, combined with a lack of attorneys, make it difficult for people to access legal help.
The new effort helps immediately address the problem while work continues on longer-term solutions, such as the state rural lawyer recruitment and retention program.

Dakota Plains Legal Services used a $125,000 state grant to launch its Justice Bus program. The bus is used to connect South Dakotans with legal aid for civil cases, such as custody, abuse and neglect, or protection orders.
The money came from the Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts, which awards grants funded by a $25 filing fee applied to some court documents.
An inability to access civil legal aid has consequences for South Dakotans, said Jana Gray, director of development and special projects for Dakota Plains.

“They might not be able to gain custody of their children, get a protection order or they might just give up,” Gray said.
The bus has stopped in Pierre, Winner, Gregory and other rural towns in western South Dakota. Gray said the organization plans to attend tribal powwows, known as wacipis in Dakota, Lakota and Nakota, and other community events this summer.
So far, the nonprofit has collected five applications for legal aid at community stops this year. That’s promising, Gray said.
People can fill out applications and receive legal aid on the spot, inside the outfitted vehicle. Gray hopes to regularly schedule visits to communities in the future and provide clinics on specific, prevalent legal issues in a community.
The Justice Bus will be at Eagle Butte’s Hometown Days on July 17, according to the Dakota Plains Legal Services calendar.

One less-known, missing part of many of these communities is legal representation, Peters said, which leaves people without recourse to handle problems of that nature or even the knowledge of when a lawyer is needed.
Peters, joined by two ISU students and future lawyers, conducted a study into lawyer shortages across the U.S. to identify where there is most need and go over practiced and possible solutions to ensure even those living in remote areas have access to the legal help they need.
“Not having enough lawyers puts rural people at a disadvantage because the legal system only really works if you have a lawyer that can either assert your rights or (provide) a mechanism to seek redress,” Peters said.

Emma Bartling graduated from ISU in the spring with a degree in agricultural and rural policy studies, and has enrolled in the University of South Dakota for law school with hopes of returning her home turf in Hardin County to practice. Emily Meyer still has one year of school left before graduation, but Bartling said both of them hope to return to rural areas to practice when they’re ready.

With this in mind, Bartling said she and Meyer got involved in the study to further their understanding of what they were getting into and why others weren’t following their path.
“To us, it was just an opportunity to better our learning and to kind of open a door that we would be going into, but just a little bit sooner,” Bartling said.
Peters was researching population decline in small towns when he came across the lack of private-practice attorneys, even in county seats where many residents go for their health care needs and other services they can’t find in their area.
Rather than just looking at the total population of counties and comparing it to the number of lawyers practicing there, Peters said they used 2022 Census data to find out how many private-practice attorneys are located in each county and held it up to estimated demand for their services. These numbers helped determine if a legal desert exists in a given county and how severe it is.
Looking at more than 2,300 counties across the U.S., the study found that 11% of rural counties are critical legal deserts, with the largest gap between lawyer supply and demand for their services.
One example Peters gave was of Lee County — Iowa’s only county listed as a critical legal desert — where he said around 30 lawyers are practicing. Based on the county’s town populations, employers and other factors, the researchers found the county should have closer to 55 lawyers. Lee County is a “micropolitan county,” Peters said, as it has at least one town of between 10,000 and 50,000 people.
The majority of Iowa counties in the study were classified as having average levels of lawyers or higher, according to the study, with 10 counties identified as having emerging legal deserts. Most of these cases are in southern Iowa, Peters said, where farmland is less expensive and areas are more impoverished.

Bartling said that many counties with legal deserts are clustered together, so those looking for a lawyer might need to travel even farther. This could be especially scary and difficult to deal with for those experiencing domestic violence and the like.
“If those micropolitans, even, don’t have enough lawyers, then that just puts rural counties adjacent to that micropolitan (at an) even bigger disadvantage,” Peters said.
It surprised Peters to learn this, he said, and another shock came when the team learned pay for lawyers in rural areas was fairly similar no matter whether they were practicing in a legal desert or not, and the real pay gap is between urban and rural practices. This shows that using financial incentives to move lawyers into rural markets wouldn’t be very effective, he said.
Bartling and Meyer also looked into existing policy to try and solve this problem and identified their own solution.
Finding solutions to fill the gap
Legal work is not the first thing people think of when they think of industry workforce shortages, Peters said, and in reality it is quite different from what is being experienced in the fields of health care and manufacturing, among others. There are surpluses of lawyers in some urban areas, and there is no federal push to address the issue.
South Dakota has seen success from a rural attorney recruitment program, Bartling said, which lets law students practice in rural counties before they have completed their schooling. The program has seen success, she said, but it won’t fit in every situation, just like other initiatives the team reviewed, like mobile legal clinics and external fellowship programs.
One program they identified as viable is a licensed legal paraprofessional program, Bartling said, where the state would allow those with legal training but not a full degree to practice independently in certain areas, like family law.
It would allow people from rural communities who have some legal training but another profession to fill a need without having to leave for years to get the highest licensure, and still be able to complete their other work when legal help isn’t needed, Peters said.
“I think it’s definitely up to states discretion how they want to implement it, but we saw that that would probably have the most impact, direct impact to the rural community members,” Bartling said.

DemasA barge that has twice sunk into Lake Michigan, has been successfully relocated, the Michigan Department of Attorney General announced Thursday, laying to rest years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings. 
The barge’s owner, Donald Lewis Balcom, 90, of Traverse City, pled guilty last April in the 13th Circuit Court in Leelanau County to one count of Water Resources Protection Violation for Discharge of Injurious Substances to Waters of the State, a two-year felony. The charge stemmed from an incident in November 2020, when the barge sank and released oil into Lake Michigan. 
Under a deferred sentencing agreement, Balcom was given until June 27, 2025 to relocate the barge to a legal location, converting his felony conviction into a one count of Watercraft Pollution – Littering from Vessel, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 92 days in jail. 
According to a press release from Attorney General Dana Nessel. On June 23, the barge was moved to a legal location in West Grand Traverse Bay and has been partially dismantled over the past week. It no longer resides on the state-owned bottomlands of Lake Michigan. 
“After years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings, I am pleased the barge has finally been moved and to announce the resolution of this case,” Nessel said in a statement. “We have made it abundantly clear that the bay cannot be treated as a personal junkyard. My department remains committed to working with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to protect the Great Lakes whenever they come under threat.”
While Balcom is entitled to a reduced sentence, the Court has yet to amend its ruling, according to the department.

(Photo by Mary Swander)Buggyland will never be Buggyland again. The New Order Amish bishop has lifted the ban on bicycles and a wave of motion has washed over us all.
For a hundred years, both the Old Order Amish, the more conservative sect, and the New Order Amish, the more liberal, shunned cars and trucks, sticking solely to their horses and buggies. The Amish drove two-seater and four-seater buggies, one horse or two. They also drove carts with plexiglass enclosures during the bitterly cold winter months. Often, they rode bareback down the road.
Many of the Amish horses were retired harness racing Standardbreds with sleek musculature. They rounded curves with speed and finesse. The horses came to Buggyland with names like Electrify, Speed Demon, and Devil in the Details, soon to take on more Amish horse names like Toby, Stormy, or Harley, adapting to the slower pace of life around here.
The Buggyland Amish also have small tractors and riding lawnmowers. They are not against technology. They are just against technology that will strain family bonds. So, they take the rubber off the wheels of these vehicles and drive on the rims. That way their teenage sons can’t skip chores and drive their tractors to town to hang out with their friends.
And as nostalgic as we might find buggies, you do have to feed and care for the horses, take the time to hitch up your rig, and often take your life in your hands at night when you hope that cars will see your lights and your slow-moving vehicle sign. Lights? Lights, you ask? How do lights work without an electrical system? The Amish often place a solar panel on the roof of the buggy, running a wire to a battery, providing power to red flashing lights.
“In Indiana, they can just hop on their bikes and zip down the road,” my Amish neighbors have complained over and over again through the years. “And all the roads are black-topped there. Here, we have to just ride in our buggies and choke down the dust on the gravel roads.”
In the Amish world, Indiana is the equivalent of California. Shipshewanna might as well be Berkeley, a progressive place where the rules are looser and the living is easier. On a drive through Elkhart County, Indiana, you might see Amish with gas grills and boats parked in the yard. Men might work in a factory instead of on a farm and wear running shoes instead of work boots. And, of course, they all ride bikes.
So, the New Order moved themselves a little closer to Indiana by allowing bicycles. And the Old Order was left to try to enforce the old rules. A couple of years ago, I watched those New Order bicycles begin to roll down the road, baskets and carriers hitched to the back, holding everything from groceries to babies. The Old Order bounced along in their buggies. About six months later, the bikes picked up speed. Wow, look at them pedaling now! They’re moving. Then I realized they weren’t pedaling. They were now riding e-bikes!
  (Photo by Mary Swander)
Soon, a local Amish man opened a shop, that sold e-bikes and accessories. Our city council adapted our light posts with plugs. The Amish rode their bikes downtown to recharge. Others bought self-charging bikes. I thought the whole endeavor looked like fun, so right about that same time, I bought a nice new recliner chair to crash in after I’d ridden my nice new e-bike. Only one complaint: coasting along the back roads, I wished for a little less dust.
It was a particularly dusty day when Leah Kauffman stopped by and asked if I could quickly run her to her in-laws’ house and back.
“I’m happy to do that,” I said, “as long as it’s a quick trip. I am really behind in my garden.”
Leah looked out on my weedy garden plot, her forehead wrinkling. Weeds were sprouting everywhere — in the walkways between the rows, around the garden fence, in the buckets I use to grow my potatoes.
We struck a bargain. I would drive Leah. On the way home, we would pick up her children and they would all help me in the garden.
Deal. Four children under the age of 11 tumbled out of my car and I equipped them with hoes, rakes and shovels from my garden shed/greenhouse.
Slam, bam. The children pulled the pigweed from the flower bed and hauled it to the compost pile. They dug out pesky burdock root. They yanked the quack grass out of the hosta bed, then mulched with wood chips transported by the garden cart. I wouldn’t have made that much progress in such a short amount of time if I’d hired a dozen English adults.
Assigned tasks completed, the smallest child stopped and looked at me. “Was Kann ich tun? (What can I do?)”
“You can help me plant that clematis that I bought,” I said, climbing up on a step stool in the greenhouse to give the other plants there an extra shot of water, a few drops dribbling down on his head.
“Getauft (Baptized)!” he said.
His older brothers were climbing all over my e-bike, feet on pedals, hands on the gears of the forbidden item.
Uh, oh, I thought. Their mother isn’t going to like this.
“Okay, boys,” Leah called them off the bike, and the boys jumped off immediately, their faces falling in disappointment.
We drifted into the house for a drink of water, Leah remaining outside to weed the herb bed.
“Whoa,” Annie, the oldest girl said. She’d discovered my new recliner and hopped in, instantly finding the control wand. “What does this do?”
  Electric-controlled recliner fascinates both kids and dogs. (Photo by Mary Swander)
I glanced out the window. Whew. Leah was well out of hearing range. This chair was electric and I didn’t see much difference between it and the e-bike. I could be corrupting these kids. But they wouldn’t be driving to town in it. And they were having so much fun…
“Okay, go ahead and press the top button,” I said.
The chair tilted back, Annie’s eyes opening wide.
“Now press the next button.” Ever so slowly, the footrest rose up.
The three boys were mesmerized. They jumped into the recliner and all four children held onto each other, giggling and throwing back their heads, their eyes growing round.
“Take it up,” I told Annie.
She’d quickly understood the controls. The whole chair rose up into the air, then down again. Then the back arched forward and back, forward and back, the footrest tilting the whole recliner into the air as if it were flying in space, the giggling rising into the stratosphere.
“Mom!” one of the boys called.
Oh, no, I thought.
“Mom,” another boy called. “Come here.”
Now, what was I going to do?
Leah was in the house. She wasn’t smiling.
I could be in trouble.
“Mom, try the chair,” Annie said, all the children scampering out.
Slowly, Leah sat down in the chair. Then Annie pressed the controls, and Leah’s head tilted back. Another press and Leah’s legs rose. A faint smile graced her lips. Leah relaxed into the cushions, the tension draining from her muscles, her body limp and loose. Her eyes closed. Her mouth dropped open, exhaling one long breath. “Ahhhhhhhhh.”

The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”

“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries. 
  A chart showing possible scenarios of increasing entrance fees at Yellowstone National Park. Graphic by PERC
The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, Congress approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”

Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”

‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.

‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a security hearing with the North Dakota Highway Patrol and Capitol Security to discuss the safety concerns of legislators after Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home.
Law enforcement arrested and charged Vance Boelter in connection with the crimes. Boelter is also accused of shooting and seriously wounding state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. A list of dozens of Democratic lawmakers, who were believed to have also been targets, was found inside Boelter’s vehicle at the Hortman residence.
During a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee last month, John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, told lawmakers the issue would be added to the agenda of the first meeting of the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee.

Legislative Council removed the home addresses of North Dakota lawmakers from their biographical websites immediately after the attacks occurred.
“I have had no great rush of people saying, ‘Put my address back up on the webpage,’ I believe once we probably have the time to catch our breath … that maybe we’ll open that discussion and we can make it optional,” Bjornson said during the meeting.
During each organizational session, prior to the convening of the full Legislature, Bjornson said Legislative Council asks lawmakers what kind of contact information they would like to appear on their webpages.

“I think everybody will take a much more serious look at what that is,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said she hoped to include the Bureau of Criminal Investigation in any security discussions because the assailant was dressed as a member of law enforcement.
“They were responding to a law enforcement person at the door, which we would all open the door, if a cop was at the front door,” Hogan said.
Sen. Ronald Sorvaag, R-Fargo, said he worries about his wife, who lives at his formerly publicized address, while he stays in Bismarck for four months during the legislative session.
“This openness, there’s just got to be some reality check because as that tragedy showed, we’re putting others at risk besides the elected officials,” Sorvaag said. “We can’t get it perfect … but let’s not make it too easy for them is what’s got to be important.”
Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of the Legislative Management Committee, said he hopes those discussions about security will point out “weak links” in the security of lawmakers and they can address them without limiting accessibility and transparency.
No date has been scheduled for the first meeting of the interim Legislative Procedures and Arrangements Committee.

In this July 6, 1957, file photo, New York’s Althea Gibson waves the winner’s plate aloft after she defeated Britain’s Angela Mortimer in the women’s singles tennis final at Wimbledon, England.

Althea Gibson became the first African American to win the women’s singles title at Wimbledon and became the top female tennis player in the world. Just six years earlier, she had become the first black player to compete at Wimbledon. 
Born in South Carolina, she grew up in Harlem, where she loved table tennis. A local musician invited her to play tennis, and she became so talented that a year later, she won a local tournament sponsored by the American Tennis Association (formed by African Americans), later winning 12 ATA titles in just 13 years. 
Despite her talent, much of the tennis world remained closed off to her. The breakthrough came in 1950 when tennis legend Alice Marble lambasted the sport for barring Gibson from the world’s best tournaments. The tennis world opened its doors, and Gibson became a Top 10 player in the U.S. 
In 1956, she won the French Open. After winning both the women’s singles and doubles at Wimbledon in 1957, she was welcomed with a ticker tape parade in New York City. She went on to win 56 singles and doubles championships before turning pro in 1959. 
Although she declared that she never considered herself a crusader, there is no question that she opened the doors for many others. She even tried golf, becoming the first black woman to compete on the pro tour. 
After she retired, she was inducted in 1971 into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She died in 2003 at the age of 77. In 2013, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in her honor.

Massachusetts would do substantially more to reduce carbon emissions if it invested in an electric regional rail system with 15-30 minute frequencies that enabled more people to take the train rather than drive.
The post Why the MBTA’s electric bus mandate is a bad idea appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE OFFICIAL POLICY of the Commonwealth, enshrined in law by a well-intentioned Legislature, is that the MBTA cannot purchase any new bus other than an electric bus beginning January 1, 2031, and the T is further directed to operate only electric buses as of January 1, 2041.  
These directives may seem far off, but in the world of transit operations and the time it takes to procure and test equipment and make it ready for service, and build the new garages necessary to house and charge them, these deadlines are imminent. They were part of a larger bill aimed at “driving clean energy” in the Commonwealth. 
The bus mandate is a laudable goal, to be sure, but one that fundamentally misunderstands the significant constraints that have been placed on the US electric bus marketplace. Those constraints place the MBTA, and every other US transit agency pursuing a similar policy, in the position of being forced to purchase the wrong vehicles at the wrong price at the wrong time. 
I am not opposed to the transition to electric vehicles, whether they are buses or private passenger vehicles. Indeed, I view this transition as a necessary, if not inevitable, long-term change in the way we power most forms of mobility.  
Many people are looking forward to a day when we are free from the negative externalities of the current fossil fuel system. Long-time environmental advocate Seth Kaplan recently offered his vision for a future in which electric buses also play an outsized role in stabilizing the power grid.  
I do not question his or others’ enthusiasm, but I think it is important for everyone to have a realistic understanding of bus operations specifically, and the larger landscape of the transition to electric power, because they bear heavily on whether such creative ideas are actionable ideas.  
Specifically with regard to Kaplan’s article, the notion of T bus garages serving as mini power plants misses entirely the way bus transit actually works. The buses he imagines sending power back to the grid during peak power demand hours will, for the most part, be in service during those times, taking people to their destinations. It is not realistic to expect buses to be sitting idle as oversized batteries. Most electric buses will be charged overnight, not at times of peak demand, and I doubt anyone is willing to subsidize, operate, and maintain massive battery storage units, if such units were feasible and available.  
But even if Kaplan’s vision could be achieved, there is a larger concern that must be understood: the underlying assumption that the Commonwealth’s current plan to transition to electric buses on a fairly rapid basis is something that makes sense in this moment, or in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The Legislature’s electric bus mandate, in its current iteration, is a great mistake.  
To understand why, it’s important to take a step back and observe the larger transportation decarbonization landscape. The focus on reducing transportation carbon emissions, a large contributor to climate change, has led to many positive initiatives, but it has also contributed to misplaced priorities and flawed policies. Notably, it has ignored other consequences of driving motor vehicles, and those consequences, or “externalities,” have negative impacts on public health, land use, traffic congestion, and a variety of other factors that make up our quality of life.  
Massachusetts’s over-reliance on electric vehicles as a transportation sector solution to carbon emissions stems from the mistaken assumption that the environmental damage caused by cars is attributable predominantly to carbon emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. This commonly held view ignores the great public health danger posed by all automobiles, including electric vehicles: the generation of particulate matter emissions.  
Particulates are tiny, often invisible fragments or particles generated by activities such tire friction or braking. For all their carbon emissions advantages, EVs will continue to emit particulates in the air. This comes primarily from non-exhaust sources: brake and tire friction, as well as road wear and re-suspended road dust – all of which are exacerbated by the heavier weight of EVs. In Greater Boston, these impacts are heightened in inner core communities like East Boston and Chelsea. 
We ignore the topic of particulate matter at our peril. We know from several studies undertaken since 2020 that long term exposure to particulates causes significant negative impacts on public health. A Harvard Chan School of Public Health study linked long-term exposure to particulates to a 15 percent higher COVID-19 mortality rate.    
Carbon emissions are bad, and they are an issue that has global impact as they influence climate change. Particulate matter emissions are also bad, for different reasons, and they have very specific local public health impacts. Any decarbonization plan that encourages more driving by EVs needs to understand that it is failing to address this critical public health issue.   
Mode shift (getting drivers to reduce driving and shift to public transportation) is a quickly scalable option for both carbon and particulate matter reductions. Mode shift is also largely in the control of the Commonwealth and its transit and transportation agencies, as well as state and local land use and housing policies.  
Mode shift requires more investment in regional rail — a revamped commuter rail system that runs on electric power and provides frequent all-day service — and the Greater Boston subway and bus systems.  
The needed level of investment, however, dwarfs what we are currently doing. Over the next decade, Massachusetts should be spending more on public transportation in Metro Boston than it spends on roads and bridges. That does not mean we should spend less on roads and bridges. It means we should spend more on public transportation, significantly more, in order to achieve long-delayed goals of electric, high-frequency regional rail, subway system connectivity, and accelerated state of good repair. 
All of this bears heavily on the state mandate that the T transition to an all-electric bus fleet on a fairly aggressive timetable. Many well-intentioned lawmakers and others see this as a matter of urgent necessity. They are wrong. There are many reasons why pushing the T toward a very expensive series of investments in equipment, and new garage and charging facilities, all of which are delayed, is a major mistake at this time. Here are three. 
First, the current and foreseeable landscape for US transit agencies seeking to purchase electric bus equipment is not anywhere near what it should be. Here is the dilemma. If the T chooses to use federal money to purchase electric buses, it cannot purchase any bus that comes from (or has parts made in) China. Yet these are the best, least expensive electric buses on the market today and for the foreseeable future. This China ban means that every US transit agency using federal funds is forced to purchase from one vendor, New Flyer.  
This is a classic monopoly marketplace, and you don’t need a degree in economics to understand that such marketplaces do not offer best-value pricing. At a time when the T should be maximizing the use of its financial resources, spending any money on electric buses until we can make purchases of quality equipment in a competitive market makes no fiscal sense.  
Second, most tailpipe carbon emissions are coming from private automobiles, not from T buses. There are over 5 million registered private passenger vehicles powered by internal combustion engines in Massachusetts (as opposed to under 200,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles), so you get a sense of the magnitude of the primary emissions source. Kaplan’s article rightly notes that the MBTA has already taken actions, including moving to compressed natural gas and electric/hybrid buses, that have reduced bus emissions by 90 percent. In this context, buses are inconsequential to the production of harmful emissions in the Commonwealth.  
Third, the capital funds that will have to be spent to meet the legislative directive on electric buses means that the most effective approach to mode shift — regional rail — will continue to lag for want of funding. At a time when the T has acknowledged that its capital needs are significantly underfunded, spending limited resources to support the acquisition and garaging of very expensive electric buses is an irresponsible use of that money.  
Massachusetts would do substantially more to reduce carbon emissions if it invested in an electric regional rail system with 15-30 minute frequencies that enabled more people to take the train rather than drive. The measurable contribution of electric buses to meaningful carbon reductions is miniscule. 
We should stop being beguiled by the shiny object of the electric bus and focus on getting more people to take public transportation. This was the explicit advice offered by Gov. Baker’s Commission on the Future of Transportation. We have never taken that advice, and as a result, we remain stuck with a transport sector decarbonization plan that makes no sense and will not succeed.  
Electric bus fantasies should not be a substitute for intelligent, well-informed public policy. The Legislature needs to relieve the MBTA of its e-bus mandate, and the T needs to start being publicly candid about how terribly misplaced such a mandate is. I know of no major US transit agency leader, and I know many of them personally, who supports a rapid transition to electric bus.  
This would be a good time to set a new agenda for transport sector decarbonization in Massachusetts, one focused more on achievable mode shift and less on a misplaced carbon reduction initiative that, if allowed to continue, will be highly expensive and largely performative.

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

Doctors knew when the outbreak had started — June 17, 1894 — but they didn’t know what had broken out. 
The symptoms of the many cases erupting in Rutland County that summer varied so much that they made doctors unsure of the diagnosis. A three-year-old boy, labeled Case 1, was a previously healthy, active child who developed a moderate fever and appeared to have indigestion. After three days, his fever broke, but he could no longer walk. After 10 days, he started to move about by holding onto chairs. Then, after three weeks, he regained full use of his legs.
Another child, a six-year-old boy, Case 64, had also been in good health when he developed a high fever, accompanied by vomiting. On the sixth day, he suffered paralysis in his right arm; the next day he could no longer move his left leg. Ten weeks later, he was no better — both extremities were still paralyzed and the muscles were weakening. 
But he was more fortunate than a six-year-old boy, Case 4, who suddenly began convulsing while playing in the street. The convulsions lasted hours. He also exhibited a moderate fever, rapid pulse and vomiting. The muscles in the boy’s neck and back became rigid and his arms and legs became extremely sensitive to the touch. On the sixth day, he died.
The alarming news surely spread more quickly than the disease itself. Newspapers carried brief reports about Vermonters who doctors believed had contracted meningitis. While the papers also covered a number of active epidemics, including smallpox, typhoid and measles, it wasn’t until late August that they connected the dots and reported that these suspected meningitis cases also represented an epidemic.
On Aug. 27, the Rutland Daily Herald reported that doctors believed an epidemic of cerebral meningitis, spinal meningitis and cerebro-spinal meningitis had hit the city and surrounding area. Over the past five weeks, the paper wrote, the outbreak had “been rapidly gaining headway until it has attained serious proportions.”

Fatal cases or ones leading to total paralysis were relatively rare, doctors told the newspaper. However, they noted that many of the infected patients suffered paralysis in at least one limb and “the recovery of the patients (was) doubtful and slow.” Most cases seemed to be spinal meningitis “or a disease closely resembling it,” the Herald stated.
In the same article where it reported that the probable cause was meningitis, the Herald relayed a conflicting theory: “From information gained from physicians in the city yesterday it has been learned that polio-myelitis anterior [commonly known as polio]…seems to be the disease of the epidemic.”
This second diagnosis ultimately proved correct. Although it was buried in an article that was itself buried on Page 4 of the newspaper, the news was earth shattering: Vermont was suffering the first polio epidemic ever in the United States. In fact, this was the largest outbreak yet recorded anywhere. Although few people at the time had heard of polio, the disease would soon become a global terror. 
News that it was polio that had broken out in Vermont came from Charles Caverly, a 37-year-old Rutland doctor. Caverly, who was educated at Brandon High School, Kimbell Union Academy and Dartmouth College before attending medical school at the University of Vermont, had recently become president of the Vermont State Board of Health. As such, Vermont doctors were required to send Caverly detailed reports of any cases they encountered of this perplexing and disturbing disease. Those descriptions enabled Caverly to diagnose the disease correctly as polio, rather than a form of meningitis, making him the first person to identify a polio epidemic. He communicated his findings to the American medical community
“Early in the summer just passed,” he wrote in the November issue of the Yale Medical Journal, “physicians in certain parts of Rutland County, Vermont, noticed that an acute nervous disease, which was almost invariably attended with some paralysis, was epidemic.”

Tracking the disease, Caverly wondered if geography might hold clues as to the source. The first cases were observed in the city of Rutland and the town of Wallingford. While most cases continued to arise in Rutland, they soon also emerged in other area towns. All but six of the reported cases occurred in the Otter Creek Valley, an area measuring roughly 30 miles long and 15 wide. The creek, contaminated with sewage and running at a particularly low level that summer, was a possible source. But Caverly believed he could rule it out. Most people who contracted the disease got their water from wells or mountain streams and springs. Similarly, “general sanitary conditions did not seem to have any influence on the epidemic,” he wrote.
Caverly considered whether animals were the source of the disease. He wrote that that summer, domesticated animals, including horses, dogs and fowl, had been dying of an “acute nervous disease, paralytic in its nature.” It was an intriguing idea. Subsequent research, however, has shown that polio only affects humans.
Polio didn’t appear to be contagious, Caverly wrote. He had received only one report where more than one family member had contracted the disease. But appearances were deceiving. It turns out that most people infected with polio are asymptomatic. (In later years, after studying more cases, Caverly came to accept that polio was contagious.)
Caverly and his fellow doctors faced a massive obstacle in understanding polio. At the time of Vermont’s epidemic, virology was in its infancy. The poliovirus wouldn’t be isolated for another 15 years. Researchers eventually determined that the virus is typically transmitted through contact with an infected person’s feces or through droplets from their sneezes or coughs.  
Although Caverly failed to determine the cause of the outbreak, he provided helpful demographic information that showed the disease, which is sometimes called infantile paralysis, doesn’t only afflict the very young. In fact, he found that 15 cases were reported in people over age 14, including one case involving a 70-year-old. His statistics also showed that males were more prone to the disease; females only represented one-third of the Vermont cases. Research has since shown that both sexes are equally susceptible to contracting polio, but males are at higher risk of suffering paralysis.
After the 1894 epidemic, Vermont experienced a respite, with few cases emerging. Then in the summer of 1910, the state recorded 72 cases. Caverly, who remained in his role as president of the Vermont State Board of Health, was again on the case. A leading authority on polio, Caverly investigated a large outbreak in Vermont in 1916, which saw 64 cases. That year, more than 27,000 cases were reported in the United States, including 2,000 deaths. 

In later outbreaks, public health officials tried to combat polio by quarantining people with confirmed cases. During an epidemic in 1916, New York’s health department put placards on houses to identify where families were quarantining. Photo via March of Dimes
In 1918, Caverly faced a new challenge: charting an epidemic of another frightening disease, a deadly influenza strain. Doctors had little recourse against the outbreak. No vaccine existed. They counseled bedrest and isolation, when possible, to limit its spread. That year, the new influenza killed an estimated 675,000 Americans. Among them was Charles Caverly, who died in October at the age of 62.
He only lived long enough to see the start of the enormous damage polio would inflict, and he didn’t get to witness the medical miracle that all but eradicated the disease. Each summer, parents braced for the arrival of polio season, when the disease always hit some part of the United States and spread overseas. Adults were also susceptible, including future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921 at the age of 39.
Fear of polio was part of everyday life. Public officials closed beaches, swimming pools and amusement parks in an effort to stop the spread. Parents warned their children not to drink from water fountains. 
Doctors found that roughly one out of 200 polio infections led to irreversible paralysis and roughly 5 to 10 percent of those cases proved fatal.
In the late 1920s, an artificial ventilator called an iron lung was invented, offering hope to patients who could not breath on their own because their chest muscles were paralyzed. The iron lung became the image many people associated with polio. Patients were slid into these cumbersome, sarcophagus-like machines with only their heads sticking out. Some polio patients required weeks or months inside an iron lung to recover use of their own lungs; others remained in an iron lung for life. The machines soon populated hospital polio wards — as well as the nightmares of parents and children.

Real hope of not just treating polio, but defeating it, arrived in the mid-1950s. Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine had started work on a polio vaccine in 1948. By 1953, he was so confident of its safety and effectiveness that he vaccinated himself, his wife and their three sons. Two years later, on April 12, 1955, the American public learned that Salk’s vaccine had proved successful in clinical trials and would immediately be distributed. Across the country, communities celebrated the news by ringing church bells. Newspapers carried triumphant headlines. The Pittsburgh Press declared simply, “Polio Is Conquered.” 
The polio epidemic peaked in the United States in 1952, with nearly 58,000 recorded cases. By 1957, the number of cases had dropped 95 percent to 5,485. By 1964, the number had fallen to 106 cases.
Today, thanks to Salk’s vaccine, which has been further refined, polio is largely a disease of the past. A global survey in 1988 found that there were still roughly 350,000 cases in 125 countries that year. Massive vaccination initiatives have lowered that figure to 62 known cases in two countries in 2024, or less than half the number of cases identified in the Otter Creek Valley in 1894.

With an increase in political violence across the nation, one worries what could happen in Vermont. Do our legislators need more security? Are our public officials at risk of attack?
The impulse is to focus on safety measures alone. But that strategy doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. Partisan leaders are quick to denounce the violence on the other side while staying quiet when faced with violence from their side. As long as leaders continue to dehumanize their opponents and excuse their allies, political violence will persist.
Support for political violence has recently surged amongst Democrats. A recent op-ed in the New York Times reported that “About 40 percent of Democrats supported the use of force to remove Mr. Trump from presidency and about 25 percent of Republicans supported the use of military to stop protests against Trump’s agenda.”
Robert A. Pape, the political scientist at the University of Chicago who conducted the survey, urged leaders to do more. “American political leaders need to cross their political divides and make joint statements (and ideally joint appearances).” It’s not enough to hold your own press conference. You need to hold one with your opponent. 
After the shootings in Minnesota, both the Democratic governor and the Republican president decried the actions of the gunman. Each condemned the use of violence in no uncertain terms. But together they did not stand. Had the governor and the president stood in front of the same podium and treated each other with basic courtesy, partisans on both sides would have seen that there could be an alternative to violence. 
Convincing leaders that it is in everyone’s best interest to share the spotlight is a big ask. Politicians in both parties score big dollars when they denounce their opponent as Marxist or Fascist or some other variant of Evil.
“If my opponent wins,” says one side, “you won’t have a country anymore.” “If he gets back in office,” says the other side, “you won’t have a democracy.” If the goal is raking in donations, these are profitable sentences. But if the goal is reducing political violence, those statements are as effective as using a chainsaw to slice butter.
The good news is that people don’t actually like violence. Assassinations and kidnapping tend to sour the stomach. Indeed, there have been cases in which a horrific attack was just what it took to get leaders to cross the political divide. 
After two women were killed by an assassin at two Boston abortion clinics in 1994, leaders from three pro-choice and three pro-life groups agreed to meet. The mediators set the bar very low: meet four times, in private, with no expectation of resolving the abortion debate.
The only goal was to better understand the reasoning of their opponent. Each leader assumed that at the end of the year they would go their separate ways. 
But that’s not what happened. Instead, one year turned into five and an entirely new predicament emerged.  The longer they met, the harder it became to explain why they were meeting. How could they justify spending so much time talking with their opponents? Didn’t their donors count on them to condemn the other side? 
Eventually they issued a joint statement, entitled “Talking with the Enemy,” published in the Boston Globe on the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. In it they described their initial concerns, their enduring disputes, and the fruits of their conversations. 
These clandestine conversations, they explained, “made our thinking sharper and our language more precise.” Through listening and disputing, they became “wiser and more effective leaders.” By avoiding “being overreactive and disparaging to the other side,” they became better at self-control.
And most interestingly of all, these deep deliberations did not change anyone’s mind. “While learning to treat each other with dignity and respect, we have all become firmer in our views about abortion.” What changed is how they thought about their opponents.
In the 1990s, leaders could afford to take five years to bridge the political divide. With the current levels of support for political violence, we don’t have that kind of time.
To our Vermont leaders in Washington and Montpelier, if you are concerned about your personal safety, consider making friends with your enemy. Find a topic that you both care about, such as providing for foster children or fighting malaria abroad
Schedule a press conference and let your defenses drop. Laugh with each other as you disagree about policy differences. Let the disagreements be the glue that binds your friendship. Show the world that politicians can have very strong differences about public policy and still treat each other with respect.
Epilogue: 
After their essay was published in the Globe, the pro-choice and pro-life leaders held a joint press conference. Assuming that only one or two journalists would show up, they were met with a room filled with reporters. 
The reporters had lots of questions about the process, how they learned to trust one another, and how they dealt with their disagreements. The leaders were honest about their enduring differences and their newfound respect for each other.
At the end of the press conference, they received a standing ovation.

One of the new laws that went into effect July 1 has to do with school safety protocols. The safety of Vermont’s school children is of the utmost importance. 
These new protocols ought to include regularly reminding parents and caregivers of Vermont’s law which requires secure firearm storage in homes and vehicles if “a child or prohibited person is likely to gain access to the firearm.”
The law, which went into effect two years ago, is still not widely known. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics has determined that about 42% of adolescent school shooters obtained the gun from a family member, mostly through theft.  
It’s not just an issue at school. Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. As you are traveling over the summer it’s important to ask how firearms are secured in any camps or homes you may be visiting.
Vermont’s secure storage law is a proactive step we can all take to keep kids safe and more people need to know about it. More resources on secure storage can be found at besmartforkids.org.

We commend the Vermont State Legislature for a job well done on H.480.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dorrine Dorfman and Charlene Webster: A provision in the miscellaneous education bill expands a Vermont reading law for the better.","This commentary is by Charlene Webster of Arlington and Dorinne Dorfman of Plainfield. Charlene has taught grades 3-6, special education and structured literacy in southwestern Vermont over her 40-year career. Dorinne teaches reading to grades 5-8 at Barre Town Middle and Elementary School, and has served as principal of Leland and Gray Union High School in Townshend and Champlain Elementary School in Burlington.


Although debate about transforming Vermont’s educational system has filled our news headlines for months, we are pleased to share that a small, but mighty provision in H.480 has expanded Vermont reading law for the better, effective immediately.
With its passage, now all students in any grade level (K-12) who significantly struggle in reading can receive supplementary reading instruction. This includes both public and approved independent schools. The revised Sec. 10. 16 V.S.A. § 2903, or “foundation for literacy,” guarantees additional instruction to all students significantly below proficiency in reading or whose poor reading skills impede school progress. 
In May 2024, Act 139 — an act relating to supporting Vermont’s young readers through evidence-based literacy instruction — fundamentally changed K-3 classroom instruction, intervention, assessment, and teacher training. Act 139 marks the moment Vermont abandoned unfounded instructional approaches that taught children to guess and invent instead of directly decoding and spelling the English language.
The law requires K-3 students to be assessed and receive instruction in the five components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Assessments must be valid and reliable, and administered following the test’s technical specifications at least once a year. In addition, the parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient must be notified. Some schools have chosen to inform all parents/guardians of their students’ progress.
Although H.480 does not require schools to assess reading in grades 4-12, many schools do assess these grades. For students found significantly below in reading, H.480 requires schools to inform parents/guardians of the results and provide supplemental instruction in reading.
Parents/guardians are often well aware of their children’s reading deficits. Schools screening the five reading components in grades 4-12 makes the best sense, since struggling readers can have these deficits no matter what age.
Only an education professional who is highly trained in evidence-aligned reading practices, such as in an Orton-Gillingham-based program, should administer screeners and interpret student performance. Parents/guardians can request all results of reading assessments the school has conducted over the years. This is especially helpful for monitoring progress and determining if reading gaps have narrowed or grown over time. 
We commend the Vermont State Legislature for a job well done on H.480, guaranteeing supplementary reading instruction in all grades for those with significant reading deficits. 
Parents/guardians with concerns about their children’s progress should contact their schools for reading data, learn what supplementary reading instruction is offered, and confirm that evidence-aligned teaching and testing practices are in place. Advocacy from parents/guardians can help speed up the process, from assessing the five components of reading to starting the supplemental instruction their children need to achieve reading proficiency.

The Fourth of July is when we celebrate Thomas Jefferson’s words that proclaimed the American state’s independence from England – on July 2 instead of the fourth.
While independence was proclaimed on July 2, Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence was ratified by the Continental Congress two days later.
About 13 years later, members of the Continental Congress drafted the American Constitution which established the principles that would guide the new nation and shored up in more detail what Jefferson meant by life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
While the Constitution failed miserably in providing those rights to all people — women, Blacks, Native Americans — the rights provided to primarily white men then were pretty special.
Those cherished rights include the right to free speech and to an independent press that has the right — even the responsibility — to question and to challenge our elected leaders.
Those free speech components are the backbone of the country, whose independence we have in recent days been celebrating. And as our nation has matured, those rights have been availed to all.
But there is reason to fear that some of our elected leaders, through at least their words even as we celebrate the Fourth of July, are trying to erode those rights. No example shines brighter than the Trump administration’s  response to press coverage of recent military action.
Most Americans, presumably, would still agree that it is not anti-American to question our elected leaders about whether their desired goals are accomplished when our immense military strength is deployed. It should not be construed as a slap in the face to our brave men and women in the military to ask such questions of elected leaders, especially when American lives and the economy are on the line.
In most instances, questions are asked to determine if our elected leaders choose to use the military in a proper and productive manner — and not to embarrass or criticize the military.
If they can justify that use of force and if the mission was a success, they should be able to defend it without attacking the questioner.
Nobody claimed attacks against the military when many criticized the chaos and deaths that occurred in 2021 during the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan when President Joe Biden was calling the shots.
On the other hand, when the press questioned whether recent bombings “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities as President Donald Trump claimed, he and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said to ask such questions was disrespecting our military.
“There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did and, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because your people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn’t successful. It’s irresponsible,” Hegseth said.
Trump said the pilots who flew the bombing missions to Iran “were devastated” by the questions because “they put their lives on the line.”
In another interview, the president said, “And they (the media) may be prosecuted also for having given false reports on the attack in Iran. They were given totally false reports. It was totally obliterated. And our people have to be celebrated, not come home and say, what do you mean we didn’t hit the target?”
The president and his administration even went a step further, threatening prosecution for reporting on an app that allows people to provide information on the movements of ICE as the federal agency conducts immigration enforcement. Even before the media reports that simply reported about the existence of the app, it already was in the public domain and popular.
Perhaps Trump and Hegseth don’t understand — but hopefully members of the military and the rest of us do and did as we watched recent Fourth of July fireworks shows — that to question our leaders or even their military actions is not an effort to disparage or disrespect the military. The basis for this questioning and the right to even lodge the questioning is, in fact, a display of one of the more patriotic actions we can take as Americans.
That is the guiding principle, the North Star, of what the founders had in mind when they wrote the Declaration of Independence and later the Constitution.
And surely the founding fathers would not approve of President Trump’s recent threat “to prosecute” the media for their reporting.
After all, to obtain and maintain the right to question our leaders is one of the reasons we chose to end our relationship with King George III on July 4, 1776, or thereabouts.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03095832/AP24187076228493.jpg,,,2025-07-06 08:00:22.911760

Morristown stone artist settles over damage to roadside attraction

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on July 3.
A local sculptor whose roadside artwork was destroyed when a commercial truck hit it three years ago has reached a settlement with the insurance company over the value of the destroyed stones.
In April 2022, the driver of an Isuzu street sweeper fell asleep at the wheel on Route 100 near Morrisville, crashing through the Phoenix Helix, a swirling stone sculpture built at the roadside of MyEarthwork, the home gallery of Morrisville artist Thea Alvin.
Alvin told the News & Citizen at the time that the driver had been working all night and was tired, was not injured and sincerely apologized, but emphasized the loss she had suffered in the incident.
“It was a very important part of my identity as a sculptor, as an inventor — defiant and strong and a little insecure, a little imperfect, beautiful and steady and heavy and profound but also carefree,” she said at the time. “When it was crashed into, it felt like my identity was broken.”
Stonemason friends ended up coming to her aid and a new Phoenix Helix rose from the ashes, but a battle with the insurer of her work was more protracted. Three years after the sculpture was destroyed, Alvin said she has finally reached a settlement over the value of the artwork and concluded a disagreement over how the piece should be assessed.
Prior to the final mediation session, she posted on social media that she was close to settling with the insurance company over whether the destroyed sculpture should be considered art or just a stone wall.
“I have stood my ground that art is art, even if it is, especially, if it is, made of stone,” Alvin said.
The settlement was reached in mid-June, but Alvin — after conferring with legal counsel — declined to share the specific terms, prior to leaving to teach stone wall restoration on a private island in Brittany, France.
Alvin confirmed that a monetary compensation was reached, though not for the full appraised value of the work. She also confirmed that the insurer acknowledged that the Phoenix Helix’s value was due to its status as a work of art and not just a wall.
The destruction of the stone wall hasn’t been the only time a driver has veered onto her property off the busy nearby highway; Alvin said an errant driver recently took out her apple tree.
Alvin is well-recognized for her art both locally and internationally, though she’s made more headlines recently for her efforts to preserve open space along the Route 100 corridor. She’s led an effort to oppose the approval of a sprawling new industrial park planned across from the Morrisville-Stowe Airport under Vermont’s environmental regulatory law and put her skills to use in the effort by building handmade dioramas to illustrate the potential impact the development would have on the land.

“There's a lack of resources for implementing the laws. There needs to be more people that have time to go do welfare checks and follow through on these neglect cases,” said the director of a Vermont horse rescue.

Two weeks after the state confiscated 39 horses from a horse farm in Townshend, all the horses are stable, but some have a longer “road to recovery” than others, according to Jen Straub, executive director of Dorset Equine Rescue. 
The two horses with critical condition when seized from Friseians of Majesty are still in a veterinary hospital as of Wednesday — a gelding with severe dental issues due to lack of routine dental care and a mare with an acute hoof abscess, Straub said. 
The majority of horses are healing from some combination of lice, mites, roundworm infection and a skin fungus called rain rot. 
“That’s all just due to neglect, not getting proper grooming and bathing, not getting regular care,” Straub said.

After the fourth and largest seizure of horses from the Friesians of Majesty horse farm in two years, Windham County State’s Attorney Steven Brown said the ongoing animal cruelty investigation is a “fairly unique case.” 
The horse farm’s owner, Rober Labrie, pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of animal cruelty and violations of conditions of release on June 18. 
The state is exploring options including a permanent or temporary order barring Labrie from possessing horses, Brown said. The state attempted to request that Labrie turn over the horses still on his property to a third party as a condition of his release at an arraignment hearing, but that motion was denied by the judge due to lack of authority to issue the order, he said. 
The first seizure in July 2023 has been adjudicated, and those 13 horses have been forfeited to be rehomed, Brown said. The second forfeiture request by the state, after 20 horses were seized in September 2024, is also still pending. The state also seized two horses from the farm in June of 2024. In the second forfeiture case, the state filed 16 misdemeanor animal cruelty charges under Vermont’s animal cruelty statute related to the condition of the 20 horses.
The state will file another forfeiture order for the most recent seizure to begin the process of finding permanent homes for the 39 horses, according to Brown. He expressed gratitude for the rescue agencies that have assisted the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department and taken in horses.
Since the most recent seizure, 25 of the 39 horses have been relocated from their first stop at Dorset Equine Rescue to the Gentle Giants horse farm in Maryland. They are “visibly looking better in even just a week,” said Lorin Grey, the director of growth at Gentle Giants.
“They’re starting to gain weight,” Grey said. “They’re out on pasture and have access to hay, feed, grain, so they are all doing well and settling in, and we’re starting to address any specific medical issues.”
Grey said the organization was contacted by Vermont’s animal welfare partners for help because some stallions needed “specialized housing and individualized turnout,” a practice of allowing horses to graze in a pasture or paddock.
Gentle Giants horse farm is “one of the only rescues on the Eastern Seaboard that are equipped to house a large number of stallions and a large number of horses in general,” she said. 
The Maryland horse farm also took in seven stallions after the seizure from Friesians of Majesty in September 2024. Those horses have all now recovered, but Grey said they were “several hundred pounds underweight” and many had “ongoing, longtime skin issues that hadn’t been addressed.”
The Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals took in six horses on June 20 after they were originally transferred to Dorset Equine Rescue. Peg Keyser, the society’s advancement director, said the horses’ body condition scores were between 1 and 2 — the low end of the scale. Keyser said the horses’ feet and teeth were neglected and their skin was riddled with ticks and parasites, and in at least one case “raging dermatitis.”
The horses have already seen improvement since arriving and are going through veterinary evaluations and refeeding processes tailored to the horses’ individual challenges, Keyser said. But, the neglect and malnourishment the horses experienced for an unknown amount of time has caused compounded stress and chronic health conditions that will likely have lasting effects, she said. 
A more efficient and effective system
Rep. Chea Waters Evans, D-Charlotte, said the previous seizures at the Townshend horse farm, along with the death of goats within her district in 2023, drew attention to the shortcomings of the state’s animal welfare system.
Those two cases prompted Waters Evans to cosponsor H.626, which was signed into law in June 2024. The law created a Division of Animal Welfare, a new governmental arm tasked with creating a more efficient and effective animal welfare system, she said. 
“There are a lot of people who were trying to solve similar problems in a parallel fashion, instead of collaborating together,” Waters Evans said. “Hopefully if we have a more streamlined system, we’ll be able to stop some of these problems before they start.”
Lisa Milot, the state’s newly appointed division director, said she does not have a formal role in the active animal cruelty investigation, but is tasked with creating a comprehensive plan to improve the state’s animal welfare system in the coming months. 
Milot said Vermont has lacked uniformity and a clear process for law enforcement entities in different parts of the state. There is a need to strengthen and simplify the process of reporting, investigating and seeking recourse through the courts in animal cruelty cases, she said. 
“There’s no real consistency in how the cases are handled,” Milot said. “There’s some large cases that have come up in recent years, and (the state) wants both a better approach to investigating and prosecuting them, but also to, long term, preventing these sorts of cases.”
Milot said animal owners accused of animal cruelty are still allowed to own and breed animals while cases are pending because of the presumption of innocence unless proven guilty.
Along with a general backlog of cases in the Vermont courts since the Covid-19 pandemic, Milot said animal cruelty cases can take years to complete because crimes against humans are prioritized over property related crimes. 
Horses and other animals are considered by the state to be “special property,” so animal cruelty cases are litigated before crimes related to inanimate objects. Milot said the “biggest thing that would help with rescues, with the state expense on these cases is speeding up the rate at which the animal can be rehomed.”
Milot said there is no state-run impound center to house animals during animal cruelty cases in Vermont, and that would be very expensive to create. Partner rescue groups must foot the bill to house, feed, care and treat medical conditions of seized horses before they are forfeited and can be adopted, she said.
Milot said she has been reviewing the animal welfare laws in other states, such as legislation to expedite animal cruelty cases and reduce some of the cost burden on rescue agencies. Her goal is to “come up with a plan and procedures that can help alleviate those sorts of strains, but without causing extra strains on taxpayers,” she said.
Straub, of Dorset Rescue, said there has been productive collaboration between her rescue and the state investigators at the Fish & Wildlife Department and law enforcement. But, she said would like to see more attention and investment in the state’s animal welfare system overall.
“There’s a lack of resources for implementing the laws. There needs to be more people that have time to go do welfare checks and follow through on these neglect cases,” Straub said. “There are a lot of animals suffering across the state, and it’s not being dealt with as timely as it should be.”
The Fish & Wildlife Department, the Agency of Agriculture Food & Markets and the Vermont State Police all declined to comment due to the ongoing animal cruelty investigation. 
Labrie’s attorney also said she could not comment while the case is active, and Labrie did not respond to requests for comment.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.

State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
 

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Mazza/iStock/Getty Images)A group of environmentalists have launched a legal battle to stop a logging project in the Sandwich Range of New Hampshire’s White Mountain National Forest.
The Sandwich Vegetation Management Project, which was approved by the U.S. Forest Service last year, will allow 638 acres in the Sandwich Range to be logged by private companies, reconstruct about 16 miles of roads through the area and authorize prescribed burns on 306 acres. The Forest Service has said that the project will help manage vegetation to provide a sustainable supply of timber for local economies and the burns will help diversify vegetation and wildlife. It’s one of several logging projects in the White Mountain National Forest, several of which are being challenged in court.
“The Forest Service in this project, like in recent projects, is flouting the requirements of federal law as they approve these significant logging projects across the White Mountains,” Christophe Courchesne, the attorney behind the lawsuit, said in an interview with the New Hampshire Bulletin. “And they’re doing less than the bare minimum required reviews of these pretty significant efforts that will really change the face of these areas for decades to come.”
The Sandwich Range Wilderness spans about 35,300 acres within the southern portion of the national forest. It includes Mount Passaconaway, Mount Tripyramid, Sandwich Mountain, several rivers, and about 60 miles of hiking trails.
A allegedly ‘shoddy’ process
In a lawsuit filed in late June, Standing Trees, Inc. — a Vermont environmental group that seeks to protect forests across New England — and attorneys with the Environmental Advocacy Clinic — a project of the Vermont Law and Graduate School — allege the Forest Service didn’t sufficiently prove logging was necessary in the area or go through the proper steps for environmental review and public input.
“If you go down the list of various resources that they were supposed to analyze, and you really look carefully at what they put together, what you see is a pattern of the Forest Service just concluding, without evidence, that the project will have no impact on those resources,” Courchesne, who serves as director of the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said. “And that doesn’t meet the requirements of federal law.”
The lawsuit argues the project runs counter to guidelines outlined in a plan for the forest established by the federal government in 2005 called the White Mountain National Forest Plan. It claims the project fails to comply with that plan because it doesn’t include any measures to protect the officially designated wild and scenic Cold River and will affect parts of the forest visible to hikers and recreationists in violation of requirements to not impact scenery. The suit also says the Forest Service failed to demonstrate that logging will help manage vegetation and won’t harm the habitats of animals in the forest, including the northern long-eared bat, a federally listed endangered species that lives in the range.










They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn't adequate.


– Christophe Courchesne


It also alleges the Forest Service plans to build four times as much mileage of roads than authorized in the 2005 plan by classifying the proposed road construction as reconstruction of existing roads. The lawsuit argues those roads have been decommissioned for so long that reforestation has occurred over them.
“The public should have a right to weigh in on these uses of federal public lands, especially, these really beautiful, important areas that have major species and other important water quality benefits and all these sorts of things that that the Forest Service was supposed to take into account,” Courchesne said. “And they really did a very shoddy job in analyzing these impacts.”
The lawsuit also accuses the project of violating the National Environmental Policy Act in numerous ways including by failing the so-called “hard look” test and not properly examining the impacts on forest health, climate, and endangered species.
“They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn’t adequate, especially given the types of information that they presented and the analysis that they did in that review,” Courchesne said. “So it’s not that they didn’t do any review, but the review that they did really fell short of the federal requirements.”
The Forest Service’s stance
The Forest Service has not filed a response to the lawsuit, according to online court records. Officials with the Forest Service and White Mountain National Forest’s Campton office did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. However, in a letter outlining approval for the project, Jim Innis, Saco District ranger at the national forest addressed public concern over the project, writing “The National Forest System is managed under a multiple use mission, which not everyone agrees with.”
“Public opinion on forest management has and will continue to be controversial,” he continued. “Federal land management policy can be complex and difficult to understand. My staff and I did our best to explain the ‘why’ of our management actions and will continue this approach for future projects. … I have considered public comments received throughout the analysis and balanced them with the best available science in making this decision.”
The Forest Service had three 30-day comment periods and held five public meetings and five meetings with clubs and organizations on the project.
After those meetings, the Forest Service excluded 50 acres of old-growth forests from the project, Innis wrote. He also said the agency consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which determined “the proposed project may affect, but not is likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat.”
Several contested projects
This isn’t the first time Courchesne and the Environment Advocacy Clinic have sued the Forest Service. There are more than a dozen logging projects approved or proposed in the White Mountain National Forest, and the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, partnered with Standing Trees, Inc., have targeted several of them.
“We’ve been very active in this space,” Courchesne said, “challenging the Forest Service and trying to hold them accountable for complying with federal law.”
That includes their lawsuit over the Tarleton Project near Gorham and Lake Tarleton in the western portion of the forest, and a lawsuit against the Peabody Project in the famous northern Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Those lawsuits are ongoing and revolve around similar disputes.
They’ve also challenged logging projects on state land in Vermont and sued chemical manufacturing giant Monsanto over its alleged harmful impacts on water in New England.
New dynamics under Trump
The logging projects have been ongoing across multiple presidential administrations. However, when President Donald Trump retook office in January, Courchesne said he noticed two major conflicting changes happening simultaneously.
“Clearly, at the presidential level and at the top of the agency, there’s a real imperative to get these logging projects going,” he said. “And there’s a real set of commands, through executive orders and other directives, to put more of these national forest lands on the chopping block, so to speak, for reasons that don’t hold up, such as the fact that we have a supposed emergency in the national forests in terms of wildfire risk, which is just not the case in the White Mountains.”
However, at the same time, he said that massive cuts in staffing and funding appear to have hamstrung the Forest Service employees’ ability to work on this quickly.
Trump has taken several actions aimed at opening up more forests to logging across the U.S. Late last month, he announced plans to end the quarter-century-old “roadless rule” and lift restrictions on road construction in nearly a third of U.S. National forest land, a necessary step to build logging infrastructure. Trump also instructed his cabinet secretaries to bypass endangered species laws and other environmental restrictions to allow loggers to tap into more areas. These actions follow a series of executive orders in early March meant to streamline timber production and bypass environmental protection laws on claims of national security and natural disaster risk.

To access, click on the player above.
At the Dutch Epicure Shop in Litchfield, Ber and Beverly Welp filled up their basket in no time. Dutch breakfast crisp breads — beschuit as they are known. Two “for now,” Ber says, quickly adding a Dutch breakfast cake and a box of the chocolate sprinkles known as hagelslag that the Dutch eat on bread slathered with butter.


“This reminds me from time as a kid,” said Ber, who grew up in the Netherlands.
Before they are done they will have imported meats, house-baked cookies and of course licorice — to take to their daughter in Alabama. The shop stocks licorice, an obsession among the Dutch, to the tune of about four-dozen different kinds — from sweet to salty, according to owner Wilma Joas.

It is a normal summer Friday in Litchfield County weekender country with a steady stream of customers opting for both Joas’ house-produced baked goods, chocolates and prepared foods as well as the hundreds of items on shelves and cold cases that line and cross the small store.
But for Joas, her current normal may not last much longer. She may soon have to confront yet another challenge on top of several she’s faced over the last decade or so.
This time it’s the Trump tariffs. It doesn’t take much more than a glance around her shop to see why.
All but a few of the products in her store are imported. Most are from the Netherlands with all manner of gouda cheeses, jams, crackers, snacks and of course speculaas — a classic spice cookie — and stroopwafels, which are a coffee-accompaniment wafer cookie with a melting layer in the middle.
There are also Indonesian spices, sauces and noodles — a longstanding byproduct of Dutch colonization of that nation. The rest are from elsewhere in Europe, mainly Germany — an array of mustards and pickled, well, everything. There are French cheeses and butter. And imported meats from all over.
Trump tariffs on the European Union presently are 10%, but are poised to go as high a 50% on July 9 unless Trump changes his mind again. He’s threatened to begin them sooner and then backed off a couple of times already.

Ellie Barrows, a helper at the Dutch Epicure Shop, peers over the cheese counter. All the cheeses are imported from Europe. Most are Dutch Goudas. She thinks tariff-driven price rises on cheese will be more noticeable to customers than those on other imported products because they are considerably more expensive to start with.

Joas isn’t seeing a tariff impact so far. But recently some suppliers began charging her for shipping where they hadn’t before. “It cost me $400 to get a pallet up from New Jersey,” she said.
But she thinks she will be safe even if tariffs kick in. 
“These are such low-ticket items that if it has to go up 50 cents, I think that people are still willing to pay if it’s something that’s so unusual that they can’t get anywhere else,” she said.
“Oh, yeah,” said Beverly Welp. Though Ber hedged a bit. “Depends on if it doubles or something. I don’t know about that,” he said. The couple, who now live in Bethlehem, used to drive an hour or more each way from West Haven just to buy what Joas stocks.
Ines Deseroux, who is French, has been coming to the shop for more than 10 years, first as a part-time renter in the area, now living full time in Litchfield for the past 5 1/2 years.
She was there for ham, cheese, house-made prepared food and Joas’s zucchini cake, a round cake covered in a lemon crunch glaze. Deseroux also often gets candy for her kids, European crackers that are generally unavailable in the U.S., chocolate, sausage, European butter and cream.

And if tariffs cause the prices to go up: “I’ll pay more for stuff that I can only find here, and real ham and real cheese,” she said. “I’m not going to be anti-American, but what she gets is very different.”
Joas is pretty sanguine about the future and has no intention of changing what she sells. This is what the Dutch Epicure Shop is about and has been for nearly 60 years.
“I can’t really do that,” she said, “I’m the Dutch Epicure shop. I’m the last Dutch shop within 100 miles. I can’t believe that a Dutch person is just never going to have anything Dutch again, because it costs a little bit more.”
And she points out, if her prices go up, most likely so will everyone else’s.
“I think the novelty of coming into a shop and seeing those things on the shelf is still what’s keeping me going,” she said. “You just have to learn how to pivot. And after being here all these years since 1967 — you learn how to pivot.”
Pivot — it’s a word she uses a lot.
“Pivot is a great word,” said Danielle Ruggiero, director of programs at the Women’s Business Development Council in Connecticut, or WBDC. “Pivot, nimble, adaptive. Those are all wonderful items to describe any small business owner as they go through their day-to-day.”
Ruggiero said the WBDC is hearing from clients that overseas price quotes now have variables in them based on shipping dates, but not about tariffs specifically.
“This is not unique to the Dutch Epicure shop in Litchfield County. It is happening across the state and across the country,” she said of the need to pivot. “These are not unused muscles for small business owners.”

Pivoting practically nonstop
Tariffs are far from the only seismic changes that have caused Joas to pivot.
A professional chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America, she grew up in the world of baking, which remains her sweet spot — pun intended — along with chocolate making. Joas’ parents bought the shop from a Dutch baker in 1967 when it was a couple of years old. Her father, who is German, was a baker. Her mother, who is Dutch, did the product ordering. 
When they decided to retire in 2002, Joas, at age 31, purchased it from them and came back to Litchfield after years working as a chef for hotels to hospitals, from Colorado to South Carolina and back to New England.
A number of headwinds since then have caused her to pivot. They’ve included Amazon, which made the nationwide product shipping the shop did no longer worthwhile. Twin boys, now 14, made for — well — more than what she and her husband anticipated in baby juggling.
“We thought, ‘oh, we can handle one kid.’ And then, surprise, surprise, here you go. You have twins,” Joas said.
And then there was COVID.

Wilma Joas is a chef by training, but mainly does baking at her Dutch Epicure Shop. Her parents bought the shop in 1967 and she took over from them in 2002. She has adapted to the times over the years, especially during COVID. And she’ll do it again if tariffs hit and to deal with chocolate availability and prices due to climate change. For now she’ll keep making her favorite mocha layer cake. Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel
Joas said she just kept going. “I heard that they started shutting stores down, and I just stayed open,” she said, telling her husband: “I’m going to work tomorrow. I’m not closing, because if I close, somebody might tell me I can’t reopen.”
It was just her. In at 5 a.m., baking until 9 a.m. and then handling the store all day.
“The store was slammed. We were so busy. Anyone who had a house in New York and a house up here came up here to stay permanently. So all my customers were up here permanently. Every single Airbnb was filled,” she said. “I had people who were buying half a wheel of cheese; they were buying whole salamis.”
Even with lines out the door at times, she shifted to close at 3 p.m. to give herself time to regroup and do all the cooking and baking that was needed. An earlier decision to do more prepared foods like soups and stews turned out to be fortuitous.
“Anything I made, food-wise, prepared-wise, was gone immediately,” she said. “Anything I put out, I sold immediately; literally anything.”
Including toilet paper, which she started stocking for customers who couldn’t get it.
Since then she’s navigated egg shortages and high prices due to bird flu, and ongoing climate-driven high prices due to problems with chocolate crops — both potentially catastrophic for a baker.
She’s downright calm when it comes to tariffs.
“If you’re selling a jar of mustard for $1.40 and it goes up to $2.10 it’s such a small increase,” she said. “It’s not like the car was $20,000 and now it’s $32,000.”
She said she’s set up her business model around, well, pivoting.
“I have a ton of people in the summertime with farmers markets. They bring bread to the farmer market, so I don’t sell as much bread in the summertime,” she explained. “So I just pivoted to something else, and I bought myself an ice cream machine. So in the summertime, I make pints of ice cream.
“I just found a way to have one piece of the business pick up where another piece might fall off.”
Another pivot point: in the aftermath of the popularity surge in the town of Litchfield during COVID, the area is becoming a hot spot for weekend travel — mainly from New York. In the past year or so, three new hotels have opened, along with a new event space for weddings and other celebrations.
The year-round population is stable right now at about 8,200, according to Denise Raap, Litchfield’s first selectman. But weekend visitors want food they can take back to a hotel room or an Airbnb, said Joas.
“That’s why I’m probably going to be pivoting into sandwiches or things they can eat on the road or things they can take back to their room,” she said.
Raap said businesses have always had to do that kind of adaptation. “The ones who are successful, always have to reevaluate their clientele and the ones who don’t usually don’t last,” she said. “We have a lot of longstanding businesses that know what they need to do in order to be successful.”
The Dutch Epicure Shop among them.

Wilma Joas is a trained chef, but baking is her sweet spot. Her father, who owned the shop with his wife from 1967 to 2002, was also a baker.

The next wrinkles
So Joas is already planning ahead, not just for the tariffs that may — or may not — show up, but for the who-knows-what.
She moved to the building next door from the original store about a year-and-a-half ago. “My plan B is I’ll probably cook more, or I will cater in this new store I have here,” Joas said. “I now have a restaurant license, so if I have to start catering, or if I have to start serving food, I have a little area where I could serve food.”
Chocolate, however, that will be a problem and one that will likely get worse, Joas admitted.
“I’ll just feature less things that are chocolate, and the ones that are, will have to go up in price,” she said. “I can see a time where chocolate is a luxury, and it’s not simply something you have all the time because you like it.”
Eggs may not be quite so extreme, since the bird flu problem is expected to diminish. But the pail of broken up eggs she used to get for $40 went up to $120. “Now I’m focusing on recipes that don’t use quite so many eggs.”
Most folks may have forgotten about drought and other issues that affected the California almond crop — the largest in the world — starting several years ago. Joas hasn’t. Almond paste or marzipan is a Christmastime staple and ever-present in much of her year-round baking.
“I remember trying to find buckets of almond paste, looking for different brands, anything I could do to have that in stock,” she said. “That’s a huge money maker for me at Christmastime. So you’re losing a huge portion of your income, and you’re not going to get that back. You can’t start selling Christmas cookies with almonds in January.”
It’s not an unrealistic thing for a small business owner to constantly have to adapt for all kinds of reasons, said Ruggiero of the WBDC. “There’s no shortage of situations for a small business owner where they have to stay nimble,” she said. “It kind of breeds them for these kinds of things like we’re dealing with in terms of tariffs.”
She recommends exactly what Joas is doing: hit it head on, get in front of it and put together a contingency plan.
While she’s calm about handling the impending tariffs, it doesn’t mean Joas isn’t annoyed about them. 
“These are government people who know the effects of what they’re doing I think. They know what a tariff is going to do. No matter how many times you say the Chinese are going to pay for it, that’s just not how it works,” she said. “I don’t think they really care that these small businesses are going to have to bear the brunt of it. There’s a bigger picture that we are simply not part of. We’re the aftereffects.”

Jamie Keppler has been coming to the Dutch Epicure Shop every couple of weeks for years and he will continue to do that if tariffs drive prices up. He says it’s like gas prices: “You can’t worry about what you can’t control.” Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel
Jamie Keppler of Morris, who says he’s been coming to the Dutch Epicure Shop every couple of weeks “for as long as I can remember,” was in the store for the second day in a row this particular Friday. His dog had gotten the original third-of-a-pound of prosciutto, so he was back for a full pound.
He says he often buys tarts, mustards, all kinds of condiments.
He doesn’t hesitate for a nano-second when asked whether he’ll keep coming if tariffs cause price increases. “Yes,” he says. “It is what it is. Just like gas prices, milk prices, everything. What are you gonna do? You can’t worry about what you can’t control.”
Gayle Carr of Litchfield says she’s been shopping at the store for nearly 30 years. She’s making a pit stop for licorice and candied ginger she calls “the best around.”
“I buy their cheeses. I buy specialty items. I buy bread,” she says. As for tariff driven price increases: “I’m willing to pay it because I am supporting a local business.”
And that local connection is also what buoys Joas, who said sometimes the constant challenges do get disheartening. 
“I have customers who come in here, and I know their children, and I know their grandchildren, and they’ve just been coming here forever. They have the same birthday cake every single year. I have grown men who say, your mom used to give me a cookie all the time,” she said. “It’s such a happy business, and I’m happy to come here every day. It’s really a nice way to spend your career.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wilma-7-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-06 05:59:48.563754

The site, pictured in July 2025,  is on East Main Street in Council Grove. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)COUNCIL GROVE — Two hundred years ago next month, a trio of white commissioners met with a group of Osage leaders beneath the tallest oak in a mile-wide grove here and, for $800, purchased safe passage and free use of the Santa Fe Trail for trade with Mexico.
It was a steal for the U.S. government.
The Santa Fe Trail was the route, scouted by trader William Becknell in 1821, that connected Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Most of its 870 miles crossed the length of Kansas, with branching routes in present-day Colorado or Oklahoma. The trail accelerated westward expansion, provided an American invasion route for the Mexican-American war in the 1840s, and was ultimately rendered obsolete in 1880 by the arrival of the railroad in Santa Fe.
Recently I leaned on the iron fence surrounding what is supposed to be the long-dead stump of that great oak, preserved under a kind of mid-century modern pavilion beside East Main Street, and studied the gnarled and knotted wood as if it were a map. Nobody knows if the stump is really from the historic tree that marked the location of the Aug. 10, 1825, treaty, but tradition holds that it is.
When the town celebrated its centennial in 1925, the tree was still living and regarded as the Council Oak. The weeklong event, attended by thousands of white people and a few representatives of the Kaw (or Kansa) Nation, featured fiddling and dancing, a reenactment of the treaty signing, and an airplane that dropped flowers on a newly erected “Tomb of the Unknown Indian.” The rock monument held the skeletal remains of a presumed Kaw chief who had been found washed out in a stream the year before by a group of Boy Scouts, according to a 1990 article by Timothy Fry. A band played a dirge as the body was carried to the monument in a military caisson draped with an American flag.
In visiting the alleged stump of the Council Oak, it occurred to me that no matter how maps are redrawn, the essential character of American power has remained unchanged in two centuries. Since the signing of the Council Oak treaty, political will has been wielded in our name to displace people from their homes. From Native Americans to migrants, the United States has routinely used force to remove or relocate individuals who have committed no crime other than being regarded as alien by the culture in power.
Such an assertion might seem provocative, but not to students of history. In “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country,” the late Willian E. Unrau talks about being handed one of those large maps that used to accompany issues of National Geographic (perhaps they still do, but I haven’t been a subscriber since Rupert Murdoch’s outfit bought the magazine in 2015). The map Unrau referred to defined “Indian country,” in 2004, as 56 million acres of mostly reservation land.
“Above all else the map provided evidence supportive of my own view that Indian country, at bedrock level dating back to 1825,” Unrau writes, “was simply a place, a physical location where the dispossession and suffering of one culture transpired for the benefit of another.”
The idea that we progressively pushed Native Americans from their ancestral homelands to ever smaller reserves in remote and harsh corners of the American West is not new. But the way in which Unrau describes generations of government policy failures that resulted in this diminishment reveals anew our susceptibility to greed, misfired policy and bad faith.
While the acquisition of land is a perennial lure for those who would abuse power, there are other motivators. These include fear, especially during times of war, and the urge to exclude others. These varieties of moral darkness are not unique to the American soul, but we have excelled at practicing them while simultaneously extolling our virtue.
Among the last great abuses was the imprisonment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II and the Eisenhower administration’s military-style deportations of Mexican nationals in the 1950s, but after a few relatively progressive decades we’ve reverted to our old ways and are again terrorizing migrants. The parallels between our treatment of Native Americans and today’s government-sanctioned war on migrants is striking, with birthright citizenship as a common battleground.
Native Americans weren’t legally counted as Americans until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. But because voting rights were controlled by the states, many were denied access to the ballot through literacy tests and other arbitrary measures. Not until the 1970s did the Supreme Court clear away the last voting impediments for Native Americans.
There has hardly been a treaty signed or a promise made to First Peoples that was kept by the U.S. Government, something recognized as early as 1881 by Helen Hunt Jackson in “A Century of Dishonor.” Migrants also face broken promises from a succession of U.S. presidents, from Biden’s clear path to citizenship to Trump’s deportation of those legally in the U.S.
The government’s willingness to honor its obligations appears largely related to the color of one’s skin.
In 1925, the West was widely considered to have been “won” by courage and resourcefulness by settlers of European descent. American power was celebrated by the citizens of Council Grove — and much of the rest of the country — as a near-absolute source of good; the nation depended upon westward expansion to fulfill its God-given destiny. Back in the Council Grove centennial days, Kansas was central to the American narrative. From the coming of Coronado with his (or Father Padilla’s) cross to the opening of the Santa Fe Trail to the last Indian raid, it was all part of the myth of the frontier. At Council Grove the last raid occurred in 1868 when a group of Cheyennes clashed with the Kaw Nation in a dispute over horses. Stories of that largely bloodless confrontation were told and retold during the 1925 celebration.
If you grew up in Kansas, you’re probably familiar with the themes that by 1925 had become state canon. Exploration and faith went hand-in-hand. The historical “Doctrine of Discovery” declared that any lands not held by Christians were ripe for the taking. The Spanish conquistador Coronado came to what is now Kansas in 1541 looking for the golden city of Quivira, guided by a native called “the Turk.” They likely made it as far as present-day Salina but found no riches. Believing “the Turk” had lied, Coronado had him strangled.
With Coronado was Father Padilla, allegedly the first to bring Christianity to America. Coronado returned empty-handed to New Mexico, but Padilla returned to Kansas, the story goes, to minister to the Wichita nation. Venturing against advice into Kaw territory, Padilla was killed. The Kaws say it is unclear who was responsible for his murder.
Coronado and Padilla are traditionally portrayed as heroes in Kansas lore, not as a failed treasure-seeking murderer and a religious zealot. The indigenous peoples they encountered are cast as liars, killers or children awaiting the word of God. Never mind these were members of fully realized civilizations with rich cultures and their own religious and spiritual traditions. My late friend and mentor Don Coldsmith recognized the hypocrisy in the conventional telling and, in 1980, published “Trail of the Spanish Bit,” a novel that flips the story and puts the First Peoples in charge.
Now, in 2025, Council Grove is preparing for its bicentennial.
Instead of a week of events, there is an afternoon of festivities, on Sunday, Aug. 10. Council Grove is a town rich in history — and in historic tree stumps, as Kansas Reflector opinion editor Clay Wirestone noted in a 2022 column. The ostensible Council Oak came down in a storm back in 1958, but the Custer Elm (yes, that Custer) survived to the 1970s and the Post Office Oak made it to 1990.
But history is about more than just dead trees.
Uncomfortable facts about our nation’s past are under increasing attack by the culture currently in power. A recent Trumpian executive order directs federal agencies to present a sanitized version of American history.
“Over the past decade,” the order reads, “Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”
The 1825 treaty with the Osage was certainly a milestone.
Similar treaties were made at about the same time with 10 other plains nations, but it was the Osage and Kaw peoples who had control of most of the territory crossed by the Santa Fe Trail. The Kaws signed on Aug. 16, 1825, at Sora Kansas Creek, in what is now McPherson County. But as Unrau notes in his 2007 book, William Clark — the famed explorer who was made superintendent of Indian affairs by Congress — had already obtained in St. Louis the cession of 20 million acres from the two tribes.
While the Santa Fe Trail enabled remarkable achievement for the dominant culture, it is an objective fact that it contributed to the suppression of others. The recognition that historical events may have had negative consequences is now contrary to the official policy of the executive branch of the United States, which makes an uncensored and inclusive discussion of those events more important than ever.
This is not meant to be an indictment of Council Grove’s bicentennial celebration. Nobody living now is responsible for the events of 1825, or even 1925. The city has the fine interpretive Kaw Mission State Historic Site, where visitors can learn more about the people for whom Kansas was named.
Charles Curtis, who lived as a child on the Kaw reserve, was the first Native American to serve in Congress and as vice-president from 1929 to 1933 under Herbert Hoover. An enrolled member of the Kaw tribe and one-eighth Native American by lineage, Curtis was an advocate of assimilation and the author of an act that called for the abolition of tribal governments.
There are 19 locations across town listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Council Oak. Radiocarbon dating on material found at an archaeological site nearby indicates human beings have lived here since about 5,500 years ago.
It is also important to remember that the Kaw were not, and are not, victims, although they have suffered like other nations from U.S. policy. They were forcibly relocated in 1873 from their reservation at Council Grove to Oklahoma, with tribal headquarters at Kaw City. They have a population of about 3,600.
In 2000, the Kaw purchased the land around the Tomb of the Unknown Indian near Council Grove and incorporated it as part of a heritage park. In 2024, a red boulder sacred to the Kaw was reclaimed from Lawrence. The rock had been stolen after the Kansa removal to Oklahoma and, in 1929, refashioned as a monument to European settlers. The rock, whose proper name is Iⁿ‘zhúje‘waxóbe, is now at the Kaw heritage park, within sight of the tomb of the unknown.
“Today, under authority of the U.S. Supreme Court, Indian country is what and where Congress decides,” Unrau concludes. “It can be a high-rise casino encompassing a city block across from a shopping mall. It can be a convenience store and service station complex along a federal or state highway.” And many other things.
In 2125, how will we look back on this period of American history?
Assuming there is still a functioning democracy — which requires more faith with each passing month — will there be interpretive sites dedicated to the mass deportations of the Trump era?
According to the NBC News deportation tracker, there were 55,764 individuals in ICE detention as of June 2. In the previous few months, another 50,000 had been deported. Those numbers, while far short of the millions Trump promised to deport, are similar to the numbers of Native Americans moved west of the Mississippi by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
There are differences between the removal of Native Americans from ancestral lands and today’s mass deportations, but both have required militarized force by the United States. Then as now, the ultimate fate of the displaced people rests with Congress and the Supreme Court. Birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, is under increasing attack by the right.
The weathered trunk of the alleged Council Oak offered me no clues to what the future might bring. But it did offer a reminder of the fluidity of current events, and how those of us whose ancestors were once immigrants are now clamoring to stop others from living on the land we stole.

What is this fascination that people have with monorails?  I can’t tell you how often people suggest them as “the answer” to our state’s clogged roads.
“Why don’t we build a monorail down the middle of The Merritt Parkway?” asked an architect at a recent meeting.  To my astonishment, such an idea was once studied!


As lore has it, back in the mid-1980’s local tech giant Sikorsky was asked by the Connecticut Department of Transportation if a monorail could be built and a plan was submitted.  Sure, such a system could be built, they concluded, but where would you put the stations and the necessary parking?
Since hearing of this white-whale of a tale, shared by Merritt Parkway Conservancy Executive Director Wes Haynes, I have been on a relentless search for details of the proposal, but I’ve come up empty.  Sikorsky has no record of the plan.  CDOT said “Huh?”
Digging through the archives of the Stamford Advocate I found articles from 1985 discussing the idea:  a $700 million monorail down the median of the Merritt Parkway from Greenwich to Trumbull as an alternative to Bridgeport developer Francis D’Addario’s idea of widening the parkway to eight lanes… or double-decking I-95.
Motorists were surveyed and CDOT apparently spent $250,000 for a study.
The amazing research librarians at the State Library dug through their dusty files and came up with a CDOT report from 1987 pooh-poohing the idea, not only on grounds of impracticality but because it would compete with existing rail service.  Heavens no!
In 1998 a monorail was once proposed for Hartford, connecting downtown to Rentschler Field in East Hartford.  It was to cost only $33 million and the cost was supposedly to be paid by the feds.  It never happened.  The idea was revived again in 2006 when the Adriaen’s Landing convention complex was opened, but again, nothing.
A pseudo-monorail “People Mover” system was built at Hartford’s Bradley Airport in 1976 connecting the remote parking to the main terminal, all of seven-tenths of a mile away.  The fixed-guideway system, with cars designed by Ford Motor Company, cost $4 million but never operated because the $250,000 annual operating was cost was deemed impractical.  In 1984 it was dismantled, though you can still see one of the original cars at the Connecticut Trolley Museum in East Windsor.
Whatever your fantasies are about space-age travel by monorail, let me dispel your dreams with some facts.
Monorails are not fast.  The Disneyworld monorail, built by a Japanese company, has a top speed of 55 mph but usually just averages 40 mph.  Even on a bad day Metro-North can better that.  The 3.9 mile long Las Vegas monorail does about 50 mph shuttling losers from casino to casino.
Monorails are expensive.  The Vegas system, opened in 2004, cost $654 million.  That’s why existing monorails like Disney’s have never been extended.
Monorails are not Maglevs.  Don’t confuse the single-track, rubber-tired monorails with the magnetic-levitation technology in use in Shanghai and being tested for passenger trains in Japan.  The Shanghai maglev can travel over 250 mph, the Japanese test trains have hit 374 mph.
No, monorails are not in Connecticut’s future and are not the answer to our woes.​",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/monorail-train.jpg,,,2025-07-06 04:59:31.585297

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Pedestrians and bicyclists along the Colorado Riverfront Trail in Grand Junction may have noticed something out of the ordinary this spring. In some fenced-off sections near Blue Heron Lake, 700 goats are grazing on an array of invasive species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, kochia, and Russian knapweed.
Grand Junction is using goats to combat noxious weeds to make more room for native plants like cottonwood trees and willows. At the same time, they are lowering the risk of wildfire in this hot, dry, high-desert landscape by reducing the vegetative fuel load.
“It can be hard to stop a fire where there’s lots of vegetation,” said Rob Davis, Grand Junction forester and open space supervisor. “If it gets going on a windy day, and there’s lots of downed debris …with 9 inches of precipitation a year, and high summer temperatures, the fire risk is high. Using goats for grazing is an environmentally-friendly strategy to help us reduce fire risks and knock down some of our invasive weeds.”
Plus, people out recreating enjoy seeing the goats, Davis added.

“There’s that added benefit that people just like it,” he said.
A goatherder watches over the goats and nudges them down the trail after they’ve sufficiently grazed a patch of dead or unwanted vegetation. Goats will typically leave the mature cottonwoods and willows alone. However, the city sometimes places a fence around young trees to keep the goats from munching on the saplings.
On the Front Range in Boulder County, the town of Superior has brought in a herd of 300 goats to graze on its open spaces for both weed control and fire mitigation. The catastrophic Marshall Fire in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the region.
Superior first began using goats in 2019, as a sustainable method for vegetation management. After the Marshall Fire the town “doubled down” on using goats for fire mitigation, said Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space.
Superior evaluates its open space properties annually to prioritize where to graze the goats each summer and winter, Clark said. Properties are monitored to gauge results before and after grazing.
“Initial results look positive,” Clark said. “People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural. The city later reseeds the areas with native species to improve biodiversity and reduce the number of noxious weeds.”










People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural.

Using goats for weed control and fire mitigation is not new. Lani Malmberg, owner of Colorado-based Goat Green, said she was the first company to offer this type of fire mitigation work 25 years ago. She and her goats have been featured in The New York Times, the L.A. Times, and other national publications. She now runs her Goat Green grazing business with her son Donny Benz and his fiancée.
Malmberg, 68, said she conceived the idea of using goats decades ago while studying botany, biology and environmental restoration at then-Mesa State College in Grand Junction. She said she watched how knapweed took over a cornfield while working a summer job in Colorado.
It occurred to her then, “Someone ought to run a business to eat the problem,” Malmberg recalled. “Now there are a lot of goat businesses” — and she has trained people at some of them.
Lockheed Martin uses 1,200 of Malmberg’s goats for fire mitigation at its facility in Littleton. Goat Green has done grazing projects for many Colorado cities in the past, including Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Castle Pines, Broomfield, Golden, Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.
“Over the past 30 years I have worked in all the Western states, doing fire mitigation in California, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Nebraska,” Malmberg said.
When asked where her company is based, she replied, “Under my hat — wherever I’m on contract.”
“Fire mitigation is a big deal. Open space (managers) are clamoring to get goats. People are jumping into it. It’s an alternative to machinery and chemicals.”
 More environmentally friendly than chemicals

Superior pays for the goat service via grants from FEMA and Boulder County, with matching grants provided by the town of Superior. The program is funded from 2025 through 2027.
Louisville has used goats to control noxious weeds for several years, said Nathaniel Goeckner, the city’s natural resource supervisor. Louisville contracts with Goats on the Go, in Boulder County, to graze 200 goats on open space around Louisville. Depending on the vegetation, the city also uses cattle for fire mitigation work, Goeckner said. Its grazing program is paid for with grants from Boulder County and a city sales tax.
Longmont also uses goats — though not for fire mitigation, said Jim Krick, ecosystem manager for Longmont’s Parks and Natural Resources. The city has brought in goats since 2023 for weed control — targeting kochia in particular, where it competes with native plants. The goats are brought in just before the weeds form and spread their seeds, Krick said. Longmont typically grazes goats on an acre per year based on its budget.

Grand Junction contracts with Ecological Grazing Service, owned by Jennifer Studt, who, along with her husband, raises goats and sheep on a ranch in nearby Loma. She hires a goatherder who stays with the goats the entire time, moving his small camper, and the goats, down the trail when an area is sufficiently grazed.
Studt says goats do particularly well here because they have a more resilient stomach. They can eat poisonous plants like Russian knapweed, which is highly toxic to most animals — but not goats, she said. And, whereas Russian olive seeds pass through other animals’ dung, which then gets repopulated elsewhere, in a goat’s gut the seed won’t survive, Studt said. Therefore, goats don’t spread noxious weeds.
Studt’s goats began grazing along the riverfront May 23 and will finish eating their way along the trail by the end of this month. They’ll return in late October, when other annual weeds begin to germinate.
“There are bucket loads of dead noxious weeds here,” Studt said. “And while goats will eat live plants too, they really like the crunchy, dead material — a lot of other animals not so much. Goats like a lot of roughage in their diet. We’re taking something noxious, poisonous to other animals and turn it into fertilizer which helps overall soil health — which helps the native plants come back.”
Using goats to reduce fuel loads, and invasive plant species is a more environmentally friendly method than using chemicals, Davis said. The Grand Junction program is funded through the city’s operating budget.
Although using goats doesn’t necessarily eliminate the use of herbicides, it reduces the amount of chemicals used in grazing areas, said Grand Junction spokesperson Kelsey Coleman in an email to Colorado Newsline.
The town of Superior contracts with Goat Bros, which Clark said offers educational days when the public can meet the goats close up, and learn how goats improve the environment.
“It’s an opportunity to get closer to the goats,” Clark said. “We don’t want people interacting with them, otherwise — they’re working.”

(Aristide Economopoulos/for NJ MonitorThere’s only one reason gun manufacturers are donating about $2 million to a state-owned shooting range that will open this fall 10 miles north of Rapid City. It’s good business for them. 
And that’s exactly why the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks, which will manage the facility, is wrong to welcome gun-industry donations. 
I don’t know if spending $20 million to build one of the biggest publicly funded shooting ranges in the nation makes sense as an economic development tool or not. But I’m pretty sure the four gun-industry manufacturers that have pledged $1.9 million in donations to the project — Smith & Wesson, Glock, Aim-Point and Luth-AR — think it will mean bigger profits. 
They will sell more of their product because their names are affiliated with this complex. That’s good news for them, but bad news for most everyone else. It’s bad because, despite the gun industry’s message that the more guns we own, the safer we will be, the truth is just the opposite. America is a country awash in guns, and all the research on gun violence shows that easy, largely uncontrolled access to guns puts all of us in greater danger of being a victim of gun violence.   
Gun-industry companies and groups give $2 million to help build state-owned shooting range

In April, there were 1.2 million guns sold in the U.S. in just one month, according to the federal agency that tracks gun sales. Imagine the profit in those numbers, and the lengths gun companies will go to protect it. More than half of all the guns in private ownership in the world are in the U.S., yet Americans make up only 4% of the world’s population. Ever since 2020, the rate of gun ownership in the U.S. has been on the rise. 
It should come as no surprise that we have experienced a corresponding rise in the rates of gun violence, especially in suicide rates, in that same time period, according to a new report on 2023 gun deaths by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Nearly 80% of gun deaths in South Dakota are suicides, and recent laws passed by the South Dakota Legislature — such as those allowing concealed pistols on college campuses and in bars — may add to those numbers.    
The majority of guns are purchased for reasons that have nothing to do with hunting or shooting sports, and everything to do with the marketing myths created by gun makers. Gun importers looking to sell huge stockpiles of cheap, surplus firearms left over in Europe after World War II found a wide-open market for them in America, and the rest is gun industry history. 
I don’t doubt that the Meade County shooting sports complex will bring economic benefits to local tourism and hospitality sectors, as well as gun and sporting goods stores. Certainly the gun safety training it provides for youth is a good thing. Maybe the range will boost the state’s economy and justify the $13.5 million investment in taxpayer funds it received from the governor-controlled Future Fund. Or maybe it won’t. All that remains to be seen. The only gun owner at our house prefers to take a walk on public lands and shoot at real pheasants, not paper targets, so we won’t utilize the facility. The projected annual cost of running the facility — estimated at $355,000 — might become a burden to the state’s budget that we can ill afford.  
I sympathize with Meade County ranchers and residents who oppose the shooting range. No doubt the sound of firearms discharging — from handguns to .50-caliber machine guns — in what is now quiet grasslands will degrade the quality of life on the surrounding ranches and small rural acreages. It raises concerns about the safety of their livestock and livelihoods, too. Plenty of state lawmakers seemed to agree with the ranchers, given the difficulty the shooting range had in securing state funding before former Gov. Kristi Noem circumvented the Legislature’s will.

Some state legislators say taking donations from the gun industry is bad politics. The critics are right, of course. The optics are bad. Legislators will appear beholden to gun industry interests in the future, given they helped fund a significant portion of a state-run enterprise. But here in South Dakota, the horse is already out of that particular barn. 
The gun lobby hardly needs to purchase more influence with the South Dakota Legislature. Virtually any legislation supported by the gun industry, and the numerous organizations created to promote it, is guaranteed passage in this state. The gun culture is so entrenched here that few legislators dare to question it or support common-sense gun violence prevention legislation such as Red Flag and Secure Storage laws, policies designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who are too young, too untrained, or too emotionally or mentally unstable to buy them. Instead, they vote to welcome guns in bars and on college campuses.    
As a South Dakota taxpayer, I’m opposed to taking funds from the gun industry simply because I don’t want to help them advertise and sell more of their lethal product. The 27 words that comprise the entirety of the Second Amendment speak about the right of citizens to “bear” and to “keep” arms, not any right of corporations to “sell” or “manufacture” or “market” them. 
It’s clear our government has a responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of people to own firearms. But as a country, we have absolutely no responsibility to help the gun industry increase its profits, and we shouldn’t make deals that will do so.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20230211gunOrama05-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-05 13:16:54.943710

(Photo by Taylor Balkom/The Columbian)CLATSOP SPIT — For most of the past two years, Jesse Allen has worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week operating a crane to move sedan-sized boulders miles out into the mouth of the Columbia River.
“You don’t want it to slip out and drop,” Allen said, sitting in the 240-ton crane’s cab Friday. “So when you grab a rock, you just think, ‘Yeah, that’ll work, that should hold,’ and you go for it.”
Allen and nine others at specialized construction firm J.E. McAmis have already precisely placed about 32,000 numbered stones as part of their contract to restore the half of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ roughly 6-mile-long South Jetty that’s battered by the Pacific Ocean.
Now, after six years of work and with just a couple hundred feet of jetty left to rehabilitate, the $172 million project is nearly complete.
The South Jetty functions alongside two smaller stone barriers in Washington. Together, they allow commercial ships to cross the notoriously dangerous stretch of water where 2 million gallons of Columbia River water crashes into the churning, storm-prone Pacific every second.
The trio of jetties work with dams and channel dredging to support an estimated $31 billion in goods that international shippers move on the river each year. Those products include Japanese cars, American grain and Canadian mineral fertilizers.
“The mouth of the river is the gateway to the entire system,” said Neil Maunu, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association, a trade association representing regional shippers, ports, businesses and public agencies. “It must function to allow the whole system to work.”
How the jetty works
Army Corps’ engineer and geologist Colter Bennett runs the jetty restoration project on the government side. As engineer-in-training Taylor Jacobs drove a beefed-up golf cart out on the jetty, Bennett explained the project’s history.
“The original construction of this was absurd,” Bennett called over his shoulder. “Trestle system with rail on top, and then a steam-powered train that would deliver the rocks.”
That 10-year initial project started in 1885, spurred by hundreds of shipwrecks along the ever-changing Graveyard of the Pacific.
Given that it’s battered by continuous surf, as well as periodic 40-foot swells every year, the jetty has needed about a dozen significant repairs throughout its life, Bennett said.
But the current project is the most significant and maybe the most needed.
“What we’re driving on, about 12 feet of it didn’t exist,” Bennett said, bumping down the new construction Friday. “Prior to this project, the ocean had beaten the jetty down to the point where 12 feet of rock essentially was missing through this entire section.”
Other sections had been knocked below water level, even at low tide. Raising the jetty by as much as 22 feet isn’t cheap, and it hasn’t been easy. Standing on Allen’s crane later that day, Bennett explained why the Corps is going to all the trouble.
“If this jetty was gone tonight,” he said, “within a few days — maybe less, a few tide cycles — the federal navigation channel would go from 40, 45 feet deep to too shallow for ships to come in and out.”
That’s because the jetties work to narrow the mouth of the Columbia, pinching the river and speeding up the current to prevent sediment from settling to the bottom.
Although the Columbia stretches to 10 miles wide at some points just upriver, the distance between the north and south jetties is less than one-fourth that.
An engineering marvel
After spending the past six years with J.E. McAmis working his way from a machinery operator miner to quarry supervisor at the firm, Cody Pierson now runs the jetty project for the construction contractor.
Standing 3 miles out on the jetty Friday, Pierson offered details about the team as his walkie-talkie crackled.
“We got three haul truck drivers, one loader operator, two people in the office, me, the crane operator, there’s a spotter and then that excavator operator,” he said, pointing at a giant excavator gripping a Volkswagen Beetle-sized boulder below.
The team works together as a single organism placing stones — some about as big as a 40-foot shipping container and weighing about 40 tons — precisely down to the inch.
The stones are dense Oregon and Washington-mined diabase, blueschist and greenschist. Their time underground is brought to an abrupt end when McAmis miners trigger explosives packed down drilled shafts.
From there, heavy machinery breaks them into chunks before they’re either barged by ocean or driven by truck to Clatsop Spit. Haul truck drivers then take them out on the jetty to Allen, the crane operator, who passes each off to the heavy machine operator aided by a spotter.

That last job is key to making sure this latest version of the jetty enjoys a long life, explained Bennett, the Corps’ engineer.
“Every stone is inspected to be placed a certain way,” he said. “The spotter works in tandem with the operator to inspect all dimensions of the stone.”
Each boulder must fit together snuggly. More complicated still, they must be positioned so their smaller end absorbs the ocean’s blows, and the larger more solid end anchors them in place.
“Every rock that’s put down is touched with survey equipment to make sure it’s within a tolerance,” Bennett said.
Workers make it possible
That high-pressure work is further complicated by the fact construction on the jetty must be halted each winter because of the location’s extreme weather.
Keeping up the work demands an intense focus and dedication from the deft workers that Bennett said shows in a variety of ways.
“They’re essentially just doing a puzzle all day,” he said. “Every operator I’ve ever worked with has said that when they’re going to sleep, they’re seeing this stuff.”
That’s true for Allen, who Bennett said is one of less than 100 people around the country who could do his job — a fact partly responsible for his compensation, which ranges from $220,000 to $250,000 a year.
Outside the crane’s control room Friday, dozens of pelicans swirled above, cormorants dove for young salmon below and sea lions gathered on the last 200 feet of jetty still to be rebuilt.
Allen believes in the work he’s spent the last six years doing, values the camaraderie the jetty team shares and appreciates the scenery. But with a family at home and a ranch to run, too, the 45-year-old estimates he only has another decade before he trades his current riverview for one that’s a little more relaxing.
“We just see all the guys having a good time enjoying the retired life fishing,” he said. With a grin, he added, “We’re thinking where we went wrong.”
The Corps and J.E. McAmis expect the project to wrap up by the end of this summer. Meanwhile, J.E. McAmis is already working on another sediment control project, this one just a few miles away on Sand Island.

Preston Street in Baltimore. (Photo by Elijah Pittman/Maryland Matters)When news headlines spotlight “squatters” occupying homes in Maryland, it’s easy to respond with punitive measures. But usually, behind every story of someone we’re calling a “squatter” occupying a vacant property is a larger crisis: rising housing expenses, declining wages, and a generational commitment to sabotaging our social safety net.
Squatting in Maryland isn’t new, but recent viral videos and sensationalized news stories have raised concerns about it as a growing threat to property owners and neighborhood safety. This framing is misguided. This isn’t about relative “bad actors.” It is about systemic failings forcing people into dire situations.
If we are to understand the causes for the rise of squatting, we must discuss the absence of affordable housing. The Maryland housing market is increasingly out of reach for low- and moderate-income residents. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a full-time worker earning minimum wage in Maryland would need to work 100 hours a week just to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. And it is even worse in Baltimore, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County, with decades of rent increases far outpacing wage growth.
Public investments in housing have simultaneously dwindled. Federal housing assistance has not kept pace with housing needs, and only one in four eligible households will get help. Maryland also has patchy eviction protection policies and inconsistent enforcement. When individuals slip through the cracks, informal housing alternatives, including squatting, emerge as survival practices.

To be clear, squatting is not a permanent fix, nor should it be glorified. However, we have to stop viewing it as an inconvenience to be legally addressed, and instead, tackle the source of the issue: inequity. A large portion of those seeking shelter in vacant structures are leaving unsafe housing conditions, fleeing domestic violence or are recently evicted. Some are young adults leaving foster care. Some are people with disabilities or unemployed. The commonality is affordable and stable housing.
Squatting is then the visible end of an iceberg. The underbelly of that iceberg includes systems flaws, including a stripped-down social safety net, defunding of mental health services and the criminalization of poverty. And Maryland is not alone. All over the country, municipalities are evicting encampments without solutions, states are passing laws to criminalize homelessness, and federal programs are both inadequate.
The erosion of affordable housing is not incidental; it is the result of policy decisions. Since the 1980s, Democratic and Republican administrations have prioritized tax credits for housing development rather than aggressively building deeply affordable public housing and have not established units for the lowest-income sector. We have a plethora of buildings developed through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), but none of the housing is operationalized at the highest need.
Maryland stands at a fork in the road. We can continue excursions in pathologizing poverty and depend upon law enforcement to make them go away. Or we can truly invest in good, durable options, such as expanding Housing First programs, establishing statewide rent stabilization policies, and building deeply affordable housing, not just housing for young people/new workers or market-rate apartments with several units subsidized.
This will take political will and courage. This will mean rejecting the notion that housing instability and homelessness are the consequence of individual dysfunction. This will mean accepting that housing, beyond being a commodity, is a human right.
We also must stop using the term “squatters” and implying that they are “stealing” homes. In most cases, these homes have been abandoned – some in foreclosure limbo, and most owned by absentee owners. The real theft is not around people working to survive; it is a lack of accountability for not honoring the public will to care for others.
If Maryland truly wants to be a model on this front, it cannot rely solely on viral fear-based slogans or strategic, piecemealed solutions, but instead needs an audacious, justice-based housing agenda that prioritizes that all individuals, no matter income levels, have a safe and secure place they can call home.
Squatting is not an epidemic. Inequity is the epidemic. If we want to stop homeless neighbors from occupying vacant buildings and homes, we need to give them real homes.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC03645-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-05 11:00:36.272081

But the myth of the loner, tough guy, and emotionally disconnected stoic is the topic of a new memoir, written by notable Montana author Russell Rowland, who also writes a bimonthly column for the Daily Montanan.
“Be A Man: Raised in the Shadow of Cowboys” chronicles Rowland’s life from upbringing to his adulthood in which he struggles with growing up, becoming a man and assimilating into the West, where every male must live up to that archetype, which Rowland said is an untrue creation of Hollywood.
Rowland grew up on a ranch in Wyoming, not far from the Montana border, before moving to Billings. His memoir paints a picture of a father who was aloof and an alcoholic, coupled with a mother with a fiery temper who would avoid discussing the painful parts of life.
That led to Rowland’s own isolation, alcoholism and a pool of anger that would burst out occasionally as rage. The memoir is part explanation, part outreach to let others — especially men — know the manly cowboy image is far from the truth.
Instead, the book also holds up the ideal of working together against a wide-open and sometimes unforgiving environment, relying on community and family, and developing a comfort with feelings. Rowland said those discoveries have taken him more than 20 years of writing and rewriting before finishing the memoir. Along the way, he’s also cut out several passages, rewritten other parts, making it less of a vendetta against the past and those who harmed him, and more about seeing the unreal expectations that the West places on its men.

“We also seem to have this idea that abusive men are incurable,” Rowland said.
He watched the transformation of his father, especially after he quit drinking — a story that replayed itself in Rowland’s life. That transformation that began with sobriety also led to deeper understanding about what is possible.
“This is to let other men and women know that I experienced and overcame uncontrollable anger,” Rowland said. “I wanted to explore where it came from, and why it seemed like I couldn’t stop.”
From a very early age, Rowland said he kept repeating a pattern of frustration, tension and tantrums.
“I had no tools,” he said. “It just didn’t go away. I would replay sh-t in my head until it just exploded.”
He lived in the shadow of his father, who Rowland said was “perpetually unsatisfied by his life” and parents who seemed to always be quarreling.
“My father would just distance himself,” he said.
Rowland’s mother is still living, and he said it was a challenge to write the stories honestly, as it was a challenge for her to read it.
Her reaction has been a mix of feeling horrible and not remembering some of the incidents.
“Naturally, she was concerned with what other people would think,” Rowland said.
Even though his father didn’t live long enough to see “Be A Man” make it into print, Rowland said he’s pretty sure he knows what he’d think.
“I think Dad would have had an easier time with it. He was actually pretty open-minded once he got sober,” Rowland said.
Both father and son trying to live a life of sobriety would sometimes lead to talking about the past.
“We had a lot of pretty frank conversations,” Rowland said. “I just decided the issues were important. The question of how to treat women and develop friendship with other men — we didn’t learn how to do that. We don’t do that in the West.”
What finally nudged Rowland toward finishing the book was during researching what has been arguably his most successful book, “56 Counties” — a travelogue and history of Montana’s 56 counties. It was during researching the history of Montana that he discovered something that struck him: Early pioneer men didn’t quite fit that pattern of stoic, hardened cowboy that is often portrayed.
“They were way more emotionally vulnerable than I had expected,” Rowland said.
Instead, Rowland blames a traveling writer from the East, Owen Wister, who wrote “The Virginian,” which became a runaway success more than a century ago, and the template for many cowboy or western-themed novels, movies and songs.
During research for the book, Rowland said he watched many western films — something he had done often. But this time it was different. He noticed different things.
“I was shocked at how often men would beat women on screen — just smack them around,” he said. “I noticed how often they weren’t married, or didn’t have a girlfriend. And, even when they would kiss a woman, they would just grab the woman and kiss them.
“Men didn’t know how to develop relationships not just with women, but with other men.”
He realize that this was the archetype or character that not only was admired by those living in the West, but the type of person many parents encouraged their young men to emulate.
“The cowboy myth is that if you’re a real man, if you got your sh-t together, nothing bothers you. But nobody is like that,” Rowland said. “We have one of the highest rates of suicide in the nation, especially men in rural communities who aren’t allowed to deal with their problems or what’s troubling them.”
He said that led to a life defined by one emotion, anger.
“I didn’t know how to talk about feelings,” he said. “I had to learn a whole new language.”
That came after he joined the United States Navy and got in trouble while fighting on a ship. The captain recommended he seek some counseling for his anger.
That meant confronting the brokenness in his own relationships, including being a combative if not abusive husband.
“It gave me empathy for my victims,” he said. “That’s not fun. That was tough. You have to realize that you hurt people that you were supposed to be protecting.”
Rowland hopes that by sharing his stories — even the difficult or unflattering ones — that it will give the strength to other men isolated by anger to seek connection and healing.
Ironically, it was working through the mythology of the cowboy that gave Rowland a new appreciation for those things in the western culture that are more savory.

July 4, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceApproximately 100 demonstrators gathered Friday in West Michigan to denounce the opening of the North Lake Correctional Facility, an immigrant detention center in Baldwin.
The detention center was opened on June 16, and, with a capacity of 1,800, the facility has been called the largest detention center in the Midwest, as well as the subject of several earlier protests this year. 
The Independence Day event was organized by local immigrant advocacy groups, including No Detention Centers in Michigan, Cosecha Michigan, GR Rapid Response to ICE, and Lakeshore Rapid Response to ICE.

The date was an intentional choice: July 4, the media release noted, is a day for “reflecting on freedom as an ideal and spending time with family and loved ones.” As such, advocates gathered outside the facility to highlight the apparent disconnect between Independence Day and mass incarceration.
Speakers used the event to emphasize the controversies surrounding the GEO Group— the federally contracted private company that operates the North Lake facility.
As the nation’s primary prison operator, GEO has been scrutinized for influencing immigration and criminal justice policy in ways that expand incarceration for profit.
During the 2024 election cycle, GEO and its subsidiaries donated almost $1,000,000 to political candidates, with around 90% of funds going to GOP candidates. 
In particular, the GEO Group has closely aligned itself with President Donald Trump. Trump’s first term saw 237 new contracts between GEO and the federal government. Furthermore, nearly 71% of the GEO Group’s funding is sourced from ICE. The Trump Administration’s emphasis on mass detention only serves to benefit the GEO Group.
Indeed, the Trump Administration’s budget bill allotted $170 billion to immigration enforcement and detention, with $45 billion earmarked specifically for detention facilities like North Lake.

The People’s Assembly of Detroit was unable to attend the event, but sent a statement that was read aloud at the protest addressing the June 30 ICE arrests on Detroit’s west side resulting in the arrest and detention of Marcos Fabian Arita Bautista, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras 
The group was formed earlier this year in response to the influx of anti-immigrant rhetoric and action and works to provide ongoing support, legal counsel, and mutual aid to families impacted by detention and deportation of their loved ones. Additionally, the People’s Assembly has established a network throughout the area, reaching out to schools, community groups, clubs, and churches.
In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, ICE described Bautista as an “illegal alien from Honduras who had been removed twice from the U.S.” 
Bautista first came to the U.S. in 2015. He was then deported to Honduras. He returned in 2018 and was subsequently deported for a second time. ICE also noted that, in 2022, Bautista pleaded guilty to driving an unregistered vehicle, operating without required financial responsibility, and assigning improper title in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. 
While ICE’s remarks provide a concise timeline of events, the People’s Assembly offered additional context. The group said Bautista was on his way to work June 30 when he noticed ICE agents were following him, at which point he returned to his home and family. Despite the efforts of neighbors and community advocates, ICE broke down the door, entered the home, and detained Bautista.
In recounting the events, the People’s Assembly elaborated on what this experience was like for the family.
”ICE didn’t care about terrorizing the children. ICE had their sniper guns pointed at a little girl’s bedroom window in the house with young children and Marcos’ pregnant sister inside,” the statement read. “ICE didn’t care about anything. ICE broke the door down violently and invaded the house without permission. ICE has not allowed him to speak with his family at all this week.”
However, the statement went on to add that the family and the community are grateful for the demonstrations of bravery and solidarity.
“This is what we all need to be doing right now,” the message concluded.  “We have to rise up together against fascism, violence, and racism. We have to show that we, the people, do not want more detention centers. We want our community to be cared for, and for families to be able to work, play, worship, and learn in safety and peace.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Iowa’s revenue shortfall becomes political fodder for 2026 campaign

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

The national total estimate for this category of resources on federal lands is about 29.4 billion […]","The northeastern part of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska is seen on June 26, 2014. Alaska figures prominently in a new U.S. Geological Survey report about oil and gas potential on the nation's federal lands. (Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)About half of what’s known as “the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable” oil lying below federal lands is in Alaska, as is more than a quarter of estimated natural gas, according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey.
The national total estimate for this category of resources on federal lands is about 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the USGS report.
Of that, almost 14.5 billion barrels of oil is in Alaska, with 14 billion of that amount on the North Slope, according to the report. Of these estimates of natural gas on federal lands across the nation, about 111 trillion cubic feet is believed to be in Alaska, with almost all of that on the North Slope as well, according to the report.
Technically recoverable oil refers to the amount that could be recovered through existing technology, regardless of economics. The category differs from economically recoverable oil. And the report only considers what is “undiscovered” — that is, what has not been drilled, but is estimated to exist based on the current knowledge of the geology.
The new report comes as the Trump administration is pushing for expanded oil development on federal territory in Alaska, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, both on the North Slope.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Department of the Interior, said in a statement. “Thanks to the USGS’s rigorous and independent assessment, we’re better equipped to manage America’s vast public lands responsibly while supporting energy security and economic opportunity.” 
The UGSG report, part of a periodic series authorized by laws enacted in 2000 and 2005, uses data from several past resource estimates. Those past recourse estimates generally used different parameters.
A 1998 report issued by the service estimated that U.S. federal lands held 7.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable but undiscovered oil and 201.1 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable but undiscovered natural gas.
However, that 1998 report considered only conventional oil and natural gas. It did not include unconventional resources — shale oil and what’s known as “tight” oil and gas, trapped in impermeable rock, as well as coal-bed gas – that are now produced through fracking techniques.
The new report includes those unconventional types of oil and gas.
The Alaska estimates in the new report are in line with other past USGS estimates for the state.
The most recent report on estimated technically recoverable reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge had a mean estimate of 7.7 billion barrels for the federal lands within the refuge. That estimate, in a report issued in 2016, excluded Native-owned lands and state territory.
A 2017 USGS report that focused largely on the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska had a mean estimate of 8.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. That report was specifically about the Nanushuk and Torok geologic formations, which lie mostly in the reserve but also extend to state lands. The Willow project being developed by ConocoPhillips is within the reserve and holds oil from the Nanushuk formation. The Pikka project being developed by Santos and Repsol, located on state land just outside the reserve, also holds Nanushuk oil.
The new report splits estimated Alaska resources by geography. While the vast majority of estimated resources are attributed to the North Slope, the report presents estimates for technically recoverable resources in Central Alaska and Southern Alaska as well. For federal lands in Central Alaska, which includes Interior and Western Alaska, the total for oil is 100 million barrels and the total for natural gas is 3.2 trillion cubic feet, according to the report. For federal lands in Southern Alaska, which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula, the oil total is 299 million barrels and the natural gas total is about 3.75 trillion cubic feet, according to the report.

At this closing event, a suite of eight vehicles parked outside offered a low-key intro to the breadth of EV possibilities.","The Bean Path in Jackson, Miss., wrapped its second annual AI Month in June with the dual draw of its first Electric Vehicle (EV) show and a Family STEAM Day, countering summer heat with cool science, technology, engineering, art and math-related fun at the Bean Barn, the second building in the Bean Path’s Tech District development.
The nonprofit dedicated to bridging the tech and digital divide in Mississippi focused on AI’s real world impact with talks, virtual sessions, classes and hands-on workshops throughout the month. At this closing event, a suite of eight vehicles parked outside offered a low-key intro to the breadth of EV possibilities. 
Bean Path founder and CEO Nashlie Sephus brought her own 2023 Rivian R1T all-electric pickup to the show-and-tell, pointing out features like the Gear Tunnel where she can stash groceries, a flashlight and speaker that can pop out, a spacious front truck, an air compressor on the back, and plugs and outlets all around. 
“I’m a truck girl,” said Sephus, a principal AI scientist at Amazon Web Services, and also a gardener and a frequent traveler between her Atlanta office and native Jackson. An EV that can haul stuff, make the distance on one charge and work nicely for daily use ticked the boxes. 
She highlighted AI features, too, such as Amazon Alexa, automatic raising or lowering depending on terrain, navigation aid (helpful with Atlanta traffic, she said) and automatic battery cooldown if it anticipates a stop to charge. 
So, it does the thinking for you? “It tries to,” she said. “That’s what AI is supposed to do.” 
In a state rating among the lowest for EV registrations, the show was a chance to chat candidly with dealership reps and private owners, get a closer look and get pictures, too.

Jaden Luckett, 25, was all smiles for photos, sitting behind the wheel of a Porsche Taycan brought by Porsche Jackson. Trying it on for size, he happily reported a good fit and pictured his 1-year-old, Jakari, in the back seat. Could he see one of these in his driveway someday? 
“First, I got to get a driveway,” he joked. But, this opened his mind to possibilities.
Porsche Jackson General Sales Manager Lewis BeCoats said, “This helps us help the community, to show what we have and then get other people exposed to fully electric vehicles, and the advantage they have in your life once you accept them in.” He brought the Taycan and Macan EV, and zoomed through a quick list of benefits, including the absence of oil and filter changes.
Range anxiety and charging opportunities were hot topics for questions. Travelers want to be able to fill up and drive all the way to their destination, BeCoats said, but “there’s not many cars that do that on gas.” 
Rest stops are also a good time to recharge the EV. “As long as you plan, it’s the perfect vehicle.” People are often quick to embrace the quiet, smooth ride and performance, he said. And, “for those who are green leaf people, it doesn’t put any emissions into the atmosphere.”

Mart Shearer’s “Use Lightning, Not Dinosaurs” T-shirt fit the occasion as he leaned against his small blue 2017 BMW i3 (his second EV) and talked up its suitability for an urban commuter. Fuel efficiency and gas savings started him on this road back in 2003 with a Toyota Prius Hybrid, and he had been looking at EVs since 2012. When an electric smart car turned up at the Mercedes dealer in 2019, he drove up for a look. It didn’t have much charge, they told him, but a turn around the lot was all it took. 
“Just in the drive around the parking lot, every problem with the gasoline version of the car was gone.”
A member of EV Mississippi car club on social media, Shearer sees a pretty rapid adoption rate for EVs for a predominantly rural state. 
“There are places like Jackson or Southaven or the Golden Triangle or the Gulf Coast, you see EVs everywhere,” he said, noting that even a small town Mississippi police department added a Tesla to its patrol fleet. “That tells you somebody made the calculations, ‘Is this going to save money for the public?’ and the answer is ‘Yes.’” 
Chargers will come, Shearer said. Jackson just added 10 new public chargers in June. “People look at public charging and we need more of it,” he said, “but the reality is, most of your charging is done at home in your own driveway, unless you live in an apartment.” 
“Cute, isn’t it?” Celestial Gordon-Griffin said, admiring the breezy blue and white Volkswagen Buzz, sporty Porche Taycan and more. “I’m always so in awe about everything that the Bean Path is doing.” 
She is keen to have her two teenagers realize the importance of tech. 
“My son loves to play video games, and I keep telling him if he learns how to code, he can build his own… I want him to just get bitten by the bug.” She hoped this EV focus could capitalize on his fascination with cars, plus, “Knowing that we’re really doing our part for global warming … It’s really good to see this.”
Making emerging technologies approachable and non-intimidating is key at the Bean Path, as is targeting those who usually lack access and exposure to them. 
“We cover senior adults, we cover our K-12, we also cover our mom and pop shops, our small business owners, our startup companies,” Sephus said. 
“We meet people where they are,”  zeroing in on their core interests to show technology links and spark curiosity. “That’s how we build our ecosystem here in Mississippi.”
Cameron Wilson, a volunteer with American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) was on hand as a ChatGPT coach, helping those at computer stations craft questions for generative AI to write a story, start a nonprofit to solve a community problem or start a business. 
“The biggest thing that I say is to not be afraid of technology, and to use it for positive and good things.
“The hardest thing to do is start,” he said. “Once you get the question in the door, and you see that ChatGPT really has the power to give you in-depth details, it’s just using your imagination and going from there.”
Brittany Myburgh of Family STEAM Day partner Mississippi AI Collaborative noticed the growth from 2024’s first AI Month, when many needed a basic AI 101 course, to participants’ growing confidence and curiosity for specific applications this year. 
“It feels like there is momentum. There’s a movement.”
Retiree Jesse Huffman was among those catching the wave. He learned about working a laser, 3D printing and drone flying at the Bean Path, and now enjoys projects on his own printer and flies his own drone. 
“There’s some knowledge down here at the Bean Path,” said Huffman, who helped himself to it. “I tell everybody, it’s just like a gym, though instead of exercising your muscles, you exercise your brain.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03154937/NashlieSephustruck1.jpeg,,,2025-07-05 10:01:42.247144

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.
The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.
The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”
One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”
“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”
While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.
An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”
The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.
The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”
More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”
The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.
Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.
“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”
Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.










“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like.”


– Nicole Cantello, American Federation of Government Employees


The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.
Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.
She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.
“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”
Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.
Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.
These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.
Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.
He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”
“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS_firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1.jpg,,,2025-07-05 09:03:50.043782

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.











America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Here, guests dance at a Senior Citizen’s Tea in Beaufort, S.C., in this 2016 file photo. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Ashley Phillips/Marine Corps)America is aging, but Maryland is aging faster.
Those are the findings of new Census numbers that show the number of Marylanders age 65 and older grew by 3.35% from 2023 to 2024, while the number of those under age 18 fell by 0.06%. Nationally, the increase of older adults rose 3.1% while those under 18 shrank by 0.10%.
The state’s population overall rose by more than 45,000 last year, the most since 2015. While the one-year numbers are relatively small, analysts say they continue recent trends: The country’s median age and the population’s share of older adults are both continuously increasing.
“Children still outnumber older adults in the United States, despite a decline in births this decade,” Lauren Bowers, chief of the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Branch, said in a statement. “However, the gap is narrowing as baby boomers continue to age into their retirement years.”
The number of states where those over age 65 now outnumber children has grown from just three in 2020 to 11 in 2024, though Maryland is not yet one of those states.
While the state’s 6.2 million residents overall are aging slightly faster than the rest of the U.S., some of the fastest aging is occurring in central Maryland counties, while some of the rural counties are seeing their populations age differently.

In Western Maryland counties like Allegany and Washington, for example, or Somerset and Talbot counties on the Eastern Shore, the 65-and-over population rose less than 2% year to year. And the median age fell or stayed the same in all four counties.
Among counties with rising median ages, Howard County saw the largest increase, going from 39.9 years in 2023 to 40.3 in 2024, according to the Census data.
Jie Chen, director of the University of Maryland, College Park’s Center on Aging, said the aging disparity between rural and urban areas stems from differences in resources. Most communities that can work to make themselves age-friendly tend to be in urban areas, she said.
“The rural areas usually have worse access to health care, housing and transportation,” Chen said. The lack of rural hospitals can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment for older residents, she said.
She said communities are aging primarily due to advancing technology and the state’s improving economy.
“People live happier and longer,” said Chen, also the chair of the university’s Health Policy and Management department. “It’s not a bad thing.”
But, Chen added, the declining birthrate among young people has led to the state’s disproportionate ratio of older and younger residents. She attributed that decrease in birthrate to cultural shifts and reluctance to start a family given the high cost of living.
Chen said there is plenty room for improvement in how resources are allocated for aging residents, especially in the health care system, to ensure aging residents can live happily and healthily “without sacrificing anyone else’s benefits.”

Benjamin Orr, president of the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said the trend is nothing surprising.
“The United States as a whole, our population is getting older,” Orr said. “Maryland’s population is no exception.”
Orr said the goal is for the state to have a healthy “working age” and under-18 population, but the state doesn’t need “explosive growth” in those groups.
An aging population can lead to slower economic growth, he said, and shifting government spending priorities as the state covers increasing health care and Medicare costs.
“We also know that people who are still in the workforce typically pay more taxes,” Orr said. “So an aging population can put further strain on government budgets, not just because they may need more services, but also because they may be paying” less payroll taxes or not spending as much.
Orr added that Maryland is already doing many of the right things to attract working age adults and young families, such as a higher minimum wage and good public schools.
The Census data also showed a continuing shift in Maryland’s racial demographics over the last five years.
Since 2020, the state’s Hispanic population has increased by almost 14%, while its Black and Asian populations saw more moderate increases. The number of non-Hispanic white residents shrank by more than 100,000 people, while the state’s Hispanic population last year alone grew by about 30,000 people.
In an interview with Maryland Matters, Bowers said the trend in Maryland also mirrors the rest of the country. Since 2020, the U.S. Hispanic population has increased by just more than 6 million people, she said.

When the online review platform Yelp added a “Black-owned” tag in 2020, it boosted the visibility of Black-owned restaurants in Detroit. It also caused their ratings to drop, according to our recent study.
Both local and nonlocal reviewers who showed awareness of a restaurant’s Black ownership rated restaurants 3.03 stars on average. Those who did not acknowledge Black ownership gave a rating of 3.78 stars on average. The tag seems to have caused the average rating to drop by attracting more reviewers who were aware of Black ownership.
 Why it matters

Technology companies often introduce new features and tools to influence user behavior and make their platforms more usable.
Although Yelp intended to support Black communities with the Black-owned tag, the design intervention was harmful to Black restaurant owners in Detroit because Yelp failed to consider platform and community-based factors that significantly shape user interactions.
Yelp’s user base is predominantly white, educated and affluent. Making Detroit’s Black-owned restaurants more visible to Yelp users may have amplified cross-cultural interactions and frictions. For example, non-Black users sometimes mentioned “slower” and “rude” service as justifications for lower ratings. Close readings of these reviews hinted at intercultural and communicative clashes.
And even businesses that don’t select the tag are identified within searches as Black-owned, based on user reviews and relevant links. Yelp doesn’t provide a way for the business to opt out of these search results.
 How we did our work

To examine the local impacts of Yelp’s Black-owned tag, we collected over 250,000 Yelp reviews of Black- and non-Black-owned restaurants in Detroit and Los Angeles.
We identified Black-owned restaurants through community-sourced lists for Detroit and Los Angeles and then generated a random sample for the non-Black-owned restaurants.
We then identified reviews that explicitly noted “Black ownership” for closer analysis.
Detroit’s Black-owned businesses saw a greater loss in business compared with “ownership-unreported” restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means they also potentially had more to gain from the new tag.
We found the awareness of Black ownership on Yelp significantly increased following Yelp’s addition of the Black-owned tag in June 2020. A year after the tag was added, reviews in Detroit mentioned Black ownership 4.3% more often than a year before it was rolled out.
﻿
Detroit Black-owned restaurants also saw a small temporary spike in their number of reviews, largely around the time Yelp added the Black-owned tag. At the same time, the restaurants’ average star ratings dropped from 3.91 to 3.88. In contrast, non-Black-owned restaurants’ ratings stayed relatively steady at 3.90.
This metric is an aggregate of all Detroit restaurants’ Yelp reviews over their entire existence, so a .03-star rating change is small but significant.
Even minor changes to star ratings affect the number of diners restaurants attract, their earning potential and the likelihood they will sell out of food.
Adding obstacles in digital platforms serves to reproduce and amplify inequalities these businesses already face, rather than alleviate them. For example, Black-owned businesses have a harder time getting loans and are relatively underrepresented in Michigan as a whole.
These findings may seem surprising given that Detroit is a majority Black city. However, Black users on Yelp are a minority. Keeping in mind the skewed user base of Yelp, we hypothesize the lower reviews for businesses featuring a Black-owned tag reflect existing racial and digital divides in the city.
﻿
Generally, our study provides additional evidence that digital interventions are not “one-size-fits-all,” nor is digital visibility inherently positive for all businesses.
The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Department of Commerce’s announcement that it will withdraw from an agreement with Mexico controlling tomato imports is being applauded by Florida lawmakers, who say it will allow Florida and other U.S. farmers to catch up to what the agency has labeled “unfairly produced Mexican imports.” 
But the proposal is fiercely opposed by lawmakers in Arizona and Texas, who claim the tariff being placed on Mexican tomatoes will harm their own economies and provide consumers with less choice and higher prices.
There’s no question that right now the winners in this situation are Florida tomato growers, who for years have been calling upon the Commerce Department to terminate the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement (TSA).
They contend that growers in Mexico have been selling their products at below U.S. market prices — a practice known as “dumping.” The Commerce Department’s decision, announced in April, means there will soon be a 17.09% tariff on Mexican tomatoes, which now dominate the U.S. market.
“The termination of the suspension agreement will allow U.S. tomato growers to compete fairly in the marketplace,” reads a letter penned by Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody and a dozen Florida Republican U.S. House members upon the announcement that the TSA will be terminated.
“This has been a priority of ours for years in Florida,” added North Central Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack in a separate statement. “For half a decade now, our producers have been subject to an unfair marketplace. In the past five years alone, Mexican tomato producers have violated the suspension agreement over 100 times. The economic impact of these violations has been catastrophic on our domestic tomato producers.”
No one disputes that the industry isn’t what it once was in the Sunshine State. Industry officials observe that going back to when the first Tomato Suspension Agreement was reached in the mid-1990s, there were almost 300 tomato producers in Florida. Now they say, there’s just a few more than 30.

“There have been over 100 incidents documented of violations by the Mexicans by the Commerce Department, so this is just a reoccurring problem that has devastated our industry,” said Tony DiMare, president of DiMare Fresh, a produce repacking and distributing company that started business in Boston 97 years ago and has maintained shipping operations in both California and Florida for decades.
In 2023, Florida produced $494 million of fresh market tomatoes, according to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.  That’s second only to California in the U.S. However, the Golden State tomatoes are primarily used for processing into products like ketchup, tomato paste and other sauces, whereas most of Florida’s tomato crops are for fresh market consumption.
Although the Commerce Department’s decision to kill the TSA is a welcome boost for tomato growers in Florida, Georgia, and other states in the South that grow tomatoes, it’s been denounced elsewhere, specifically Arizona and Texas. U.S. importers there they say the tariffs will result in higher costs for them, leading to higher prices for consumers.
Last month, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a resolution encouraging the Department of Commerce to maintain the existing TSA rather than terminate it. In April, Arizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego sent his own letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling upon him to keep the suspension agreement in place.
“The result of terminating this agreement will be higher prices for American families, few options at the grocery store, and fewer American jobs. Indeed, studies show that families could see tomato prices rise by an average of 50% if your Department does not reverse course,” Sen. Gallego wrote.
Officials in those states also cite an economic analysis from Texas A&M University, published earlier this year, estimating the direct and indirect economic benefits associated with the import and sale of Mexican fresh tomatoes in the U.S. at $8.33 billion, with fresh tomato imports supporting more than 46,000 full- and part-time jobs across the United States.
Robert Guenther, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange (FTE), says that the termination of the TSA will allow U.S. growers to stay in business, keep people employed, and save family farms. And he insists that consumers won’t be hit with higher prices.
“We do not expect any significant changes with retail prices for consumers with the termination of the agreement,” he told NPR last month.
DiMare noted that when the TSA was terminated for four months in 2019, “prices actually went down at that period of time.” And he rejects terming the penalty on Mexican tomatoes a tariff. He insists it’s an anti-dumping penalty for violating U.S. trade law.
“When we negotiate all of these fair trade agreements, there are parameters,” he said. “There are guidelines with which trading countries have to comply, and if those guidelines are not adhered to and rules are broken, there are penalties. And the penalties in this case for numerous years of violations of adhering to the minimum reference price is the anti-dumping duties.”
 The greenhouse revolution
The first Tomato Suspension Agreement between the United States and Mexico was enacted on Nov. 1, 1996, nearly three years after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) began. The rules evolved following an antidumping investigation aimed at detecting whether fresh tomatoes from Mexico were being sold at less than fair market value.
Under the ’96 TSA, Mexican producers agreed to sell fresh tomatoes in the United States at set reference prices, with the U.S. suspending the anti-dumping investigation. Since then, revised suspension agreements were reached in 2002, 2008, 2013, and most recently on Sept. 19, 2019.
In 2023, FTE, the Florida exchange, asked the Department of Commerce to terminate the 2019 agreement, saying lingering loopholes remained a problem.
“It’s become clear that these agreements are simply not enforceable, at least when it comes to the tomato trade with Mexico,” said Michael Schadler, then-executive vice president of the FTE. “Suspension agreements might be an effective tool for products that can be kept in storage until market conditions improve but, for highly perishable items like fresh tomatoes, there is just too much incentive to evade the reference prices when markets are oversupplied.”
However, representatives from other parts of the country argue the tomato market has evolved since the mid 1990s, when the first suspension agreement went into effect. Mexican imports have superseded Florida’s home-grown tomatoes because of what they call the “greenhouse revolution” — a new way of farming embraced by Mexican, Canadian, and some U.S. tomato growers, but not in Florida.
By the early 2020s, greenhouse tomatoes represented 60% of the total fresh tomato import volume, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). By investing in greenhouse technology, Mexican growers have been able to grow specialty tomatoes versus the mainly round tomatoes produced in Florida, said Skip Hulett, chief legal officer of NatureSweet, a Texas company that grows and sells greenhouse tomatoes in Mexico and the United States.
“The market has evolved dramatically since 1995-1996, and so consumers now expect the greenhouse-grown vine-ripe varieties, like the grape and the cherry, many of which didn’t exist in the ’90s,” he said.
“The domestic growers who petitioned Commerce for duties have failed to innovate, growing what in the industry are called ‘gas green tomatoes’ or round tomatoes that are picked green and then induced to turn a pale red after being placed in gas rooms and exposed to ethylene gas,” the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas says in a press release. “This kind of tomato has lost market share as consumers and restaurants have shifted to tomato varieties that naturally ripen on the plant, just like in nature, with a natural deep red color and superior flavor.”
DiMare objects to that claim.
“Yes, the Mexican industry has shifted their way of growing to a greenhouse product, but the actual production of the type of tomatoes is the same, whether it’s greenhouse produced or open field produced,” he said. “A round tomato is a round tomato. A Roma tomato is a Roma tomato. And we all share and compete at times in the marketplace with our products.”
 A matter of taste
William Alexander is the author of 2022’s “Ten Tomatoes that Changed the World,” a history of the tomato. He argues the problem with Florida tomatoes is that they’re “not bred to taste good.”
“These are green and rock hard and they’re bred for all kinds of things — to look pretty, to look fresh after they’re sliced, to look exactly the right size to withstand all of the horrible weather that you can have in Florida, and they’re not able to do all of that and also to breed for flavor,” he told the Phoenix.
Alexander recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, contending that the “last thing that American consumers need is a revitalization of Florida’s withering tomato industry.”
Florida’s natural environment isn’t conducive to producing great tomatoes, Alexander says, referring to the fact that they’re grown in sandy soil. “That sand never freezes, unlike a New Jersey field, and so it never kills off things like nematodes” he said.
For his part, Robert Guenther of the Florida Tomato Exchange told NPR recently that “there are no differences between quality, freshness, taste of tomatoes.”
With the clock ticking before the TSA is officially terminated, the lobbying is expected to prove intense on both sides of the issue. Whether that will result in a higher price of tomatoes is unclear.
“We certainly anticipate that if the tariffs do go into effect,” said Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Alliance, a membership trade association representing greenhouse producers growing fruits and vegetables in a controlled indoor environment.
“That’s not going to happen,” DiMare insists. “I don’t see that prices are going to escalate because the agreement is going to terminate.”
The termination of the TSA is set for July 14.

So pulses quickened when Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, won New York's Democratic mayoral primary","New York City mayoral dandidate Zohran Mamdani celebrates his Democratic primary victory with leaders and members of a number of city labor unions. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Maryland is traditionally a top-down state politically.
Until recently, the state’s political landscape has been dominated by senior Democrats, whose centrist, establishment politics continue to hold sway in the State House and in many local governments. Young, aspiring politicians are frequently told, implicitly if not explicitly, to wait their turn before seeking higher office. Even in a state legislature with Democratic supermajorities, progressive initiatives are often held at bay.
So the pulses of young progressives in Maryland quickened considerably last week when a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, Zohran Mamdani, emerged as the unlikely victor in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City and is now the frontrunner in the November general election. And the Democratic establishment and donor class, in the city and beyond, are assessing whether to embrace Mamdani and his movement or continue strategizing for ways to suppress it.
“It’s certainly an exciting moment because it’s a people-powered victory very clearly – an underdog story,” said Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink (D), a leading progressive voice in local and state politics. “Any time we see a number of people engaged and able to defeat big money, it’s important to take note of that.”
It’s hard to extrapolate much from a single local election – especially one in such a unique environment as The Big Apple, where Mamdani’s principal primary opponent was the uniquely flawed former governor, Andrew Cuomo. But pundits across the political spectrum are calling the primary results an earthquake – and earthquakes can have reverberations far from their fault lines.
As the 2026 election cycle heats up in Maryland, and as Democrats here and nationally continue to reel from the 2024 election and its profound implications, it’s worth examining whether Mamdani’s message and winning coalition provide some lessons that can be applied here.
A parade — of speakers — and a hint of rain at annual Hoyer bull roast, but no hints on his plans

Mamdani’s victory was partly generational and partly ideological. The state assemblyman from Queens had an expansive economic agenda that focused on affordability and the New Yorkers who are struggling to survive in a hyper-expensive city. He highlighted proposals for rent freezes, free transit, affordable child care and government-sponsored grocery stores in food deserts, among others.
Mamdani’s thoroughly modern campaign, fueled by nontraditional media outreach, produced an array of responses from Maryland political leaders on social media last week.
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), a fellow Indian-American, offered congratulations on X to Mamdani “and everyone who fought alongside him. You stood up for the underdog – and won.”
Ian Miller, a 23-year-old member of the Baltimore County Democratic Central Committee who has frequently clashed with party insiders, on Facebook called Mamdani’s victory “the Gen Z Obama moment.”
Former U.S. Rep. John Delaney (D) offered a more nuanced analysis on X, recognizing Mamdani’s appeal to “base” Democratic voters, but asking, “How do people reconcile the fact that (more centrist) Andrew Cuomo’s campaign was funded by mega donors and he won the low income neighborhoods and (more progressive) Zohran’s campaign was grass roots and he won the wealthy neighborhoods?”
Some national political analysts said they saw Mamdani’s victory as reflecting economic jitters across all classes – and the pent-up frustrations of younger Democrats who don’t see senior party leaders standing up to President Trump and other MAGA Republicans. Do some of the same conditions exist on the ground in Maryland that helped propel Mamdani to victory? Where can political parallels be drawn between New York and the Free State?
Larry Stafford, executive director of the group Progressive Maryland, said New York voters produced results that have already been evident in pockets of Maryland in recent years.
“I see this victory as part of a trend that’s emerging,” he said. “Like a lot of movements, first it goes forward, then it stumbles back, then it moves forward again.”
Generational change
There is no question that Maryland is in the midst of a generational shift politically. It began with the departures of Attorney General Joe Curran (D) and Comptroller (and former governor) William Donald Schaefer (D) following the 2006 election, and has accelerated with the retirements of multiterm U.S. Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D) and Ben Cardin (D), the deaths of record-serving House Speaker Michael Busch (D) and Senate President Mike Miller (D), the defeat of four senior members of the state Senate in 2018 Democratic primaries, and the retirements of three Democratic members of Maryland’s U.S. House delegation last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state made history in 2022 by electing its first Black governor and attorney general, its first female state comptroller and its first woman of color to serve as lieutenant governor – each considerably younger than their predecessors. Two of the state’s new members of Congress, Reps. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-3rd) and Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), are 36 and 42, respectively. Brandon Scott was the youngest mayor of Baltimore ever elected in 2020, when he was 36 years old.
With the swearing in of a new member last month, the 11-person Prince George’s County Council now has five millennials, led by full-throated progressives Ed Burroughs (D) and Krystal Oriadha (D).
Four years ago, there were none.
“I think that’s to the benefit of the county because we have a younger population,” said Councilmember Tom Dernoga (D), who is 66. “I think it’s better that we reflect the population than with older folks like me, and I’ll be retiring soon so I’ll be replaced by someone younger and we’ll be skewing even younger.”
There have been distinct progressive victories in Democratic primaries over the years in Maryland – some representing significant upsets – though they haven’t necessarily changed the overall political arc of the state.
One such political victory came in 2006, when constitutional law professor Jamie Raskin ousted veteran Montgomery County state Sen. Ida Ruben in the Democratic primary. Now a congressman, Raskin has since become an icon of the left nationally.
Another came in 2018, when former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a lifelong progressive activist and Bernie Sanders acolyte, defeated more established Democratic politicians in the primary for governor. Jealous’ victory came on the same night that a 27-year-old bartender named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked a top congressional Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley, in the New York Democratic primary – so Jealous never quite got his due, especially after losing the general election that year.
“The national landscape never took note of that victory as much,” Stafford said.
That same year, an avowed democratic socialist, Marc Elrich, was elected Montgomery County executive, narrowly defeating a self-funding multimillionaire in the process – and narrowly beating him again in a rematch four years later. Prince George’s voters recently elected a longtime political outsider, Aisha Braveboy (D), as county executive – though it remains to be seen if she will govern as far to the left as some of her allies on the county council would like her to.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) won election at the age of 44, with big ideas to alleviate childhood poverty, create an equitable economy and tackle generational challenges like climate change. But constricted by budgetary challenges, some of his own cautious impulses, and institutional roadblocks in Annapolis, the governor has found that transformational change isn’t all that easy.
Stafford predicted that Maryland progressives will take the winning formulas of certain successful candidates, along with Mamdani’s, and apply it to the upcoming election cycle – and to working with allies inside and out of government.
“It will look different than it has in the past,” he said. “The coalitions will look different.”
Mink, the Montgomery County councilmember, said she believes progressive policy progress can be achieved more easily at the local level than in the State House, because there aren’t so many powerful forces working in opposition.
“It’s much easier to secure a people-powered win at the county level,” she said.
‘Hell yes, it emboldens me’
One 2026 Democratic candidate who is already making the generational case against a long-time incumbent is Harry Jarin, the small business owner and volunteer firefighter who is challenging 86-year-old U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving Democrat in the House of Representatives. Asked in an interview last week whether Mamdani’s victory emboldens him, Jarin replied, “Hell yes, it emboldens me.”
Jarin said that even if Mamdani’s policy prescriptions didn’t appeal to every voter, “he tapped into that insecurity that a lot of younger voters feel and the feeling that establishment Democrats haven’t done anything to address it. It’s voters rejecting the status quo, just as they did in November when they elected Donald Trump. And right now, the establishment Democrats are the status quo.”
Hoyer has not yet said whether he will seek a 23rd full term next year, and several elected officials, including some with close ties to the veteran lawmaker, could jump into a race to replace him. But Jarin said he’s ready to pivot if circumstances change without having to change his strategy.
“Even if he does drop out, I expect he’ll try to shove some other establishment Democrat with no real-world experience down our throats,” Jarin said. “To me, this has never been just about age. For me this has always been about the need to reconnect the Democratic Party with the working class electorate it has lost ground with and continues to lose ground with.
“It makes no difference if my opponent is 86 or 31. My message will be the same: We need people with experience away from the political system to serve in office,” he said.
Another key race where Mamdani’s playbook could come into play is in the Democratic primary to replace Elrich as Montgomery County executive, where Councilmember Will Jawando (D), who is running with Elrich’s endorsement, is almost certain to stake out multiple positions to the left of his principal opponents – who by most standards are pretty liberal themselves.
“The path to success is through people power,” said Mink, who has also endorsed Jawando’s bid for executive. “People are very hungry for electeds whose words, whose actions, whose opinions match the urgency of what’s happening on the ground. There’s important lessons to be learned from New York.”

Freeman’s 2022 debut LP, “I Looked Out,” has had a belated surge in reputation and put him on the map. His second record, “Burnover,” could thrust him into the spotlight.

It took a little time for Greg Freeman’s debut record to really make its mark. 
The Burlington-based singer-songwriter released “I Looked Out” in July 2022 on the tiny Oregon label Bud Tapes to little fanfare and sparse reviews. About five months later, Freeman and his band took the record on tour outside of Vermont. 
By then, the album had begun to develop a following, an authentic word-of-mouth success that has gradually picked up steam, making Freeman something of a cult figure among those in the know.
“The reception was pretty slow building, I guess,” Freeman said recently, reclining on the porch of his Burlington home, one of the many faded clapboard houses that line the city’s downtown streets. 
Just a few weeks prior, the Vermont musician had returned from his first extended tour in Europe, where he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout he generated.
“People came to the Paris show,” Freeman said, nodding happily. “The England shows that we did were really great too.”  
This past fall, Freeman was signed to Canvasback, an imprint of Transgressive Records, which promptly reissued “I Looked Out” on vinyl. 
In August, the label is releasing Freeman’s second LP, “Burnover,” which is poised to be a career defining success, the kind of thing you could hear blasting in dorm rooms and dive bars alike for the rest of the year.

It’s a sprawling, dreamlike collection of elegant indie gems and hard rock epics, anchored by razor sharp guitar riffs and the distinctly airy voice that has earned Freeman comparisons to Neil Young and Jason Molina, of Songs: Ohia fame.
Freeman said he wrote a good portion of the album in a single sprint, a month long period after his first tour for “I Looked Out” that he spent hunkering down with his guitar back in Vermont.
“I just woke up in this house every day, and everyone was at work, and I played music and watched movies all day long,” Freeman said, looking across his porch. “I think once you do that for long enough, things start flowing better.”  
Shortly thereafter, a steady stream of retrospective praise for his debut and raucous live performances began to lay a long runway for the new album’s arrival.
Last spring, he and his band appeared at South by Southwest and were singled out in subsequent coverage of the Texas music festival. 
Write ups in Paste, Stereogum and Rolling Stone have since followed, with some heralding Freeman as the next MJ Lenderman — the 26-year old Asheville-based musician and current golden boy of indie rock. 
Freeman has also been getting invitations to share the stage with larger names. Prior to his jaunt in Europe, he supported Walkmen singer Hamilton Leithausser for a stretch of his solo tour, and in the Fall he’ll be opening for the iconic indie band Grandaddy for a series of shows in the Northeast. 


Freeman grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, playing guitar in his room while nursing an obsession with traditional blues greats like Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson from an early age. 
The White Stripes, with their Son House covers and blues-inflected garage jams, served as a gateway drug from the early masters to the classic rock and contemporary indie records that Freeman began to favor more throughout high school and college. “That was the first, like, contemporary band that I was super into,” he said.
Before attending the University of Vermont, he took a gap year and played alone at open mics across the country, often sleeping in his car as he hopped from town to town. 
When Freeman finally arrived in Burlington in 2017, he was bowled over by the vitality of the local music scene. “I came here and everyone was in bands, and there was so much music everywhere,” Freeman said. “That was really a first for me.” 
Freeman joined the fray, playing basement shows before moving up to venues like Radio Bean and Artsriot, where he mostly performed as a solo artist backed by many of the musicians that remain in his band today.
In the years since, Freeman has stayed around the Queen City, becoming a mainstay in the city’s burgeoning indie scene alongside friends and contemporaries like the band Robber Robber and singer-songwriter Lily Seabird, who played with Freeman’s band for several years. 
With its tight-knit social scene and sprawling bucolic surroundings, Burlington is, for Freeman, a city of contradictions that has given him much of his material. Scraps of overheard dialogue make it into his work, as do shades of the more complicated social dynamics that come with living in such a small city.
“There’s kind of like a suffocating social environment here sometimes,” he said, grinning. “But then there’s also, you know, so much green, beautiful space.” 
The odd contrast is something Freeman said he tried to evoke in Burnover. For all its catchy hooks and colorful guitars, the record is a study in the peculiar feeling of loneliness that you get from never quite being alone. 
“My thoughts die out slowly on the blood swept plains / where I see you every night,” Freeman sings on “Curtain,” one of the singles from the record.
Rejecting the term “concept album,” Freeman said that “Burnover” was more intentionally cohesive than his last, with sonic motifs and language that recur throughout.
“I want you to be able to visualize a certain place when you listen to the whole thing,” he said. 
The place isn’t Vermont or New England exactly, he said, but something similar, something green, gothic, weird.
“I’m always kind of trying to write about the places where I live — the spaces around me and the people around me,” he said.
Accordingly, whatever comes after “Burnover” could represent a change of pace for the Vermont musician. 
Before he accompanied Leithauser on tour, he headed to New Mexico, where he spent almost a month alone in the desert, writing the bulk of what will be his third album. 
“It was pretty out there,” Freeman said. 
He returned home with a batch of new songs, but his sojourn out west hasn’t made him want to leave. For now, he said, he would be in Burlington for the foreseeable future.
“It’s weird, though, how much has happened in this neighborhood,” he said as he peered down the road. “I’ve lived on all these streets.”

Thirty years after wolves were brought back from near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, the state of Idaho is back in the wolf-killing business.
Based on direction from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60% over six years.
According to the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028, the state’s goal is to reduce the wolf population down from the estimated average of 1,270 wolves to a new average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves.
Based on the population dynamics in Idaho’s wolf population, the state estimates humans would need to kill about 37% of Idaho’s estimated wolf population each year for six years to reach the goal of an average population of 500 wolves
While nearly everyone in the wolf debate says it’s extremely difficult to get an accurate count of the animals within the state’s borders, some wolf advocates don’t agree with Idaho officials on how many wolves are actually in the state due to the research methods used until recently.
And some worry that if the state doesn’t have an accurate wolf population count, it doesn’t know how many wolves should be killed under the management plan.
 Current wolf hunting, trapping policies a grim reminder of eradication campaign from the past, early wolf member of wolf management team says

Idaho legislators are driving the policy by responding to concerns from farmers and ranchers who have had animals like sheep and cattle killed by wolves.
Between 2014 and 2023, wolves in Idaho killed a minimum of 1,291 domestic livestock animals, according to state records. The losses affected 299 different ranchers and farmers.
But for Marcie Carter, one of the early members of the Nez Perce Tribe’s program that managed wolves in Idaho, the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping and the government-sponsored killing of wolves in Idaho is a grim reminder of the eradication campaign that nearly killed off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1940s.
Wolves are a native species in Idaho and all across the U.S. But as setters moved West, the U.S. government passed wolf-killing bounties meant to encourage westward expansion. By 1926, rangers had killed the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The last wolf in Idaho was killed in the 1930s, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
In one of the most successful and controversial wildlife comeback stories in American history, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and Idaho in 1995.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” said Carter, who now works as the watershed coordinator for the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries Resource Management.
 The impact of wolves on livestock in Idaho

Having livestock killed is a big deal to the rancher who owns that animal.
But some wolf advocates say that, big picture, the number of livestock killed by wolves is pretty low every year.
From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 259 livestock deaths each year in Idaho that were deemed “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. (Depredation is the term officials use when a predator like a wolf kills or maims livestock like cattle. Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said “confirmed” or “probable” determinations are dependent on sufficient evidence remaining, which is dependent on very rapid detection and investigation of the carcass and minimal disturbance by scavengers. Those criteria often aren’t met in remote environments, therefore the documented “confirmed” and “probable” depredations should be considered a minimum number, Fish and Game officials said.)
That’s in a state with about 2.5 million head of cattle and 235,000 sheep – including on feedlots and dairies where wolves and other predators are not present. 
That means wolves kill an average of about 0.01% of Idaho’s combined cattle and sheep population each year.
 How does Idaho estimate its wolf population?

All sides in the wolf debate agree it is extremely difficult to produce an exact population count of wolves in Idaho.
The state is too big, the terrain is too rugged and wolves are too elusive for that to happen.
Instead, officials use multiple different techniques to estimate that wolf population.
Until recently, Idaho Fish and Game officials used wildlife trail cameras and a statistical model to estimate the state’s wolf population.
Some outside researchers expressed concern with the accuracy of using wildlife cameras to estimate wolf populations.
Scott Creel, an ecologist and conservation biologist who works for Montana State University, has studied carnivores since 1987 and studied wolf-elk interactions since the 1990s.
Creel has been critical of wolf population methods used in Montana and Idaho.
“I was frustrated with seeing methods being used to estimate wolf numbers that were very indirect and, in my opinion, were unlikely to produce accurate estimates,” Creel said. “I was particularly worried that the methods I was seeing used would produce estimates that wouldn’t change, even if the wolf numbers were really changing. So the wolf population would appear to be constant, even though the policy changed just because of the way we were counting them, which is extremely oblique in both of the two methods that I was reviewing.”

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks declined an interview request for this story.
Creel stressed that accurately estimating wolf populations is extremely difficult.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials disagree with Creel’s criticism, but acknowledged trail cam population estimation methods become less reliable when the number of images of wolves from the trail cameras declines.
In July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game announced a new wolf population estimation procedure.
Instead of using trail cams, officials are using new methods involving combination of genetic and information taken from a tooth of every wolf mortality documented by the state, information on the biological range of wolf population dynamics, a statistical model, and actual wolf hunting and mortality data.
It’s called the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation, which Idaho Fish and Game officials said has been used widely in other scientific fields like epidemiology and population genetics. Biometricians use that method to estimate the total number of new litters of wolf pups each year and the average estimated wolf population.
When he introduced the new wolf population estimate in July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts said the new population estimation method independently produced similar population estimates to the trail cam method’s population estimates from 2019 to 2022 using different data.
Roberts said that gives him confidence the new method produces consistent and reasonable population estimates. He also said it backs up the old trail cam method that outside researchers have publicly criticized.
“Although no population estimation technique is perfect, we now have an independent source of information that validates the camera-based estimates that we’ve been using to guide wolf management since 2019 and refutes the idea that those estimates are wildly erroneous, as some have claimed,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
But for 2023, the trail cam method and the new method produced different population estimates.
The new method estimated 1,150 wolves, while the trail cam method estimated 840 wolves, Roberts said.
Even though it has been a year since Idaho Fish and Game officials announced their new estimation methods, the methods do not appear on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s website for public review.
Howl reporters Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin asked Idaho Fish and Game officials for a copy of the state’s new methods for estimating the wolf population.
In March, Fish and Game officials said the only available information is a YouTube video of officials announcing their wolf population presentation. The relevant discussion takes place more than four hours into a six-hour Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting on July 24, 2024.
Officials said they are working to publish their methods.
“We are in the process of preparing a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication on the method, which we hope to have submitted for publication later this spring or early summer,” Roberts said in March.
As of June 24, the department had not yet published its new wolf population estimation methods in a peer-reviewed publication. Roberts said June 24 that officials are close to submitting it and hope to have it submitted for peer-reviewed publication before the upcoming July 17 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
Despite questions and criticisms of past methods, Roberts said he is confident in using the new population estimation to drive wolf management decisions in Idaho.
“Because we were able to produce five years of virtually identical estimates between (the new methods) and the camera-based methods we’ve used before, we are confident this transition will result in consistent information to inform wolf management in the state,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
 Why Idaho’s wolf population estimate is important

Bob Crabtree, who founded the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center, said accuracy in wolf population estimates is extremely important.
“It’s like asking a business owner to try to make a profit or try to avoid losing money by not knowing what items they have on the shelves that they stock in their store,” Crabtree said. “Population size, or abundance, is the No. 1 criteria used to successfully manage and conserve and restore wolves. And without it, you just can’t.”
Many wolf laws and policies rely on wolf population estimates.
State Sen. Van Burtenshaw, a Republican rancher from the town of Terreton, Idaho, sponsored Senate Bill 1211, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law in 2021.
The law removed the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters could buy each year, legalized wolf trapping year round on private property and allowed the state of Idaho to contract with federal agencies and other third parties to kill wolves.
Burtenshaw said he pushed for the law because his constituents told him there are too many wolves eating too much livestock.
“The big thing was the amount of farmers and ranchers that were dealing with significant losses because of the wolf population,” Burtenshaw said. “Originally when the wolf was reintroduced, they were talking about 150 or something in the Idaho region. And we had well over 1,500, almost 1,600, for a long time. So the depredation cost was huge to those that had livestock and other animals as well.”
“That population has kind of got out of balance, and that’s what we’re trying to figure out is where that balance is,” Burtenshaw said.
 The impact of wolf hunting in Idaho

Idaho sold more than 53,000 wolf tags to hunters in 2023 even though there are only an estimated 1,150 wolves in the state, according to documents provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
More than half of those wolf tags were sold in the popular “sportsman’s package,” which includes a hunting/fishing combo license and tags for deer, elk, bear, wolf, mountain lion, turkey, salmon and steelhead. (State officials said they do not know the percentage of hunters who bought a wolf tag because wolves are the primary animal they are hunting vs. the percentage of hunters who primarily hunted other animal species but still bought a wolf tag.)
From the 2019-20 wolf hunting season through the 2023-24 hunting season, hunters and trappers killed an average of more than 400 wolves a year in Idaho, according to Idaho Fish and Game.
In addition to expanding wolf hunting and trapping, Idaho also financially reimburses expenses for hunters who successfully kill a wolf.
Since 2019, the state of Idaho has paid out $849,750 in reimbursements to successful wolf hunters, according to data provided by the Idaho Fish and Game.
The money is Idaho Fish and Game funding that is transferred to the Wolf Depredation Control Board for the Foundation for Wildlife Management’s reimbursement program, Fish and Game officials said. Separately, the foundation has applied for and received Idaho Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants.
“Our end (goal) in this originally was focused on trying to direct the harvest where we were seeing the greatest impacts – chronic livestock depredation, elk populations below objective, where predation was a factor – to try to focus that effort where harvest at that time was not sufficient to stabilize the wolf numbers,” said Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director of Operations Jon Rachael, who was an original member of the wolf recovery team.
In the context of hunting, the word harvest means successfully killing a game animal such as a wolf.
The reimbursement money can be used for firearms, ammo, traps, trail cameras, gear, license fees, fuel and even ATV vehicles used to scout or hunt wolves, according to the foundation.
Rusty Kramer, the president of the Idaho Trappers Association, said he has used state reimbursement money to make payments on his truck, which he uses when he is tracking and trapping wolves.
The standard reimbursement in Idaho is capped at $750 per wolf.
But in areas where elk populations are below their objective, or livestock have been repeatedly killed by wolves, the reimbursement limit increases to $2,000 per wolf.
Some wolf supporters call the program a bounty system and scoff at the idea of the state sending checks to people who shot wolves to help pay off their trucks and ATVs.
But Idaho Fish and Game officials insist it is only a reimbursement program – not a bounty.
“Any of the funds that come from the state of Idaho, from the Wolf Depredation Control Board, or, in the past, from the Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants did require that this money was not just a straight payment of a certain amount, but rather the individual claiming compensation present evidence of their expenses,” Rachael said. “And so in that regard, it was compensation for their investment of buying traps or fuel to run a trap line.”
 U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed it killed juvenile wolves in Idaho

When the state kills wolves, it doesn’t just kill adult wolves that are confirmed to have attacked livestock.
The state, other government agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and third party contractors can kill wolf pups in their dens and their nursing mother – even if those specific wolves never attacked a cow or sheep.
“You can kill wolf puppies,” said Carter Niemeyer, a former government trapper who helped bring wolves back to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park 30 years ago and opposes killing wolf pups and many of Idaho’s wolf policies. “They’re plum legal if you kill them at a day old. Stomp their head in with your boot if you want to.”

Students at Timberline High School in Boise spoke out a few years ago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services killed wolf pups from a pack that the school symbolically adopted, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In an October 2021 letter to Suzanne Asha Stone, a prominent Idaho wolf expert and a member of the wolf reintroduction team, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Lester Moffitt, confirmed the government killed eight juvenile wolves in Idaho in an attempt to relocate the larger pack and reduce the number of livestock killed.
Carter, who was on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf reintroduction team in the 1990s, is sickened that the state would authorize the killing of wolf pups that never disturbed livestock.
“I mean, it’s one thing to shoot an adult,” Carter said. “But to trap puppies in the den hole? It’s just so awful. And I don’t understand how people can be that hateful to one species of animal that has a right to be here. But for sure, the state has not done their due diligence.”
“I‘ll just stop there,” Carter added. “The state of Idaho is not taking care of this species.”
Since wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011, the USDA Wildlife Services and other agencies have killed 961 wolves in Idaho, according to Idaho Department of Fish and Game documents.

Since 2018, Idaho Fish and Game has spent $817,668 on lethal control actions to kill wolves in Idaho, according to documents the department provided. That total specifically refers to Idaho Fish and Game funding through the Wolf Depredation Control Board that was not spent on reimbursements made by the Foundation for Wildlife Management.
One of Idaho’s policies is that even when nonlethal tools are available to reduce conflicts between livestock and wolves, the state can kill wolves without first trying the nonlethal tools.
“Livestock producers may use deterrents to aid in protecting their property; however, they are not a prerequisite for lethal removal,” the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028 states. “Regardless of use or success of nonlethal methods, landowners may request a special kill permit from IDFG for use on lawfully permitted public and private lands. IDFG will continue to employ lethal removal as needed to address both individual depredations and overall population goals”
 30 years after wolf reintroduction, some of the people who brought wolves back worry about their future

Longtime wolf advocates say the government-sponsored killing of wolves and expansions in hunting and trapping is reducing the number of wolves.
Now, 30 years after the first wolves were returned to Idaho and 14 years after they came off the Endangered Species List, several prominent members of the team that brought wolves back worry about the threats wolves face today.
Niemeyer is a longtime government trapper who has tracked wolves across Idaho and Montana since before reintroduction in 1995. Intimately familiar with wolves, he was a member of the team that traveled to Canada 30 years ago to capture wolves to reintroduce them to Idaho and Montana.
For years after reintroduction, Carter studied the packs and knew the location of many dens in central Idaho.
Niemeyer was so confident in his ability to find wolves that he regularly guided donors who supported conservation organizations into the wild to see wolves.  He knew the landscape well enough he could set up camp just close enough for the donors to see and howl for wolves as Niemeyer cooked cowboy-style dinners for the group.
But those days are over.
Over the last few years, Niemeyer said he and his longtime contacts are no longer seeing wolves in the wild the same places they always used to.
“When they’re in there, they see virtually little or no sign of any wolf existence in the Frank,” Niemeyer said, referring to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. “If you put together what I’m seeing, or better yet, what I’m not seeing…. Nobody’s finding any wolf evidence. So where are these 1,300 or 1,500 wolves?”
Niemeyer’s luck isn’t any better than his friends.
During a Howl reporting trip in July 2024, Niemeyer found wolf scat and wolf tracks, but no wolves. And during another, separate expedition in 2024, he said he struck out entirely – he didn’t even see a wolf track.
“The Big Buck Pack, Steel Mountain Pack, Jackson Pack, Archie Pack, I can name all these packs up there, Thorn Creek – there’s no packs in those places anymore, mostly because of domestic sheep that came in there and Wildlife Services just went to hammering wolves,” Niemeyer said. “And then you’ve got the recreational hunting and trapping that started when (wolves) were delisted.”
“You’ll still find a wolf track up in that country,” Niemeyer said. “But to say there’s anything like the numbers there were, I don’t believe it. You wouldn’t convince me.”
Carter worries about new expanded wolf hunting, trapping and lethal control policies in the state of Idaho.
“The state of Idaho is going to – if they haven’t already – plunge wolves back towards extinction, at least in Idaho,” Carter said.
“How do you manage if you don’t know how many you have?” Carter added.
She isn’t alone in worrying about the state management of wolves and the removal of limits on hunting and trapping.
“Is it a violation of our treaty?” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler said. “Is it a violation of something that we were meant to protect? Of course it is. Of course it’s a violation of what was here in 1855 and before then. And that’s a part of tamáalwit, or the unwritten law, which we know that Article Three and the Treaty of 1855 with the Nez Perce represents.”
Some members of the wolf reintroduction teams say attitudes are even worse today than they were 30 years ago.
“Our country’s worse now than it was in terms of polarization, so those extreme divisions have only widened and become more cemented,” said Stone, executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project. “ Back then, if I had told anyone from the opposition that didn’t want to have wolves back that they would be trapping and killing wolves 365 days of the year, using bounties to kill even pups in the den, they would have told me I was crazy and that would never happen – never happen. And we’re living it today. That is the reality on the ground today.”

Stone isn’t alone.
“Oh, I’m pretty worried,” said Doug Smith, who headed up the wolf program at Yellowstone National Park for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Attitudes haven’t changed,” Smith said. “The fact is, they’re worse now. I’ve been studying wolves for over 40 years, and wolves have always been controversial. There’s always been people who like wolves and people who hate wolves. Now it’s like people are willing to do anything to get rid of wolves or anything to protect wolves, and they don’t want to talk to each other. I don’t think that’s progress, and right now the anti-wolf forces are winning in Idaho and Montana especially.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.

As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.

The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

The colors around the thermal features are locations of different thermophile communities. These thermophiles fix carbon, both from the atmosphere and from the hot water. (Jim Peaco/National Park Service)On the morning of June 21, visitors at Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park observed a bison slip into a shallow part of the hot spring. Clearly alarmed by the hot water — up to about 192 degrees Fahrenheit, which is just below boiling temperature at that elevation — the animal stumbled as it tried to get out and ended up stepping into an area of deeper water and quickly perished.
Yellowstone National Park officials decided not to remove the carcass. Such work would be dangerous and could cause extensive damage to the colorful bacterial mats that give Grand Prismatic Spring its name — that sort of damage can take more than a year to naturally repair itself. The bison’s body will break down quickly in the near-boiling water, and soon only the bones will be left.
Although rarely witnessed, it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. For example, an elk calf died while struggling to extract itself from mud pots in West Thumb Geyser Basin several years ago.
There are also animal skeletons visible in many hot springs, like Gentian Pool, Ojo Caliente, and the aptly named Skeleton Pool. Unexpectedly in 2022, University of California at Berkeley researchers found an elk skeleton in Doublet Pool, located on Geyser Hill near Old Faithful, when they put a camera into the spring as part of a study of hydrothermal activity. Similar incidents may have gone unwitnessed in the backcountry, or in winter or at night.
Animals can obviously feel the heat of thermal areas through their feet or hooves, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they never make mistakes near hydrothermal features. Most of these wildlife fatalities probably take place when animals break through thin crusts on the edges of springs.
The unfortunate incident of the bison at Grand Prismatic Spring provides an opportunity to revisit a common misconception about hot springs in Yellowstone, and also emphasize how to safely enjoy viewing the thermal features in the park.
Many visitors to Yellowstone believe that all of the hot springs in the park are acidic (pH lower than 5), and that the water will cause an acid burn on contact and dissolve any animals or people that fall into the springs. But nearly all major hot springs and geysers in Yellowstone are actually neutral (pH of around 7) or alkaline (pH greater than 7), including almost all of the geysers and hot springs in the famous thermal basins along the Firehole River.
Acidic features tend to be the fumaroles (gas vents), mud pots, and frying pans, which are all dominated by the release of acidic gases. One of the most acidic front-country features in the park is Sulphur Cauldron, in the Mud Volcano area. Fluids there have a pH less than 2, which is an acidity between that of stomach acid and lemon juice. Fortunately, acid concentrations are low, so mud and water from these features will not burn on contact, although it can cause skin irritation.
What kills most animals and occasionally people who fall into hot springs is not acidity, but temperature. Many hot springs are at or near boiling temperatures, and animal life will not survive for long when exposed, even if only briefly, to water that hot.
This is why staying on boardwalks in thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is a requirement and is so important for visitor safety. Many thermal areas have thin crusts at the surface that overlie boiling waters or even hotter steam. Many injuries and fatalities to people have happened off boardwalk, when people have broken through these crusts, stepped on an unsupported sinter ledge, or stumbled into springs that were obscured or not obvious.
Yellowstone is a wild and dynamic place and can be hazardous. Fortunately, humans (and most animals) can recognize and avoid those hazards. So be sure to enjoy Yellowstone’s magnificent thermal areas from the safety of trails and boardwalks, and don’t forget to stay a safe distance from wildlife wherever you may encounter the park’s charismatic megafauna.

(Courtesy of Sgt. Christopher Richardson)LINCOLN — A new state law that took effect this week authorizes emergency medical services crews to provide care or transportation to Nebraska K-9s if one is ever injured in the line of duty.
Lawmakers, by a 47-0 vote in April 2024, approved a measure from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston allowing emergency medical services for K-9s after July 1, 2025. It covers law enforcement canines owned or employed by state or local law enforcement, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, local fire departments or the State Fire Marshal’s Office.
K-9s aiding in the detection of criminal activity, flammable materials or missing persons; enforcement of laws; investigation of fires or apprehending criminal offenders would be covered.
Riepe said K-9s have proven beneficial and he hopes the law works out well.
“I think most people have a real kind spot in their heart for both dogs, cats, and probably some other animals that I’m not even aware of,” Riepe said this week.

Cody Thomas, a spokesperson for the Nebraska State Patrol, which employs and trains police service dogs, said the canines are “an extension of the officers they work with every day.” Such work can be dangerous for K-9s, with at least 10 killed in the line of duty nationwide already in 2025, he said.
“In the event one of our K-9 partners is injured in the line of duty, we would be grateful for any assistance provided by EMS teams, including transportation to an emergency veterinary hospital,” Thomas said in an email to the Nebraska Examiner.
At least two Nebraska K-9s have been killed in the past decade: K-9 Kobus for the Omaha Police Department in 2016 and K-9 Nitro II for the York County Sheriff’s Department in 2022.
More than a dozen states have similar laws.
Riepe’s legislation began at the initiative of Nebraska City Police Department Sgt. Christopher Richardson. Richardson sought to get around a state law forbidding any emergency care for an animal, including the bandaging of a minor cut.
“These dogs are alone and untreated, wasting valuable time and preventing lifesaving measures from being performed,” Richardson testified at a February 2024 hearing.
Richardson, who has taken multiple K-9s under his wing, told the Examiner in 2024 that in the case of Nebraska City, it can be a 45-minute delay to the nearest applicable care facility should his K-9 be harmed. He had said K-9 handlers spend more one-on-one time with their dogs, who he said can save an officer’s life without hesitation, than with their families.
“They’re not just another tool that’s on our duty belt,” Richardson previously told the Examiner.

The new law still gives humans priority in the need of medical care or transport. EMS teams, including volunteer departments, would not be required to implement the new law. Any EMS workers operating in “good faith” to care for the dogs would be given civil and criminal immunity.
“We just want to make sure we don’t leave a dog that was injured in duty behind, which seems like a very common-sense thing,” Riepe told the Examiner in 2024.
The law authorized the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to implement additional regulations. Instead, DHHS and the state’s Board of Emergency Medical Services and Board of Veterinary Medicine adopted multiple recommendations.
Among the recommendations for EMS teams that take on the new law:

Have a backup ambulance or plan to respond to emergency calls while caring for or transporting a K-9.
Certification in basic life support through the RECOVER initiative.
Specific training in K-9 care.
Close alignment with a local veterinary or pet care facility that would continue K-9 care after transport..
Medical equipment suitable for animal use, including oxygen masks and/or respiratory barrier masks for “mouth to snout” use.”

“We don’t want to have to transport our dogs in an ambulance,” Richardson said last year. “But if it comes to that, having that ability is huge.”

(contributed)Small communities in North Dakota can soon apply for grant money to support their grocery stores.
Lawmakers set aside $1 million for the grant during the 2025 legislative session out of concern for rural North Dakota towns that struggle to attract or sustain businesses that sell high-quality food. 
Successful applicants can receive up to $150,000.
The program is open to local governments — including tribal governments — with populations of 4,500 people or fewer.
Applicants must be able to match the grant money by 20%. Projects have to be completed within a year-and-a-half.
The Department of Commerce says it’s looking for proposals that show cooperation between “food providers, schools, restaurants and other local entities” to improve food access and support economic development in rural communities.
In testimony submitted in support of the grant earlier this year, North Dakota Grocers Association President John Dyste said food deserts are growing across the state.
“What rural grocers need is access to funding that will allow them to upgrade their facilities and equipment,” Dyste said. “They also need reliable, affordable access to groceries and perishable products.”
He added that people looking to buy independent rural grocery stores often have trouble securing financing.
The program follows a pilot rural food sustainability grant established during the 2023 legislative session.
The application window for the rural grocery store grant opens at 3 p.m. Wednesday and closes Sept. 3 at 5 p.m. For more information, visit the link program’s webpage.
A separate Department of Commerce grant puts a total $15 million up for grabs to support North Dakota tourism. 
The idea is to support projects that will draw out-of-state visitors to North Dakota recreational locations that reflect the state’s “culture, identity or landscape.”
Individual awards can range from $25,000 to $5 million. The grant is for projects that are shovel-ready, according to the Department of Commerce. Matching funds are also required.
Previous recipients of Department of Commerce tourism grants include: 

Shores Event Center in Devils Lake
Thrill Hills, a ski hill in Fort Ransom
Indian Hills Resort, a hunting and fishing resort in Garrison

The Legislature approved the grant during the 2025 legislative session to support the state’s tourism industry.
Applications opened earlier this week and will close July 31 at 5 p.m. 
Visit the grant’s webpage for more information.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With burgers sizzling and classic rock thumping, many Americans revel in summer cookouts — at least until that wayward cousin asks for a “pop” in soda country, or even worse, a “coke” when they actually want a Sprite.
Few American linguistic debates have bubbled quite as long and effervescently as the one over whether a generic soft drink should be called a soda, pop or coke.
The word you use generally boils down to where you’re from: Midwesterners enjoy a good pop, while soda is tops in the North and far West. Southerners, long the cultural mavericks, don’t bat an eyelash asking for coke — lowercase — before homing in on exactly the type they want: Perhaps a root beer or a Coke, uppercase.
As a linguist who studies American dialects, I’m less interested in this regional divide and far more fascinated by the unexpected history behind how a fizzy “health” drink from the early 1800s spawned the modern soft drink’s many names and iterations.
 
Bubbles, anyone?
Foods and drinks with wellness benefits might seem like a modern phenomenon, but the urge to create drinks with medicinal properties inspired what might be called a soda revolution in the 1800s.
The process of carbonating water was first discovered in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, this carbonated water had become popular as a health drink and was often referred to as “soda water.” The word “soda” likely came from “sodium,” since these drinks often contained salts, which were then believed to have healing properties.
Given its alleged curative effects for health issues such as indigestion, pharmacists sold soda water at soda fountains, innovative devices that created carbonated water to be sold by the glass. A chemistry professor, Benjamin Stillman, set up the first such device in a drugstore in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1806. Its eventual success inspired a boom of soda fountains in drugstores and health spas.
By the mid-1800s, pharmacists were creating unique root-, fruit- and herb-infused concoctions, such as sassafras-based root beer, at their soda fountains, often marketing them as cures for everything from fatigue to foul moods.
These flavored, sweetened versions gave rise to the linking of the word “soda” with a sweetened carbonated beverage, as opposed to simple, carbonated water.
Seltzer — today’s popular term for such sparkling water — was around, too. But it was used only for the naturally carbonated mineral water from the German town Nieder-Selters. Unlike Perrier, sourced similarly from a specific spring in France, seltzer made the leap to becoming a generic term for fizzy water.
 
Regional naming patterns
So how did “soda” come to be called so many different things in different places?
It all stems from a mix of economic enterprise and linguistic ingenuity.
The popularity of “soda” in the Northeast likely reflects the soda fountain’s longer history in the region. Since a lot of Americans living in the Northeast migrated to California in the mid-to-late 1800s, the name likely traveled west with them.
As for the Midwestern preference for “pop” — well, the earliest American use of the term to refer to a sparkling beverage appeared in the 1840s in the name of a flavored version called “ginger pop.” Such ginger-flavored pop, though, was around in Britain by 1816, since a Newcastle songbook is where you can first see it used in text. The “pop” seems to be onomatopoeic for the noise made when the cork was released from the bottle before drinking.
Linguists don’t fully know why “pop” became so popular in the Midwest. But one theory links it to a Michigan bottling company, Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works — today known as Faygo Beverages — that used “pop” in the name of the sodas they marketed and sold. Another theory suggests that because bottles were more common in the region, soda drinkers were more likely to hear the “pop” sound than in the Northeast, where soda fountains reigned.
As for using coke generically, the first Coca-Cola was served in 1886 by Dr. John Pemberton, a pharmacist at Jacobs’ Pharmacy in Atlanta and the founder of the company. In the 1900s, the Coca-Cola company tried to stamp out the use of “Coke” for “Coca-Cola.” But that ship had already sailed. Since Coca-Cola originated and was overwhelmingly popular in the South, its generic use grew out of the fact that people almost always asked for “Coke.”

As with Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aids and seltzer, it became a generic term.
 
What’s soft about it?
Speaking of soft drinks, what’s up with that term?
It was originally used to distinguish all nonalcoholic drinks from “hard drinks,” or beverages containing spirits.
Interestingly, the original Coca-Cola formula included wine — resembling a type of alcoholic “health” drink popular overseas, Vin Mariani. But Pemberton went on to develop a “soft” version a few years later to be sold as a medicinal drink.
Due to the growing popularity of soda water concoctions, eventually “soft drink” came to mean only such sweetened carbonated beverages, a linguistic testament to America’s enduring love affair with sugar and bubbles.
With the average American guzzling almost 40 gallons per year, you can call it whatever you what. Just don’t call it healthy.

(Washington State Parks)Though Washington State Parks, like other parts of state government, did not make it through this year’s legislative session with its budget unscathed, park visitors shouldn’t notice any staffing or service changes this summer, according to the agency.
“We were fairly fortunate in that we were able to make mostly non-staffing cuts to be able to stay within budget,” said Sarah Fronk, a State Parks spokesperson.
New budget, some new state laws take effect today in Idaho

The agency’s operating budget for the 2025-27 biennium is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for the 2023-25 biennium.
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget.
“It’s really being extremely mindful of where we’re spending and what our priorities are,” Fronk said of managing the cuts, adding that maintaining safe and clean parks is the agency’s primary focus.
In addition to a smaller budget, State Parks is now expected to fund 71% of its costs with revenue from Discover Passes and other fees, up from 65% in the last budget cycle.
Discover Pass prices will rise from $30 to $45 on Oct. 1. Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites.
The Legislature approved the Discover Pass price increase during last year’s session. It’s the first price increase since the passes were introduced about 14 years ago.
“We’re really grateful to the Legislature for having our backs and kicking a little more revenue support our way,” Fronk said. “With the Discover Pass, I really can’t reiterate enough that it really does go to support your state parks and the stewardship and recreation work that we’re doing, because so much of our agency’s revenue is dependent on those sales.”
Washington State Parks manages about 123 developed parks, 6,000 campsites, 800 historic buildings and 1,300 miles of trails across 12,000 acres of land.
State Parks’ busy summer season runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in September.
“We’re anticipating that there’ll be a lot of visitors to state parks this year, and so we’re definitely gearing up for that,” Fronk said.
In an effort to support staff with a smaller budget, State Parks is bolstering its education programs “so that people coming into the park don’t need quite as much help, and we can stay focused on cleaning and doing interpretive work,” Fronk said.
New this summer, State Parks has partnered with the Washington State Parks Foundation and the online education platform Fridie Outdoors to create an educational video series for park visitors.
State Parks also has a variety of outdoor guides and other resources available on its website to help visitors build outdoor literacy.
“I really believe that, once people get those experiences outdoors and understand more what they’re seeing around them, they’re going to be more excited and interested in helping protect that, as well,” Fronk said.

Free.,"On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his 'big, beautiful bill' into law","Ariana Figueroa, Jane Norman",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fourth-july-trump-signs-his-big-beautiful-bill-law,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed into law Friday evening his massive spending cut and tax break package to fulfill his domestic policy agenda on immigration and defense and overhaul American energy production.The “big, beautiful bill,” which Trump signed on Republicans' self-imposed Fourth of July deadline, will make permanent the 2017 tax cuts from his first term and provide billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years, according to its most recent analysis.“America is winning, winning, winning like never before,” said Trump, speaking to military families at a Fourth of July picnic on the White House lawn prior to the bill signing. Military aircraft including a B-2 bomber flew over the White House as the national anthem was sung.Trump saluted 150 airmen and their families at the event from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where the B-2s that bombed Iran in June originated their flights.But he also attacked Democrats who opposed his legislation, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who gave a speech on the floor in opposition on Wednesday that broke a House record for its length.Members of the Cabinet were present for the bill-signing as well as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Crapo of Idaho and other top GOP members of Congress.The president signed the bill seated at a desk in front of the picnic-goers, with lawmakers and Cabinet members surrounding him. Johnson presented Trump with the gavel that Johnson said he used when the vote closed to pass the “big, beautiful bill.” Trump pounded on the desk with the gavel and handed out pens to those gathered around him.Medicaid slashedIn order to fulfill priorities in the tax and spending cut bill, congressional Republicans scaled back spending on Medicaid, food assistance for low-income people and clean energy programs.Democrats objected to the cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and other provisions. But because Republicans have unified control of Congress, the GOP was able to pass the bill through a complex process known as reconciliation, skirting the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.The Senate passed its version of the bill after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking 51-50 vote Tuesday. The House managed Thursday to pass the new version of the bill after two chaotic days negotiating with far-right members who initially objected to the bill and later acquiesced, with a vote of 218-214.The only Republicans to object in the Senate were Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis. The House GOP members who voted with Democrats were Kentucky’s Thomas Massie and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick.Also tucked into the bill is a provision that raises the country’s debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which has brought objections from Republican fiscal hawks like Paul.",,,,2025-07-04 19:03:46.736062

(Courtesy of Ned Pillersdorf)Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf is hoping to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers next year. 
Pillersdorf was scheduled to formally announce his candidacy at the Rosenberg Square in the Floyd County seat Friday afternoon, but he spoke with the Kentucky Lantern earlier this week about his plans. Pillersdorf, a Democrat, said his decision to run stems mostly from Rogers’ support for the sweeping GOP megabill that includes cuts to social safety net programs on which many people in the district depend.
Rogers, of Somerset, has represented Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District for nearly 45 years. The region includes much of Appalachian Kentucky. 
The congressional district is also one of the nation’s poorest and one of the most dependent on Medicaid. Almost half of the constituents in the district — 44% — rely on the state-federal program to pay for their health care and it has been critical to sustaining hospital services in Eastern Kentucky.
Pillersdorf — whose law office proclaims, “We represent underdogs” — is known as the attorney who stepped up to represent thousands of Eastern Kentuckians who lost disability benefits after being represented by disgraced attorney Eric Conn.
Conn was convicted of defrauding the Social Security Administration and sentenced to prison. Pillersdorf is featured prominently in the 2022 Apple TV+ documentary series, “The Big Conn,” which recaps the case and Conn’s capture after he fled to Honduras. 
Pillersdorf also is no stranger to politics, as he helped run nonpartisan campaigns for his wife, former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Janet Stumbo. She became the first woman elected to the state’s high court in 1993. 
  U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers
However, Pillersdorf says this campaign is “not so much about me” but “what’s on the horizon” for people who will lose safety net resources under the GOP bill. 
Pillersdorf said Rogers’ backing of the legislation is “a betrayal of the needs of our citizens,” as the legislation “will cause incalculable damage to this region.” As the legislation moved through Congress, Pillersdorf said he decided to combine his campaign announcement with a protest against the safety net cuts. 
“I just think that that bill will have tremendous impacts across the board, and Hal Rogers truly betrayed the needs to protect the safety net,” Pillersdorf said. 
The Democratic candidate also has concerns about other clawbacks of federal funding for local programs under the Trump administration, such as a shutdown of Job Corps programs and education funding that is now up in the air. Within the congressional district, Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining $3 million in pandemic relief funding to replace 25 school buses lost during 2022 floods, but Trump’s U.S. Department of Education nixed the reimbursement. The Trump administration also canceled a grant to the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County that was to support reading and math intervention programs.
“There is just a systemwide attack on the safety net on multiple fronts, and my criticism of the Democratic Party is we don’t pay attention to rural voters, and we are a rural district, and we are under attack,” Pillersdorf said. “And I intended to be an independent Democratic voice for our rural community to fight back about what’s going on on multiple fronts.” 
Pillersdorf acknowledged that the Democratic Party’s reputation in rural America right now is “problematic.” Kentucky Democrats have faced a recent setback in Eastern Kentucky after longtime state Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, joined the Republican Party. However, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told Kentucky Democrats during a June dinner that he is focused on getting “the DNC out of D.C.” in hopes of bringing rural voters back into the fold. 
The political landscape “is radically changing” as voters hear more about the GOP megabill, Pillersdorf said. He added that he believes the legislation “has reshuffled the deck” for Democrats.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ned-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-07-04 17:05:17.539217

Jazon Gonzalez Perez, granted a $2,500 bond by a judge Wednesday in immigration court, was spotlighted in a recent Nebraska Examiner story. His friend and mentor, lifelong Nebraskan Richard Randall, Sr., described how his own support and view of President Donald Trump’s immigration strategy had shifted. 
Randall said the arrest of his “little buddy,” Gonzalez Perez, “hit home” and did not represent the type of enforcement he had bought into when he voted for Trump last November. The case reflected stepped-up tactics at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration.
When arrested, Gonzalez Perez had been looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work. A cellphone search led him toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base. He was detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.

Base personnel called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Gonzalez Perez called Randall. 
As agents took Gonzalez Perez, Randall recalled saying, “Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. He’s none of those.”
Gonzalez Perez’s attorney, Erika Buenrostro, said her client was released on bond pending resolution of his civil case in immigration court. He is accused of unauthorized U.S. presence. Given the court backlog, local attorneys say such cases can take years to resolve.
Upon his release from nearly a month in jail, Randall said his buddy expressed gratitude for Plattsmouth area community members who showed support, and that Gonzalez Perez was happy to be home with family and friends.
“Our community spoke up for Jazon and he is touched by all of the support,” said Randall.

John C. Hughes is, at root, a storyteller. As he marks the end of a nearly six-decade career that spanned hot-type newspapering on the coast to crafting the biographical record of Washington’s political and civic leaders, he recognizes a shift in his own disposition. Once sanguine about civic life, even with all its faults, he finds himself in a funk at this time of transition — morose, melancholy, and discouraged.
As he prepares to retire, Hughes leaves behind a shelf full of books, countless oral histories, and a warning: The decline of journalism and civic memory threatens democracy itself.
His body of work began in his hometown, where he still lives. “Grays Harbor is one of those places that has terroir, a sense of place,” Hughes said, explaining his lifelong connection to the timber town of Aberdeen, where he spent 42 years at The Daily World, eventually rising to editor and publisher. He turned down jobs at larger newspapers, including offers from The Seattle Times, out of a commitment to community journalism. “There was something in my blood,” he said. “It’s where I think I belong.”
In a wide-ranging and often poignant conversation with Austin Jenkins on TVW’s Inside Olympia, Hughes said his career began as a reporter in the mid-1960s. Washington had dozens of small daily newspapers with vibrant newsrooms. The Daily World boasted a staff of 21 reporters at its peak. Today, Hughes noted, the paper employs just three journalists and its circulation has plummeted below 5,000. “We had three great photographers on staff, we did investigative work, we went toe to toe with the big-city papers,” he recalled.
The loss, he said, is not just in jobs or prestige. It’s civic. “There’s a direct line between the decline of newspapers and the decline of civic engagement,” Hughes said. “When people don’t know their own stories, they don’t know how to defend their communities.”
As chief historian for Legacy Washington, a project of the secretary of state’s office, Hughes transitioned from reporting the present to preserving the past. In that role, he conducted hundreds of interviews and authored or co-authored 17 books over 17 years, telling the stories of governors, judges, lawmakers, civil rights pioneers, and cultural figures, all of whom left an indelible mark on the state. His subjects include Gov. John Spellman, Sen. Slade Gorton, columnist Adele Ferguson, and former first lady Nancy Evans.
When asked which of his books he considers most consequential, Hughes pointed to “John Spellman: Politics Never Broke His Heart,” praising Spellman as a one-term Republican governor who vetoed a massive pipeline project out of environmental concern. “The Inimitable Adele Ferguson” stands out for its portrait of the legendary Bremerton political columnist who held Olympia’s feet to the fire. And “Slade Gorton: A Half Century in Politics” documents the arc of a brilliant, if polarizing, legal and political career.
His most recent book, “New Land,” co-authored with historian Ed Echtle, tells the story of Washington’s resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees after the Vietnam War. Hughes credits former Gov. Dan Evans, former Secretary of State Bruce Chapman and then special emissary to the governor Ralph Munro as exemplars of what he calls “latter-day profiles in courage.”
“These are stories that animate us toward citizenship,” he said. “They’re about people who did the right thing when it wasn’t easy.”
Despite working for a statewide elected official, Hughes has maintained a fierce sense of professional independence. “I am in no way a spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of State,” he said. “There hasn’t been a partisan litmus test, not once.”
His ability to write 17 books in 17 years? That, he said, comes from the rigors of daily journalism. “When you become an accomplished journeyman deadline reporter, then you can write quickly,” he said. “I just love storytelling.”
That storytelling instinct was reinforced early by Murray Morgan, the renowned historian and author of “Skid Road,” who once advised Hughes to “be a newspaperman first” to sharpen his writing and his instincts.
But along with the pride in his work comes melancholy. Hughes has written about many people who are now gone — including Gorton, Spellman and Ferguson. “My mom always said the best thing about people who were so alive when they were alive is that when they’re gone, it’s like they’re really still here,” he said. “But you still miss them.”
That sense of loss extends to institutions. Hughes mourned the state’s decision to shutter the Washington State Library and the Talking Book & Braille Library due to budget cuts. “I can’t think of anything more gratuitously stupid than to close a great cultural institution like the Washington State Library,” he said.
Looking back on his hometown, Hughes has also witnessed political realignment. Grays Harbor, once a Democratic stronghold, has voted for Donald Trump in three consecutive elections. Hughes was not surprised. “The grievance on Grays Harbor is that the Democratic Party has, in essence, said, ‘Let them eat cake.’”
He spoke of the disappearance of “lunch-bucket Democrats” — moderate, labor-aligned lawmakers like Sid Snyder, Jim Hargrove and Brian Blake. “A breed of Democrat that’s pretty much extinct at this point. Maybe [they’ve] gone the way of the spotted owl.”
Ultimately, Hughes worries about the future of democracy. “I believe these are perilous times for American democracy,” he said. “If we don’t understand our history — if we don’t teach civics and truth—then we lose the shared values that hold us together.”
After a career that spanned both headlines and history books, Hughes summed it up simply: “I count every day as a real blessing. And I get to tell these stories.” Affirming Morgan’s famous formulation, Hughes says, “Journalism is the sport of kings.”

He visited Stewpot Community Services during its daily free lunch hour Thursday to discuss new state laws, which took effect two days earlier, targeting Mississippians experiencing homelessness.
“I understand that you are going through some hard times right now. That’s why I’m here,” Wade said to the crowd. “I felt it was important to come out here and speak with you directly.”
Wade laid out the three bills that passed earlier this year: House Bill 1197, the “Safe Solicitation Act,” HB 1200, the “Real Property Owners Protection Act” and HB 1203, a bill that prohibits camping on public property. 
“Sleeping and laying in public places, you’re not going to be able to do that anymore,” he said. “There’s a law that has been passed that you can’t just set up encampments on public or private properties where it’s a public nuisance, it’s a problem.”
The “Real Property Owners Protection Act,” authored by Rep. Brent Powell, R-Brandon, is a bill that expedites the process of removing squatters. The “Safe Solicitation Act,” authored by Rep. Shanda Yates, I-Jackson, requires a permit for panhandling and allows people to be charged with a misdemeanor if they violate this law. The offense is punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 and an offender could face up to six months in jail. Wade said he’s currently working with his legal department to determine the best strategy for creating and issuing permits. 
“We’re going to navigate these legal challenges, get some interpretations, not only from our legal department, but the Attorney General’s office to ensure that we are doing it legally and lawfully, because I understand that these are citizens,” he said. “I understand that they deserve to be treated with respect, and I understand that we are going to do this without violating their constitutional rights.”

Wade said the Jackson Police Department is steadily fielding reports of squatters in abandoned properties and the law change gives officers new power to remove them more quickly. The added challenge? Figuring out what to do with a person’s belongings. 
“These people are carrying around what they own, but we are not a repository for all of their stuff,” he said. “So, when we make that arrest, we’ve got to have a strategic plan as to what we do with their stuff.” 
Wade said there needs to be a deeper conversation around the issues that lead someone to becoming homeless. 
“A lot of people that we’re running across that are homeless are also suffering from medical conditions, mental health issues, and they’re also suffering from drug addiction and substance abuse. We’ve got to have a strategic approach, but we also can’t log jam our jail down in Raymond,” Wade said. 
He estimates that more than 800 people are currently incarcerated at the Raymond Detention Center, and any increase could strain the system as the laws continue to be enforced.
“I think there’s layers that we have to work through, there’s hurdles that we are going to overcome, but we’ve got to make sure that we do it and make sure that my team and JPD is consistent in how we enforce these laws,” Wade said.
Diners applauded Wade after he spoke, in between bites of fried chicken, salad, corn and 4th of July-themed packaged cakes. Wade offered to answer questions, but no one asked any.
Rev. Jill Buckley, executive director of Stewpot, said that the legislation is a good tool to address issues around homelessness and community needs. She doesn’t want to see people who are homeless be criminalized, but she also wants communities to be safe.
“I support people’s right to self determine, and we can’t impose our choices on other people, but there are some cases in which that impinges on community safety, and so to the extent that anyone who is camping or panhandling or squatting and is a danger to themselves and others, of course, I fully support that kind of law. I don’t support homelessness being criminalized as such,” Buckley said.

Many of the people Wade addressed while they ate Thursday said they have housing, don’t panhandle, and shouldn’t be directly impacted by the legislation. But Marcus Willis, 42, said it would make more sense if elected officials wanted to combat the negative impacts of homelessness that they help more people secure employment.
“There ain’t enough jobs,” said Willis, who was having lunch with his girlfriend Amber Ivy.
The two live in an apartment together nearby on Capitol Street, where Ivy landed after her mother, whom Ivy had been living with, suffered a stroke and lost the property. Similarly, Willis started coming to eat at Stewpot after his grandmother, whose house he used to visit for lunch, passed away.
Willis holds odd jobs – cutting grass, home and auto repair – so the income is inconsistent, and every opportunity for stable employment he said he’s found is outside of Jackson in the suburbs. The couple doesn’t have a car.
Making rent every month usually depends on their ability to find someone to help chip in, said Ivy, who is in recovery from substance abuse. She said she’s watched problems surrounding homelessness grow over the years in Jackson. Ivy grew up near Stewpot and has lived in various neighborhoods across the city – except for the times she moved out of state when things got too rough.
“There was just moments where I just had to leave,” Ivy said. “Sometimes if you hit a slump here, there’s almost no way for you to get out of it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03143348/Chief-Wade-at-Stewpot-4.jpg,,,2025-07-04 14:09:32.645224

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, announces his 2026 campaign for governor during an event on June 30, 2025, at the David Lust Accelerator Building in Rapid City. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s entry into the 2026 race for South Dakota governor launches him into a Republican primary in which a competitor is making allegiance to President Donald Trump a main issue.
Johnson announced his candidacy Monday with a pledge to focus on “addition and multiplication” rather than division and anger. That same day, a political action committee issued a statement accusing Johnson of being insufficiently loyal to Trump.
“Dusty Johnson is South Dakota’s Never-Trumper-In-Chief,” said Drew Dennert, chairman of Dakota First Action.

The group was founded by Toby Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman who announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor in May. On Tuesday, some South Dakotans received a large postcard from Doeden’s campaign featuring a photo of a bloody Trump after an assassination attempt, with the headine “Will you answer President Trump’s call?”
The other declared Republican candidate for governor is the speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, who announced in April. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden — who is serving the remainder of Kristi Noem’s term after she resigned for a post in the Trump administration — has not announced whether he’s running.
Johnson said accusations that he’s not supportive of Trump “are not criticisms I generally hear these days.”
“We’re in a political environment where people love to level accusations. And the reality is, I kind of reject the labels,” Johnson said. “I’m just a conservative who’s trying to get things done. And clearly, that means working with President Trump, and we’ve got a great working relationship. He’s had me down in Mar-a-Lago. He’s had me at the Super Bowl. We talk regularly about policy.” 
Johnson, 48, is a married father of three from Mitchell who is currently serving his fourth term as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The following conversation with Johnson has been edited for length and clarity.
Why do you want to be South Dakota’s governor instead of its congressman? 
I love the state. I think the next 20 years for South Dakota could be the best in our history, but I don’t think that’s a sure thing. I think to realize that future, we need a real plan. I think we need real leadership, and I’m excited to be the person who pulls together that plan and pulls together that team. 
In many respects, I think the challenges facing South Dakota right now are the right fit for my skill set. 
Some Republicans claim you are not a “real” conservative. How will you address that? 
The proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, the Republican voters get a say. The Republican voters like the job I do, they understand the conservative and pragmatic worldview that I bring to my work, and they like it. 
You voted to certify the 2020 election and voted against Trump’s border wall emergency declaration during his first term. How will you address accusations that you don’t support the president?
Those are not criticisms I generally hear these days. I mean, I think if you were to ask Chat GPT to gather up all of the political articles of the last two years, I think one narrative would be that Dusty Johnson is just too close to Donald Trump. 
I don’t try to be any particular type of Republican. I just try to be a conservative who gets things done. 
The whole label conversation is kind of ridiculous. It maybe tells you what a dysfunctional age we’re in that I can be an architect of some of the major successes of the House in the last seven months — securing the border, cutting spending and reforming welfare — and somehow, for some people, that’s not enough.
Trump’s cuts to the federal government have resulted in South Dakota’s state government losing $24 million thus far, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management. You’ve been generally supportive of those cuts. How would you address that lost funding as governor?
Anytime the federal government cuts anything, there is a narrative that the sky is falling. And clearly, some of these cuts are uncomfortable, and I don’t want to be cavalier about them. I mean, these are real programs that matter. And yet, $24 million out of a $7 billion state budget is about one-third of 1% of the state budget. 
South Dakotans are resilient enough. We’re resourceful enough to be able to tighten our belt and still get the important things done, even in the face of a federal government that absolutely must move toward fiscal responsibility. 
I’m proud of those fiscally responsible votes that I’ve taken. I know they’re not always easy, but if we don’t take care of business, our country will go bankrupt.

What areas of state government would you first look at when considering cuts?
Number one, we do need to cut property taxes. And unlike some, I think we need to do it in a responsible way that protects those core services and roads, bridges, cops and schools. 
Number two, we need to make college and technical school more affordable. And we need to double down on the programs and the research that really moves South Dakota forward. 
In K-12, we need to be relentless about student achievement. We are not talking enough about student achievement. We need to set real goals, we need to use real data. We can’t be afraid to lead. 
We need to focus more on drugs and addiction if we want safer communities. We need new interdiction teams, and we need smarter training and treatment within the walls of our prisons. 
And we need to grow this economy so we can keep taxes low. That’s going to come from new small businesses, new energy production, dairy expansion and bringing high-tech jobs home to South Dakota. 
How would you go about cutting property taxes? 
I think we need to focus our property tax relief on the owner-occupied residential, and really, the farmer-managed ag property. 
We have plenty of out-of-staters who own plenty of property in South Dakota, and I’m just not as interested in giving them a tax break. 
Several failed bills last legislative session in Pierre aimed to create some form of school vouchers using public funds to support non-public educational options. Would you support legislation to establish a voucher program?
I’m a big supporter of educational choice and properly funding our public schools. 
I’ve got three sons who are products of public schools, and our Mitchell schools have done an incredible job with my boys. 
We’re very involved parents. We spend a lot of time focusing on what they’re learning. And I think the quality of the education is excellent. And I think, as long as we are properly funding our public school systems, then I think we’re allowed the flexibility to ask if there are other educational opportunities that we can invest in as well.
Last legislative session, lawmakers passed and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill banning eminent domain — a legal process for obtaining land access — for carbon dioxide pipelines. As governor, how would you have navigated that?
It’s not my interest in re-litigating every decision that the last administration has done. Fundamentally, this has got to be a forward-looking campaign. And so I just don’t know that there’s any benefit in me being critical of anything that Governor Rhoden has done. 
South Dakota has long struggled with workforce shortages in health care and child care. How would you address these chronic issues? 
First off, let’s put this into context: This is not a South Dakota problem. It’s a problem in South Dakota, but it’s a problem everywhere. Literally, every one of the 50 states has chronic and severe workforce shortages in child care and health care. 
So, I think we need to be honest with ourselves that this is going to take a multi-year, focused effort to solve. This is, in part, closing the skills gap. I think we need to identify people who can go into those fields and do a better job of getting them the education they need. 
There is no silver bullet. It will be 100 solutions that address this problem, not one big one. 
President Trump has deployed military forces on U.S. soil during protests without state consent, attempted to redefine birthright citizenship by executive order, fired independent inspectors general, deported people allegedly without due process, threatened to annex Canada and Greenland, and intimidated dissenting media. What do you say to protesters in South Dakota worried that America is moving toward authoritarianism?
We have to care about the rule of law. And so, what does the rule of law mean? That means that you only get to do those things that are lawful exercises of power. 
Here’s what we know: The federal judiciary has said that the way the president handled the birthright citizenship case is permissible for now; they have said that his use of the National Guard is permissible for now; the firing of independent inspectors general was also permissible.
And so, it’s an interesting allegation for people to say that the president is being an authoritarian when he is following court orders. He has won in these court cases. 
I feel like it would be inappropriate for him to ignore a federal court order, but he hasn’t. He’s been winning these things, so it’s an odd accusation for them to make that he’s the one who is violating the rule of law.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2550-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 13:14:23.133911

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will be $70.92 this year, 30 cents less than last summer but the second-highest cookout cost since 2013 when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops saw the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Cans of pork and beans had the steepest increase, up 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 it cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in that time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.

The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, the U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the South — which includes Maryland, in the Farm Bureau report — where a party of 10 can be fed for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher earnings for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about 16 cents per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from the Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done — work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

Wes Moore said the state will find a new location for its planned $7 million cannabis incubator project, after local opposition to the original choice at the Maryland National Guard’s William J. Witte Armory in Catonsville.
In a statement Wednesday, Moore said that after further review of the project, he decided that the state “should explore new options” for the incubator’s location. The three agencies leading the project — the Maryland Cannabis Administration, the Department of General Services and the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO) — will immediately begin a new search process to find potential sites.
“As part of their site review, I have instructed the agencies to identify locations that are not within close proximity to residential communities and schools,” Moore wrote. “The agencies will begin this new process immediately, conduct extensive community and stakeholder engagement, and work quickly to move the project forward.”
The announcement comes after the incubator’s planned location drew opposition in recent weeks from some local residents because the site is in a residential area and close to a nearby elementary school, a temple and a day care center.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Catonsville resident Josh Jackson launched a Change.org petition in early June opposing the project and calling for greater transparency from the state throughout the process. The petition notes potential problems of having the incubator in the community, including security concerns from the site’s cannabis storage, nuisance smells and traffic issues.
“Whether or not you support cannabis rights, creating a cannabis incubator, or spending up to $7 million on such a project, the community where this business is to be located should have been informed and should have had their input considered,” the petition read. “There are plenty of other opportunities in the State to create a safe and secure space for business growth in existing commercial or industrial areas after clear communication and public input.”
In a December 2023 report, MEDCO listed 37 locations across the state which were submitted for consideration and reviewed as potential sites for the incubator. Notably, the armory was not included on that list of potential locations.
The project aims to be the country’s first-ever state-owned cannabis incubator. Up to 110 microbusinesses would be able to use the incubator to securely store their product before delivery or to process cannabis products using the building’s shared commercial kitchen and equipment, according to written

His statements from that time may inform the present moment.
Sherman was a key figure in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution, and the amendments that came to be known as the Bill of Rights. He also revised the Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut in 1784, including an Abstract and Declaration of the Rights and Privileges of the People of this State, asserting that Connecticut “shall forever be and remain a free, sovereign and independent State … under the sole authority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince whatever.”


Also in 1784, Roger wrote in defense of the Articles of Confederation, “The Honorable Continental Congress have taken due care to secure the rights of the separate states,” and “Each state retains its SOVEREIGNTY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE, and every power, jurisdiction and right, not expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.”
In the Connecticut Courant in 1788, Sherman wrote, “The immediate security of the civil and domestic rights of the people will be in the governments of the particular states. And as the different states have different local interests and customs which can best be regulated by their own laws, it would not be expedient to admit the federal government to interfere with them any further than necessary for the good of the whole.”
Sherman was also concerned about executive power. He believed that the President of the United States should be “nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect,” and he “was against enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole,” as the legislature “was the depository of the supreme will of the Society.”
Despite these early warnings, our history has found it expedient to admit federal interference in the states and to relinquish powers to the President. Now that interference, and the abdication of power by the legislature, threaten the security of the civil and domestic rights of the people in Connecticut. The current federal administration is testing the limits of executive authority with orders that violate the most basic individual rights despite Connecticut’s own strong guarantees to equal protection and due process.
Concerns about the erosion of civil-rights protections by devolution under a new federalism assume that federal protections are stronger than the protections offered by the state. This moment in Connecticut turns that argument on its head. Though the Fourteenth Amendment enabled the United States to impose civil rights to emancipation, equal protection, public education, and accommodations for disabilities, among others, the same “power to enforce” now brings regressive and repressive federal actions.
Under a new progressive federalism, Connecticut can be a safe haven of civil rights for our residents. If there are any federal protections that exceed those assured by our state laws and Constitution, then we can ask our General Assembly and our governor to enact those protections here. I have greater confidence in our assembly in Hartford than in the Congress at Washington, D.C.
I wonder, what would Sherman say?

Though the Fourteenth Amendment enabled the United States to impose civil rights to emancipation, equal protection, public education, and accommodations for disabilities, among others, the same “power to enforce” now brings regressive and repressive federal actions.
Under a new progressive federalism, Connecticut can be a safe haven of civil rights for our residents. If there are any federal protections that exceed those assured by our state laws and Constitution, then we can ask our General Assembly and our governor to enact those protections here. I have greater confidence in our assembly in Hartford than in the Congress at Washington, D.C.
I wonder, what would Sherman say?

(USDA photo courtesy of Humane World for Animals) An Iowa-based animal welfare organization has conducted what may be the first nationwide study of regulatory violations among dog breeders who supply brokers and retailers with animals.
The study shows that more than half of the breeders or brokers who supply retail stores with puppies, and who have been tracked over the past three years by the nonprofit organization Bailing Out Benji,  have been cited for regulatory violations.
Mindi Callison, executive director of the Iowa-based nonprofit organization, says that for decades, there has been a lack of data surrounding the pet-acquisition industry — particularly with regard to the complicated intersection of breeders, brokers and sellers.

To address that issue, Callison says, Bailing Out Benji has widened its scope of research from federally licensed breeders who sell to pet shops to include state-licensed breeders and dealers as well as online sellers and the brokers who act as “middle men” in the trafficking of animals.
The research, she says, paints a fuller picture of the issues that the commercial dog-breeding world faces, and is the first of its kind. It’s based on an analysis of five years of data on the thousands of breeders who are licensed at the federal and state level, plus three years of data on the breeders who supply pet stores.
“For the first time ever, the commercial dog breeding and sales industry has been audited,” she said. “These facts and figures will allow for us to track progress on the national level, while giving us a more clear picture on where the problem areas are so they can be addressed.”

She said the first step toward meaningful change is having a clear understanding of the scope of the problem. “This data will be a game changer for those who are passionate about using real facts to drive that change for animals and the people who love them,” she said, adding that the data will help her and others track progress when advocates and lawmakers are trying to pass legislation related to animal welfare.
The data, Callison said, provides national averages for regulatory violations among licensed breeders, the breeders and brokers who supply pet stores, the breeders who supply third-party brokers, and the breeders and brokers who sell through online websites.
She said that in Iowa, specifically, about 33% of the brokers and breeders licensed at the state and federal level have been cited for regulatory violations at some point in the past five years.

“That is slightly lower than what we are seeing as the national average and is based on 678 facilities we are tracking in Iowa — which includes breeders who recently canceled their licenses after they had violations,” she said. “On the pet-store side, we are seeing that 28% percent of the breeders in Iowa that have sold to pet stores in the last three years have had violations.”
Among the study’s national findings:
— Violations by breeders: 41% of the licensed breeders have incurred state or federal violations during the past five years.
— Breeders to stores: 36% of the 1,946 licensed breeders who directly supplied pet stores in the last three years have incurred state or federal violations.
— Breeders to brokers: 34% of the breeders found to be supplying brokers in the last three years had incurred state or federal violations. Callison notes that this finding is based on preliminary data that may be updated since it does not reflect every breeder who sells through brokers.
— Puppy stores: 63% of the 542 puppy stores that have been tracked over the last three years have purchased puppies from breeders or brokers with known regulatory violations. This data excludes stores with common, shared ownership and which don’t receive shipments directly from the breeders or brokers.
— Online sales: 42% of the licensed breeders known to be supplying online brokering websites or online marketplaces have incurred state or federal violations. This data doesn’t capture every breeder who sells through an online broker, with Callison noting that some breeders who sell through such websites are unlicensed.
With regard to the online brokers and the unlicensed breeders who supply them, Callison said Bailing Out Benji is currently tracking thousands of unlicensed breeders and is in the process of auditing more than 20,000 online sellers who traffic animals through three brokering websites.
Once Bailing Out Benji has more conclusive data to share on that universe of sales, she said, the organization will update its reporting.

According to the Iowa Board of Mental Health Professionals, Abigail Doerder, 43, who practiced social work in Nevada and currently lives in Boone, is charged with negligence in the practice of the profession, unethical conduct, and violating the terms of an agreement or contract with the Impaired Practitioner Review Committee.
As is usually the case when charges are filed by Iowa’s licensing boards, the Board of Mental Health Professionals has not publicly disclosed the nature of the alleged conduct, or when it may have occurred.
It’s not clear what impact the charges might have on Doerder’s licensing status since, according to the board, her license expired in December 2024.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9, 2025. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Doerder for comment.
Court records show that in 2022, Doerder was arrested and charged with driving while barred as a habitual offender. Boone County prosecutors later amended the charge to the misdemeanor offense of improper taillights and Doerder was fined $30.
That case followed a 2018 incident in which Doerder was arrested in the parking lot of the Boone County Hospital and charged with third-offense drunken driving.

(Photo provided by Bullets and Bandaids)Since publishing its first volume more than a decade ago, Bullets and Bandaids has worked with more than 100 veterans, mostly from South Carolina, giving them a platform to share their experiences through written stories and art.
And in the last two years, the organization has reached some 60,000 people through traveling art shows and events around the state and country.
Now, the veteran-founded nonprofit is preparing to launch its fifth edition. Supporters gathered in Columbia ahead of the July Fourth holiday to celebrate and raise the funds to make it happen.
“The amount of healing that we have done is wild,” founder Robert LeHeup told the SC Daily Gazette.
LeHeup was among the first groups of United States Marines to push into Afghanistan following 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. His unit helped take control of the Kandahar airport in 2001 and then secured the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.
LeHeup left the Marine Corps in 2004 as a sergeant, returning to South Carolina and enrolling at the University of South Carolina, where he earned a writing degree and began working with different media forms.
“I was dealing with the same issues as so many other veterans when they first get back, which is violence and anger without a place to put it — substance abuse, depression, suicidal ideation — and I hadn’t even really addressed it,” he said.
Then, about 13 years ago, LeHeup gave a talk in Columbia. He spoke about a snowy night on patrol during his final weeks in Kabul. His unit was on high alert after they were told there could be members of the Islamic militant group Al-Qaeda in a nearby home. What LeHeup heard drifting over the embassy walls instead was music from a man playing a homemade flute. He stood listening to the man’s song and icicles like wind chimes in the trees as snowflakes fell around him.
“In the writing of it, I gained a sense of ownership over the story,” LeHeup said. “But that wasn’t anything compared to after I had performed it, because that’s when I knew that my story had been heard. This profound sense of isolation, which had caused all of these different problems, was being addressed through my telling of the story and knowing that people had heard it.”
He started Bullets and Bandaids to give other veterans a similar experience.
LeHeup records interviews with veterans, friends and family. Then, that recording is fact checked and shared with a volunteer writer, often someone who has not been in the military, who turns it into a written story. Finally, an artist will create a painting, music poetry or other work of art inspired by the story.
“We’ve had people say things like, I wouldn’t have been able to tell my wife this story were it not for Bullets and Bandaids. I’m still alive today because you guys are continuing to tour. I wouldn’t be here were it not for the connections that I had made,” LeHeup said.
By pairing veterans with civilian writers and artists, LeHeup said the group also works to bridge the divide that often exists between military members and those without a military connection.
“I think veterans are forced to be in one of two boxes, either they are broken or they are heroes that need nothing,” LeHeup said. “I believe that our humanity, our lives, are in the gray area in between. And I hope that civilians will recognize that we live in that gray area, and that both civilians and veterans find the strength in acknowledging that shared human journey.”
Kristine Hartvigsen, of Columbia, was never in the military herself but her father spent his career in the U.S. Army as a physician. Her aunt was an Army nurse during the war in Vietnam. Her son enlisted, too, deploying twice — in 2017 to Afghanistan and last year to Syria — and currently stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia.
“I do have just a real strong affinity for veterans and am trying to understand my son’s experience better by learning from other vets, because he was definitely changed when he came home,” Hartvigsen said.
About four years ago, she volunteered as a writer for Bullets and Bandaids after learning about it from a friend.
“What I really hear is the stuff that I think about when my son is deployed. I’m trying to picture where he is, what he sees, what he’s doing. So it’s the little details that veterans share,” Hartvigsen said.
One story that particularly stuck with her came from Corey Norrell, a self-proclaimed Navy brat who enlisted when he turned 18. He told her about a rite of passage in the U.S. Navy, known as the crossing the line ceremony, held when a sailor crosses the equator for the first time and becomes a “trusty shellback” or a “Son of Neptune.”
The “shellbacks” crawl on their hands and knees across the non-skid deck with a surface so rough “sandpaper doesn’t hold a candle to it,” he said.
“It’s not a combat story, but it’s part of the experience, because there’s a brotherhood and sisterhood that forms among military service members,” Hartvigsen said.
Hartvigsen said her son prefers not to speak about his deployments but she does remember talking to him on the phone and him telling her he could see enemy soldiers in the distance from the wall he was standing on.
“It was just shocking to me that he could see them across the way. But unless they fire, they’re all just watching each other and that’s stressful in itself, just not knowing what’s going to happen,” Hartvigsen said.

Unlike Hartvigsen, Andrew Cooke was in the military — the U.S. Air Force — and also produces art for Bullets and Bandsaids.
Cooke retired from the Air Force as a staff sergeant in 2012 after developing a heart condition following an injury sustained during an attack on Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, where he was deployed in 2010. He’d also done earlier tours in Kandahar and Al Dahfra, in the United Arab Emirates.
After leaving the Air Force, Cooke took up photography as part of therapy. He particularly liked photographing storms and landscapes near his home in Tucson, Arizona. Being in nature and away from crowded spaces calmed him.
The Darlington native then moved back to South Carolina and currently lives in Spartanburg, working as a construction manager. He still does photography on the side.
Cooke, who is now on the board of directors for Bullets and Bandaids, finds value in how the organization connects civilians and veterans and the level of appreciation that develops between the soldiers and their story tellers.
Cooke said Bullets and Bandaids needs financial help from the community to keep going. The organization is supported both by private donations and government grants, including a $10,000 grant from the state Arts Commission for 2025 and $10,000 from the state Humanities Council in 2024.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/480254257_958379533058526_6374661688534519078_n-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

Usher, wh[...]","The door to the Senate Chamber at the Montana Capitol. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, is alleging political and sex discrimination by Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings area, against members of the public and another Democratic legislator.
Dunwell is making the allegations with the Montana Human Rights Bureau, which enforces laws that prohibit discrimination as part of the Department of Labor and Industry.
Usher, who served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he does not believe the bureau has jurisdiction.
However, if it does, Usher said he expects to prevail — as he did in a similar case Dunwell filed during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
In a summary of initial allegations Dunwell submitted to the Human Rights Bureau, Dunwell argues Usher’s behavior constituted unlawful discrimination against members of the public who testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and against Sen. Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, who served as vice chairwoman of the committee.
“There were numerous instances of Sen. Usher shutting down, belittling and verbally and emotionally abusing (members of the public and committee members) or silencing and refusing them questions, especially Minority Party Vice Chair of Judiciary Committee Andrea Olsen,” said the summary of allegations.
Olsen could not be reached for comment through voicemails left Wednesday and Thursday. The allegations also state she was treated unfairly after raising concern about the lack of public notice for a hearing.
Dunwell said the Human Rights Bureau initially accepted the case, and she is submitting additional material and may name more respondents.
Montana Human Rights Bureau Chief Tim Little could not be reached late Wednesday or Thursday about the status of the case.
In a description of its process, the Human Rights Bureau website said it will draft a formal complaint “if the facts indicate illegal discrimination may have occurred” following an intake interview.
The allegations Dunwell submitted to the agency and shared with the Daily Montanan cover incidents during the 2025 Montana Legislature when Usher led the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Senate Judiciary Committee reviews some of the most controversial bills of the session and often elicits emotional testimony.
The allegations include harassment, retaliation and discrimination based on political belief, sex, and gender identity by Usher “against others with less power than him.”
In an interview, Dunwell said members of the public have the right to share their opinions even if they run contrary to the political beliefs of the chairperson.
She also said she wants to set a standard for more respectful behavior at the Capitol in the future, and she believes women and people who are LGBTQ+ were especially abused.
“I’m going to come and go. He’s going to come and go,” Dunwell said of Usher. “At some point, we just need to say, ‘Stop,’ because we have devolved so much in our decorum and in our treatment of one another.”
The summary of allegations said at least 20 other members of the public and legislators relayed experiences of bullying and harassment by Usher but would not consent to have their names used for fear of retaliation.
In an interview, Usher said he doesn’t believe the Human Rights Bureau, part of the executive branch, has jurisdiction in the case because of the separation of powers. He also said he believes he has legislative immunity.
However, Usher said he treats everyone the same — “whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican or a male or a female.”
For example, Usher said in the past, he shut down Dunwell when he felt “she got out of control” at a hearing, but he also shut down Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell when he “went off the rails” as a bill sponsor.
As committee chairman, Usher said he enforces decorum. Some people at the podium aren’t familiar with the rules, and in those cases, he said he provides instruction to them to keep meetings on track.
“If we have decorum, then we can make it through our agenda,” Usher said.
Dunwell said an attorney advised her the case might butt up against a claim of legislative immunity. However, she said many people who were poorly treated by Usher during the session are quietly encouraging her to pursue the complaint.
An email from Dunwell to the Human Rights Bureau said political activist Evan Barrett will join her in alleging unfair treatment, and Barrett confirmed Thursday he believes Usher trampled on his right to participate and abused his power.
Barrett, a Butte Democrat, said when he tried to testify by video in a hearing against a bill to require judges to declare a political party, Usher cut off testimony. Barrett said he alerted Olsen that he — and later, he found out, a couple of others — still hadn’t testified.
Olsen alerted Usher, but the chairman refused to recognize him, Barrett said. Barrett said he later emailed Usher and informed him he was violating the state Constitution by suppressing the right to participate.
After “rattling his cage,” Usher finally relented and scheduled a time for Barrett and a couple of judges who had been left out to testify, Barrett said, but he said Usher then failed to allow Olsen to ask them questions, which is part of the process.
Barrett said he’s a “known commodity as a Democrat” in Montana, and he wonders if his political affiliation influenced Usher’s decision not to recognize him.
Usher said in general, people register in advance to testify, and if they aren’t on his list of registrants, he doesn’t call on them. He said he isn’t vetting lists for people’s political affiliations. He said in this case, a “software glitch” meant Barrett wasn’t on the list, but he testified at a later date.
In a narrative of the allegations, Dunwell outlined more than a dozen instances she said are just some examples of when Usher bullied or shut out the public, Olsen, and other committee members.
In one incident, Olsen tried to point out members of the public who had their hands raised to testify online. Usher said he did not see anyone, but Olsen said she saw at least two hands raised.
Usher said he’d been watching the computer for the last hour, and one person who had their hand raised wasn’t on the list of people who had signed up to testify, a prerequisite.
“I didn’t know if you wanted to do my job?” Usher says to Olsen.
“I’d be happy to, Mr. Chair,” Olsen replies.
“Well, actions have consequences,” Usher says.
In the allegations and phone interview, Dunwell said she had filed an earlier harassment and discrimination complaint against Usher during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
A Legislative Conduct Panel convened, directed an investigation be conducted, and confirmed the complaint was found to be unsubstantiated, according to a copy of the determination notice Dunwell shared.
It said Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, also made “informal complaints” regarding the same allegations.
The determination was signed by two Republican leaders, Senate President Matt Regier and House Speaker Brandon Ler, and two Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers and House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan.
Asked if the outcome of the Legislative Conduct Panel could indicate Usher’s behavior steps up to a line but doesn’t cross into discrimination, Dunwell said she doesn’t have enough information to know; Dunwell said she requested a copy of the investigation, but she was denied the file based on privacy even though Usher is a public figure.
She said she believes Usher retaliated against her as well by ensuring her bills didn’t pass after she raised concerns with HR.
Usher said he wouldn’t ever ask anyone to take votes they don’t believe in.
He said HR interviewed the parties involved, and the matter, as he sees it, comes down to decorum. He said he and Olsen have a good relationship outside of the committee and talk frequently.
However, in committee, he said, he had to quiet Olsen at times because she would offer longwinded testimony when it was time for questions.
“It appears that sometimes she can’t help herself,” Usher said.
During the session, Olsen had emailed Usher and other committee members in an attempt to ensure legislators were respectful and welcoming to the public and did not “lecture them, argue with them, shame them.”
Sent in late March, the email is part of the packet of materials Dunwell provided to the Human Rights Bureau and shared with the Daily Montanan.
In it, Olsen acknowledged she needed to do a better job of asking “to-the-point” questions, but she said all committee members owe the public respect and decorum.
“I am writing to request that we all remember our obligation to the public, to welcome them to our committee, to allow them to participate, and to hear what they have to tell us about their concerns and perceived consequences of a bill,” Olsen said in her letter.
Olsen forwarded the email to Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, and told him she wished she’d had sent it in January when the session started. She said people were afraid to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Without full public participation, we create bad law with blinders on,” Olsen said in the email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate_door_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

“There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago, when Congress passed the one big beautiful bill to make America great again,” Trump said.
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
The president told the crowd of more than 1,000 that “this whole two weeks has been incredible” – pointing to the budget reconciliation bill that passed earlier Thursday, recent U.S. military strikes on Iran and his administration reaching trade deals with other countries.
Trump announces UFC fight at White House
Though much of his speech to the crowd gathered reflected what Iowans may have heard at campaign rallies during recent caucus cycles, Trump’s first Iowa event since January 2024 was the start of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary. Organized by America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June, Trump said there will be a year of celebrations, including sporting events and fairs.
“Every one of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America250 and I even think we’re going to have a UFC fight,” he said.
Trump announced plans to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House as part of his America250 celebration. Trump said UFC CEO Dana White would be organizing the fight. According to a White House Pool report, Trump is “dead serious” about plans for a fight on White House according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
He also said he plans to bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country with the first event taking place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He announced these would culminate in a “giant patriotic festival” with exhibits from all 50 states displayed at the National Mall during the festival.
“We will be orchestrating what we’re calling The Great American State Fair and we’ll start right here in Iowa,” he said.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
Trump supporters emphasize trust
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Trump said he has delivered on many of his campaign promises through the budget reconciliation bill and other actions since taking office earlier in 2025.
“The people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take-home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion – the horrible invasion,” Trump said. “… Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud, and that’s what we’re doing. With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Tien Tran, a California dentist who flew to Iowa for the event, said he does not know all the details in the legislation but supports the measure.
“I don’t even know all the details but I know and I trust this president because he promised. Whatever he promised, he kept,” Tran said. “… President Trump has saved a lot of money for this country. President Trump with his executive order has saved a lot of lives.”
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote.
Though the four representatives did not speak at the event, Trump praised them as a “good group,” saying, “boy, they were so happy at that victory today.”
Trump says legislation planned to allow undocumented workers to stay
In addition to speaking on the budget reconciliation bill, Trump also highlighted legislation and executive action taken on immigration policy, talking about mass deportations under his administration.
However, he shared that there could be a potential caveat to some deportations of undocumented immigrants coming under his administration for people working in the agriculture sector who are not in the country legally. He said he is working with Noem and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on legislation that would allow undocumented workers to stay in the country if they  can get the support and backing of their employers, he said.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, ‘So we have a little problem, the farmers are losing a lot of people,’” he said. “And we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written. And let the farmers be responsible.”
He joked, “and if the farmers don’t do a good job, we’ll throw them the hell out of the country,” while adding he believed the media would not acknowledge the comment as sarcasm.
U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both spoke before Trump’s appearance, speaking about their support for the budget reconciliation bill. Grassley highlighted what he called his biggest contribution to the legislation as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee – saying he was a major backer for the provisions to increase funding for immigration enforcement and border security and for detention centers. These are all steps to “make America safe again,” Grassley said.
Ernst also talked about Republicans’ immigration policy, pointing to Trump signing the immigration bill that included “Sarah’s Law,” a provision requiring the detainment of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury.
This measure was named after Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowan killed by a drunk driver who was an immigrant who lacked legal status. Ernst said this measure passing was one of many actions taken by Trump she supports on immigration.
Protesters outside the US House make a last stand against the GOP megabill

Iowans gather to protest Trump visit
Around 100 people gathered outside of the fairgrounds Thursday evening with protest signs, upside down American flags and megaphones to protest the president’s visit to Des Moines.
One protester, Maureen Ogle of Ames, waved her flag rightside up and pumped a cane in the air as cars drove past, honking in support of the protesters.
Ogle said she flew a flag upside down during the entirety of Trump’s first term, but now she wants to “reclaim” the national symbol. 
“I want to save the Republic,” Ogle said. “The constitution has been demolished.”

We already know that in Iowa, at least 20 rural hospitals are seriously threatened with closing and six are almost certainly gone. The problem is greater than hospitals closing or individuals being denied immediate, necessary medical care. The impact is going to be felt by the communities that are home to those medical care centers.
Our challenge will be, as a state, how we handle the impact of loss for many of those on Medicaid coverage, and the drastic cutbacks on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The real proof of the magnitude of the problem is that nationwide, 70 million people are on Medicaid and 40 million are beneficiaries of SNAP.  Furthermore, the effect is even greater in rural states.
Our first concern must be for care centers and hospitals.  Hospitals are rather mysterious places by design. This is because the nature of the work is confidential. Everyone is entitled to privacy when treated medically. In addition, the institution funding is a total dark web with government payments, insurance coverage, write-offs, etc.  So, they exist somewhat in isolation from the rest of town.
But the individuals who work at hospitals are not a secret. They are your neighbors, shop at the same stores, serve on their church communities, coach the little league softball and baseball teams, send their kids to our schools, and take a place on the school board or city councils.
But when the hospital closes, they will be different because (a) they will be unemployed and (b) they will find work someplace else.  It is not just the medical staff, nurses, doctors, techs, and the bookkeepers who chase the insurance companies for reimbursement (may God have mercy on their souls), but the electricians, the administrative staff, and the janitors, all or most who will be moving on and taking their kids out of the rural public schools.
We need to face the reality of the situation now.  The impact of this legislation is going to affect more than the patient.  It is a body blow not only to employees but to the very town in which the hospital resides. Yes, the bill includes $50 billion for rural hospitals affected by Medicaid cuts. It’s not nearly enough.
The solution isn’t rocket science. Rural states, like Iowa, are going to have to find money to replace the lost revenue from a former Medicaid patient who shows up at the hospital for treatment without insurance coverage. Both Iowa law and most hospitals’ mission statement requires that the patient receive treatment.  This may surprise the proponents of kicking patients off Medicaid, which flies in the face of their belief that if coverage is cut, then people would just decide not to get sick.) We can’t just lock them out.
The approach needs to be systematic and focused first on the rural hospitals most at risk. We need to examine and reduce or eliminate the cost of a rule, regulation, or statute that is not essential to the practice of good medical care.
The utility costs of the individual institution should be examined and either the state or the utility should determine whether the fees charged can be reduced or even eliminated. It is better to have less revenue from the cost of the operation of the buildings than none.
The mission and resources assigned to the Iowa Economic Development Authority should be amended to target rural health care.  The state’s entire economic development budget, which goes to various agencies, is about $40 million for next year (and should be increased). While it is great to lure foreign business entities to our state or convenience those that are departing, our first priority should be state resources for Iowans first, then others. The truth is that a hospital in a smaller community is an asset and should not be thrown out because of this legislation.
Those are a few of the steps that we can take to overcome these new laws. I reason that if towns like Marshalltown, Greenfield, Parkersburg and others can overcome and rebuild after tornadoes, we can do the same with this economic windstorm.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hopsital-image-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

A sprinkle of rocking chairs, kitchen sinks and family photos in Mississippi Museum of Art’s “2025 Mississippi Invitational” exhibition pepper the galleries with near universal touchstones. Signs of love and signs of loss, frayed connections, conflicting expectations, notions of belonging and the creep of time come through in artworks, too, evoking the deeply personal relationships and complex emotional ties forged in that place called home.
The museum’s 14th biennial survey of recent works by contemporary visual artists living and working in the state opens a fresh window into Mississippi and into this particular moment. The exhibition is on view through Sept. 7.
Its 12 featured artists were selected from about 180 applications and 37 studio visits across the state. Guest curator TK Smith, an Atlanta-based writer, curator and cultural historian, drew on his conversations with artists in their studios and tapped into his own summer visits with grandparents in Mississippi for the exhibition’s “Call Home” theme.
“All of these artists are reaching out — reaching to connect in some way, either to their audiences, to other artists, to communities, for political reasons, personal reasons,” Smith said. “Everybody is just kind of yearning, and I think that is shaping the work that’s in the show.”
Both up-and-coming and established artists are among the show’s 12, with creations covering a broad swath of media. Painting, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, photography, film, assemblage, installation and more deliver a diverse, vibrant and provocative portrait of the state of art in Mississippi. Unfolding across three sections, or “three breaths” in Smith’s words, the exhibition explores home as a physical space, as a body and beyond, and artists’ works in each section showcase their individual range.
An actual phone opens the exhibition — the vintage Panasonic Easa-Phone telephone and answering machine in artist Emma Lorenz’s “You Have XX Messages.” Personal voicemails and audio from the Golden Record combine in Lorenz’s study of how technological progress can risk losing touch with the past, and how even content inaccessible in the moment is still proof of life, care and love.
Lush hues on handmade paper lend beauty, depth and inviting texture to domestic scenes in a suite of paintings by Ocean Springs artist Jerrod Partridge. An open fridge, a puddle of clothes, even a laundry room peek of a baby lulled to sleep by the dryer, put viewers right at home in the messy comforts of daily life. Other exhibition works highlight coastal natural surroundings and, in a nod to the much-traveled artist’s global home, a series of drawings from Italy. Partridge was awarded the Invitational’s Jane Crater Hiatt Artist Fellowship, a $20,000 grant that he will use to develop a series of paintings about communities within the Gulf Coast’s seafood industry.
Laser cut metal fronds arc up from a circle of sandbags, forming a prickly dome in “Garden Pavilion (Cutgrass)” by Connor Frew of Jackson. Inspired by a semi-aquatic grass with serrated leaves that can cut skin, Frew tucked in concepts of resilience and resistance in wilderness, likening the sandbags’ text to a search engine query of how to grow strong enough to destroy the blades (in stronger language). 
“It’s this idea of wild, unrestrained growth and collectivity as a means of resisting attempts at culling, or destroying a particular community.”
Wander through the large-scale pop-ups in Sue Carrie Drummond’s installation “My Mold Garden,” drawn from an artist book collaboration with a cultural anthropologist (digital copy of the book also on display). Post-heartbreak grief coupled with mold growth in the home became a journey to emotional self-help. 
“It puts you in the experience of someone who is dealing with slow breakdown, and then how they put themselves back together. And, the mold mimics that,” Drummond said, breaking down matter to raw material that can be re-used. 
“A Beautiful Snare,” another interactive installation, confronts ideas of femininity through the etymology of lace. Its maze of voile, chiffon, charmeuse and cotton panels deepen from white to reddish hues, with increasingly intense coil designs the farther inside you wander. Is it fragile or strong? A lure or a snare, enticement or entrapment, or maybe both?
Artist Alexis McGrigg’s works in photography, film and painting embody deep family and ancestral ties, as in “A Personal Constellation.” There, gold leaf signifies departed members in a collection of old family photographs, to moving effect. Those are the souls that have touched “The Beloved” (her term for a heaven-like space, or origin of humanity). 
“We have these people that are connected to us, that are no longer here,” McGrigg said, thinking of them as guardians who still watch over her.
A family photo finds a place, too, in Christina McField’s home scene installation, soothing in its details of a crocheted afghan on a rocking chair, worn books, antique table and the framed 1920s photo on its surface. It pictures her great-grandmother with her grandfather, then a small child, standing atop that very table. 
“I wanted to bring them back to life and honor them,” McField said, fondly recalling family visits to Philadelphia, Miss., as a child. “This is what I think about when I think about calling home.” 
Elsewhere in the exhibit, her sculptural triptych assembles architectural scraps — ceiling tiles, spindles, brackets — in a meditation on past lives, the erosion of time and enduring fragments of memory.
Groupings of Hattiesburg ceramicist Allen Chen’s remarkable vessels channel generations of ancestors and migratory patterns, from the “original tribe” of earthen-hued pairs to different colored and carved “offsprings” bearing the changes new environments bring. 
Forms are similar, “the bones” are the same, he said, but colors — a surface quality, like skin tone — are different. 
“Home is not really a static place. We would like it to be, but wherever you end up comes from long lines of people moving around.” 
Chen’s “Passage of the Spine,” with its concentric ceramic shapes suspended in a horizontal line, may call to mind ancient whale fossils. The shadow this large piece casts only heightens its dramatic appeal.
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” selected artists also include: Rylee Brabham, with sculptures and installations exploring gender and society, with a dash of humor; Kaleena Stasiak, with windsocks, mobile and folk warnings about the weather conveying whimsy and wisdom; Ashley Gates, whose touching installation overlays images of her late mother with projections of a solar eclipse; and documentary photographer Betty Press, whose eye for intimacy and design shines through in photos of home births, pairings of Kenyan and Mississippi storefronts and more.
Three larger-than-life sculptures by Jason Kimes of Laurel follow a life cycle through the galleries, each one bearing a name that, together, form Julius Caesar’s famous phrase. A fetal position baby in clear epoxy is the blank-slate start (“Veni’). The 8-foot striding figure in weathering steel, made of thousands of individually welded squares, carries the rusty patina of experience (“Vidi”) and a noble skull in polished stainless gleams at the exhibit’s close (“Vidi”).
 “You start with nothing. You build up all the way through until you end up with something praiseworthy,” Kimes described a lifespan. And then, “It’s the ultimate call home.”
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” is on view at the Mississippi Museum of Art, 380 S. Lamar St. in Jackson, through Sept. 7. Admission is $15 adults, $13 seniors 65-plus, $10 youth 6-17 and college students with ID. It is free for museum members, children 5 and younger, active military and families this summer, and for certain groups on designated days.

(Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ crime rate in 2024 reached its lowest mark in at least 20 years, according to recently released data, and some attribute the drop to law enforcement success.
Violent crimes saw a five-year low in 2024, and property crimes maintained a downward trend, per the Kansas Bureau of Investigation’s annual crime index report.
“We believe the collaborative efforts of law enforcement agencies throughout Kansas have an impact on bringing down crime, as does the public’s cooperation and assistance when major crimes are committed,” said KBI director Tony Mattivi.
The report has been published in some form at the KBI since 2003. It compiles data from local and state law enforcement agencies, creating a snapshot of the year’s crimes while reflecting greater trends when compared to past years.
A crime index rate is the number of recorded crimes per 1,000 people in a given year. Kansas’ rate decreased from 27 crimes per 1,000 people in 2023 to 23.3 in 2024. The report said it’s the lowest rate in more than 20 years.
“When assessing crime on a statewide basis, it is difficult to understand what drives crime from year to year because so many factors influence crime trends,” Mattivi said.
The state’s murder rate, for instance, fell below the 10-year average. With 117 murders in 2024, it marked a more than 25% decrease from 2023.
“Finding a common circumstance for these murders is difficult,” the report said, “as 46.2% of the reports indicated ‘unknown circumstance.’ ”
Murders in 2024 involved arguments, domestic violence and unknown suspects. Making up smaller fractions were illegal drug transactions, which totaled 2.6% of murders, and gang activity and drive-by incidents, which made up less than 1% of murders in 2024.
All crime categories decreased in 2024. Some numbers were fractions of pre-pandemic averages and others made history. Around 7,100 burglaries were reported in Kansas in 2024, the lowest number since 1966, when around 10,700 burglaries were reported, according to the report.
Wyandotte County had the highest reported crime index rate in the state, with nearly 47 crimes per 1,000 people. Sedgwick County was a close second with a rate of nearly 44. The lowest reported crime index rate in 2024 was 0.7 in Jewell County, though the county sheriff’s office only reported seven months out of the year.
The number of law enforcement officers employed in Kansas is inching closer to its pre-pandemic level of 3.84 officers per 1,000 people, according to data from the FBI. The number of employed law enforcement officers rose between 2023 and 2024 from 3.44 to 3.69.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach took credit for the decrease in crime rates, attributing it to his “law and order approach.”
“Kansans are less likely to be the victim of a crime today than at any time in the past 20 years,” Kobach said in a news release, which referred to him as Kansas’s chief law enforcement officer.
While crime has decreased nationally in the past three decades, Americans still worry just as much — if not more — about their safety and the presence of crime, according to Gallup polling.
Around half of Americans who participated in 2024 surveys worry about crime a great deal, and few are satisfied with policies addressing crime. Americans perceive that crime is growing in the areas where they live. Almost half of Americans polled in 2024 thought crime increased over the previous year, when crime nationwide has been on a steep downward trend since the 1990s.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05182023-officervigil-6-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

(Phot courtesy of the National Archives)Exactly 249 years ago, a group of flawed-yet-visionary men signed a document in Philadelphia that was (and remains) remarkable.
It founded a nation that’s been a beacon of hope to the entire world. Is America perfect? No, of course not, and it never has been. But the grand experiment that is American democracy is certainly worth celebrating.
So, we’re running the text of the Declaration of Independence in full as a reminder of the nation’s foundational ideals of freedom and equality. Before the cookouts and fireworks, read the reason for the holiday:  
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. – That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, – That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. – Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”
