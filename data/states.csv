(Photo by Getty Images)Kentucky lawmakers studying artificial intelligence have issued a slew of recommendations ahead of the next legislative session that include protections for minors exposed to AI online and state laws about the location of data centers.
The Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force concluded on Thursday its second round of studying how AI is used in Kentucky and other states. The task force also met last year during the legislative interim; several of its recommendations became law during the 2025 legislative session sponsored by co-chair Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington.
A memo with the latest findings was sent to Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne as well as members of the Legislative Research Commission after the meeting. 
Rep. Josh Bray, a Mount Vernon Republican who is the second co-chair of the task force, said that some of the recommendations are better suited to be addressed at the federal level, so the group is encouraging Kentucky’s congressional representatives to consider them. 
Democratic Caucus Chair Sen. Reggie Thomas, of Lexington, said that he supports most of the recommendations, particularly one that encourages lawmakers to acknowledge how AI can be harmful to children and consider policies to protect minors on social media platforms. However, he said he would “approve with some caution” recommendations regarding data centers. One recommendation said lawmakers should consider laws regarding the location of data centers and requirements they should meet. Another calls for considering policies pertaining to data centers’ need for “large amounts of water and power” and “more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency.” That recommendation calls for consulting with the Public Service Commission. 
Thomas added that while he is “for data centers” they should not be built without an environmental impact survey and considering an increased cost in power for local consumers because of data centers’ high demand for electricity. 
“I think if there’s an increased cost that comes with data center construction or use, then that data center should pay for that increased cost, not the current consumers or the current business users who were using it before the data center came online,” Thomas said. 
Bray said Thomas’ “concerns are the exact reason those sections were drafted.” Lawmakers want to make sure that consumers’ electric bills do not increase as a result of a data center, Bray continued. 
Kentucky could have a “boom” of data center projects on the horizon, as some supporters see them as an opportunity to bring more jobs and money to the state. However, some communities have opposed them because of their size and intrusiveness and due to higher costs for water and electricity as demand increases. 
The task force approved 10 recommendations, which are: 

Consider legislative changes to the Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Act to strengthen consumer protections as data collection processes change with the evolution of AI technology.
Consider changes to the AI acceptable use policy for all state agencies.
Consider legislative policies to promote collaboration among service providers, state agencies and state research universities for the shared use and study of Medicaid data sets for how Kentucky families can prevent certain diseases resulting in lowering health care costs to Medicaid. 
Acknowledge that AI technology may be harmful to minors and consider legislative policies for the protection of minors on social media platforms.
Acknowledge that AI may impact careers regulated by professional standards, and consider legislative policies in coordination with professional standards boards to discuss when and how AI should be used within their profession.
Create or facilitate the creation of an AI work group to serve as a collaborative platform to bring together state and local governments, educational institutions, healthcare providers, industry, and citizens to identify needs, collect data, develop artificial intelligence solutions, foster innovation and competitiveness, promote artificial intelligence literacy, and ensure trusted artificial intelligence development and governance for Kentucky.
Incorporate AI development and governance into existing standing committees’ jurisdiction.
Consider legislative policies for the location of data centers in Kentucky including minimum requirements for location and collaboration among local, state, and private entities. 
Consider legislative policies for data centers’ need for large amounts of water and power requiring more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency, including consultation with the Public Service Commission. 
Encourage Kentucky’s federal delegation to work on national policies for AI as it impacts individual Kentuckians:

name, image, and likeness property rights;
consumer protection;
data protection from retail companies and data-driven pricing; and
small business economic issues from a patchwork of state laws.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)In a decisive rebuke of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an immigration judge on Wednesday ordered the agency to release a young immigrant held at a Virginia detention center — one day after the same court ordered the release of two brothers at the center of a class-action challenge to ICE’s treatment of Special Immigrant Juvenile Status applicants.
The two brothers, both in their late teens, were ordered released on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the court granted release to a third young immigrant in the same age group who, like the brothers, entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and later applied for SIJS, a pathway toward permanent legal protection. All three had been detained since August. 
“These young brothers came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and cannot safely return to their home countries after it was determined that they were abused, abandoned, or neglected,” said ACLU of Virginia Legal Director Eden Heilman in a statement. 
“Federal law says they have every legal right to be in the United States, and that ICE should never have put them in a detention center. Now they will finally be freed from detention and reunited with each other.”
ICE has not commented publicly on the Virginia rulings, and agency representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
 A legal pathway ignored

Congress almost four decades ago created SIJS to give vulnerable children a path toward lawful permanent residency. The process requires a state court to determine that the child cannot safely return to their country of origin, followed by a visa application and, eventually, an adjustment to citizenship. 
Those granted or applying for SIJS are not typically subject to mandatory detention.
Yet, the class-action complaint, filed in October by the ACLU of Virginia and partner counsel in the Alexandria Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, contends that ICE, under current policies, is treating SIJS-eligible youth as “arriving noncitizens” who must be detained without bond — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the U.S. Constitution.
“Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. The federal judge’s ruling confirmed that ICE is not,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg. “By ignoring the legal process Congress established decades ago, ICE is causing the very chaos and confusion that the Trump administration claims it’s working to fix.”
The federal judge’s order requires ICE to provide bond hearings to the named plaintiffs and bars the government from denying bond or invoking automatic stays if bond is granted.
The immigration court’s Tuesday order released the two brothers, both of whom arrived in the U.S. as minors and have SIJS applications or approvals. They were being held at the Caroline Detention Facility and the Farmville Detention Facility, both of which typically house adults.
On Wednesday, the court ordered a third plaintiff released — another client of the ACLU-VA who also entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and is eligible for SIJS protections. That ruling marked at least the second time this week the court rejected ICE’s argument that SIJS-eligible youth may be detained without bond.
 A broader trend

Virginia’s case reflects a nationwide surge of litigation over ICE’s increasingly aggressive detention of immigrants — including youth with protected statuses — without access to bond hearings. For example, in Massachusetts, a federal judge recently certified a class action challenging denials of bond hearings to immigrants held without inspection.
In New Bedford, Mass., a judge last month ordered the release of an 18-year-old SIJS recipient held in a county facility despite his protected status.

A July 2025 memo from ICE declared that undocumented immigrants who entered without inspection could be detained throughout their removal proceedings — often months or years — without access to bond hearings.
“These cases show the growing force of legal challenges to ICE’s detention practices,” the Amica Center wrote after a separate court ruling this fall. 
 What’s at stake 

Over the summer, immigration‐enforcement tactics in Virginia spurred widespread public protest. 
Dozens gathered outside rallies organized by the Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality, calling for an end to local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement following a wave of “masked, unmarked” detentions in the region.
In June and July, activists confronted courthouse raids in Chesterfield County and other sites, decrying what they described as “abduction-style” arrests of immigrants — many without criminal records. These protests underscored mounting local resistance as Virginia communities grapple with the human impact of enforcement policies.
For the three young immigrants now ordered released, the rulings mean freedom from detention and the chance to continue the SIJS process outside a jail setting. 
But the broader class-action lawsuit remains in early stages, and thousands of other SIJS-eligible youth nationwide remain subject to detention policies advocates say misinterpret federal law.
Advocates warn that prolonged detention can inflict long-term psychological harm on young people who have already survived trauma. Courts across the country are increasingly being asked to determine whether the lack of bond access violates due-process guarantees for youth whose presence in the U.S. is legally protected.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Some Republicans in New Hampshire want the state’s Medicaid work requirements to go further than the requirements being implemented nationwide.
In an effort led by Rep. Jim Kofalt, of Wilton, Republicans want to ban self-attestation as an option for determining eligibility under the new work requirements, which means Medicaid enrollees would need to provide quarterly documentary proof of employment rather than attesting to their work status.
Medicaid is the nation’s public health care program, run jointly by the state and federal governments, for people with low income and unique needs. Congress mandated work requirements for the program when it passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Donald Trump’s signature legislative priority in his second term, in July. Under the new law, Medicaid enrollees must work 80 hours per month in order to receive coverage.
Meanwhile, state-level Republicans also passed Medicaid work requirements as part of the new state budget.
Kofalt proposed an amendment to the new state law that would not only ban self-attestation but require Medicaid enrollees to work three continuous months before they can receive coverage. However, New Hampshire Medicaid Director Henry Lipman and other Medicaid officials said during a House Health and Human Services Committee meeting Wednesday that Kofalt had agreed to rework the amendment without that three-month look-back.
The work requirements will apply only to Medicaid enrollees in the Granite Advantage program, also known as Medicaid expansion, which covers the highest income groups eligible for Medicaid. The work requirements provide exceptions for “medical frailty” and “special needs” as “medically certified by a statement” from a medical professional.
Lawmakers will seek to avoid mistakes the state made last time it tried to implement Medicaid work requirements. In 2018, the state mandated that Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. About one month after the effective date of the rule, the state reversed course and then-Gov. Chris Sununu paused the requirements. Only 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement had complied and documented their hours. The rest were set to lose coverage before Sununu intervened. Leading up to the reversal, the state had spent over $130,000 in outreach efforts to teach people what the requirements were and how to complete the paperwork to prove they were working.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lipmanmedicaid-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 13:57:44.197726

“I can’t in good conscience vote for something that further damages an already broken health care system,” Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said in a statement.

The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation all voted against a deal that ended the federal government shutdown because it did not include most Democrats’ key demand throughout the impasse: an extension of health insurance tax credits. 
President Donald Trump signed the measure into law late Wednesday, just hours after the House passed it, 222-209. Six House Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the proposal; Vermont’s U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., was not among those who crossed party lines.
“I’m a hell no,” Balint said in a statement following the vote. “I can’t in good conscience vote for something that further damages an already broken health care system.”
The spending package will keep the federal government’s lights on through the end of January 2026. It will fund the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, military construction projects and Congressional operations through September 2026.
The deal also provides full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as SNAP’s program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, through September 2026.
“From the beginning Trump has used the shutdown as a political game — from withholding food from children to harassing air traffic controllers who take on second jobs to make ends meet,” Balint said. “This bill is just another way to ram through his corrupt agenda.” 
A breakthrough in the shutdown, which had reached its 43rd day on Wednesday, first emerged in the Senate. Last weekend, eight members of that chamber’s Democratic caucus came to a deal with GOP leaders to support a temporary funding package with an understanding that the Senate would hold a vote on extending the health insurance credits next month.
But it’s far from clear that such a vote will be successful in the Senate, and even less likely the measure would be taken up in the House or signed by Trump.
Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch both voted against the deal when it was up for approval in the Senate on Monday. They’ve both said they have little confidence that a vote on extending the subsidies — a Covid-19-era expansion of tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care Act — would be successful.
The subsidies help millions of low- and middle-income people across the country afford the cost of their health insurance premiums. In Vermont, the credits apply to plans available through the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, called Vermont Health Connect. 
Without them, tens of thousands of people in Vermont would see their health care costs skyrocket, and many would likely no longer be able to afford coverage. Barring new congressional action, the enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of 2025.

“I cannot vote for a government funding bill that kicks millions of Americans off their health care,” Welch said in a statement after Monday’s Senate vote. 
“There was an early recognition from my Republican colleagues that working families, small businesses, and farmers in their states would be really hurt by these premium increases — just as they will be in Democratic states, too,” he added. “That’s why it is so disappointing that Republicans refused to come to the table to extend the Affordable Care Act’s premium tax credits.”

McGuire, who terms out of the Legislature next year, hopes to capitalize on Democrats’ new voter registration advantage in LaMalfa’s post-Prop. 50 district to flip a congressional seat from red to blue. His launch video appears to preemptively address the criticism that he’s out of touch with rural Californians. 


California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire has officially launched his challenge to longtime Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa in a congressional district drastically redrawn by Proposition 50. 
The Santa Rosa Democrat, who will hit his 12-year term limit in the Legislature next year, was widely viewed once the new maps were drawn as a prospective challenger to LaMalfa, a rice farmer from Oroville who has represented the North State in Congress since 2013. 
LaMalfa’s current district stretches from Siskiyou County and much of the Oregon-California border down through rural Shasta and Sutter Counties. Under the new voter-approved Prop. 50 maps, the district shifts south out of Modoc County and jogs westward to pick up parts of Sonoma County and McGuire’s home base of Santa Rosa. 
McGuire will face heavy skepticism from some northern rural residents in the 1st Congressional District, who just a few years ago tried to secede from liberal California to form the conservative “state of Jefferson” with rural parts of southern Oregon. 
In an apparent effort to head off inevitable accusations of being out of touch with rural life, McGuire spent much of his launch video doubling down on promises to prioritize farmers’ needs and “make sure rural communities get their fair share.” 
“I know these roads. I know these towns,” McGuire says as he strolls down a tree-lined country road, a white pickup truck clearly visible in the background. “This district is big, it’s rural, and now more than ever, it needs a fighter.”
After devastating wildfires that wiped out thousands of homes and killed dozens in Sonoma and Napa counties in 2017, McGuire made wildfire prevention his signature issue in the Legislature. Following the Palisades and Eaton fires in January, McGuire ushered through an ambitious 13-bill package that expanded insurance coverage and sped up rebuilding of damaged homes after destructive fires. 
His critics have said McGuire’s singular focus on wildfire issues sometimes clouded his ability to balance and prioritize other policy areas, especially once he ascended to the role of pro tem last February, succeeding the well-regarded former Sen. Toni Atkins and becoming the chief traffic cop for which bills could come to the Senate floor.
McGuire also developed a reputation for holding out on negotiations until he could extract a win for his policy priorities or his constituents: He was the top recipient of budget “earmarks” for local projects back home, funds that he will surely tout as major wins during his campaign. 
During last-minute negotiations on a multi-pronged climate and energy policy deal earlier this fall, Gov. Gavin Newsom had to make an eleventh hour visit to the Capitol to push McGuire and his team onto the same page as him and Assembly leadership. 
McGuire promised in his launch video to deliver “no drama, no BS, no gimmicks” if elected to Congress. And while he mostly shied away from the argument that he would flip a seat from Republican to Democratic control, he did acknowledge that he would push back on the Trump administration. 
“Don’t worry, I will always stand up to the destructive policies of Donald Trump,” he said in the video. “I’m all in — every damn day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 13:57:44.197726

Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina extended the deadline by which a homeless encampment in north Lansing must be cleared by 90 days. The initial deadline had been Friday, and Aquilina noted that there are still 40 to 50 people living on the site. 
“I will shorten it if you clean all this up,” she told the city’s lawyers, referring to the time frame given to clear the area. “Once people are leaving, once you help them, once you house them, as I said last time, you may bulldoze and start cleaning it, making it safe, because I don’t want new people there.”
Aquilina hosts weekly hearings in her courtroom in a civil suit brought by the city of Lansing against JAJ Property LLC, the property owners of a site that has become a large homeless encampment that the city is seeking to clear. Throughout those hearings, Aquilina has repeatedly noted that she wants to ensure that the people currently living in the encampment are given the proper support they need to find a safe place to go. 
“These are human beings, not garbage, and they will not, on my watch, be treated like garbage,” she said in the hearing on Wednesday.
“What about the winter? We’re going to have deaths. We need to have these people in a safe place. We need to move them somewhere,” Aquilina added. “They are unlawfully there. I want by no means anyone to think that I think this is lawful.”
She expressed concerns that the population of the camp might actually be growing, though city lawyers said that the growing number reflected more people being willing to work with city social workers, not new people moving onto the property.  
Aquilina also urged the city’s lawyers to seek assistance from local and state government officials outside of herself — city council members, state legislators and even Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. 
“We have a governor, she listens. We have a Legislature, they don’t always listen,” Aquilina said. “How about the mayor? How about showing up to city council? How about we get more than me?”
The city’s legal team told Aquilina that they are doing everything they can to resolve the issue and are “devoting a significant amount of time and resources to coming up with a solution to this issue.”

New Dashboard shows modest gains,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/11/california-k-12-students/,"Test scores improved, but absenteeism and English learner progress stalled in the latest Dashboard.","In summary
Test scores improved, but absenteeism and English learner progress stalled in the latest Dashboard.


California’s K-12 students showed moderate progress academically last year, with some bright spots but otherwise plateauing after years of post-pandemic improvements, according to the new California School Dashboard released today.
Chronic absenteeism, discipline rates and progress among English learners all remained mostly unchanged, with slight improvements. Academic performance improved, but still lagged behind pre-pandemic levels.
The Dashboard is a user-friendly, color-coded guide for the public to understand schools’ performance. Schools get credit for their students’ scores, but also for how much progress they’ve made — a metric that some have said can be misleading. The Dashboard assigns colors to reflect schools’ performance, with blue being the best and red triggering interventions from the state. Last year was the first year all categories earned a yellow or green, indicating improvement.
“Seeing modest improvements on every Dashboard indicator should encourage us to deepen our investments in every child’s progress,” State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said. “We must not rest until all students’ outcomes represent their brilliance and potential.”
College and career readiness a bright spot
A highlight was college and career readiness, with a record-high number of students graduating last year prepared for college and the job market.
Nearly 52% of last year’s crop of graduating seniors satisfied the requirements to attend a public university in California or completed a 2-to-4-year career pathway. The number was up 3.1% over the previous year, bringing the overall total to its highest level since the state introduced the Dashboard almost a decade ago.
California has been promoting career pathways in high schools for years, providing money and guidance for schools to train students in health care, engineering, environmental science, agriculture and other careers. Typically, students take a sequence of career-themed courses linked to their academic work, often combined with out-of-school internships or classes at local community colleges.
Last year, nearly 27% of students completed a career pathway, up about 1 percentage point from the previous year.
College readiness also improved, but that was partly because the state now includes completion of Advanced Placement courses among its measurements. Last year, 55% of students took at least one AP class.
Record-high graduation rate
The graduation rate also hit its highest level — 88% — since the Dashboard was introduced in 2017, when the rate was about 83%. 

“Today’s Dashboard results show California continuing to make important strides in post-pandemic recovery — we’re getting more students reengaged in the classroom, graduating students in greater numbers, and getting more of them prepared for college and careers,” California State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond said in a statement. 
Slight improvement in absenteeism 
But other Dashboard measurements were lackluster. Chronic absenteeism, for example, which soared to 30% during the pandemic, fell only 1 percentage point last year. After several years of steep declines, the rate all but stalled at just over 19%. Before the pandemic, about 11% of students were chronically absent, which means they missed 10% or more of the school year.
The Los Angeles wildfires and a surge in immigration raids are among the reasons for the stalled progress in attendance, said Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a research and policy organization. Thousands of students missed school due to the fires, while others stayed away due to fears of deportation.
“I’m not surprised,” Chang said. “It’s a sign that we need a statewide game plan to address attendance. I also think this will require perseverance over time.”
Schools that prioritized personal relationships with families tended to have better attendance, she said. Attendance also improved at schools that identified individual students who needed assistance getting to school every day and then provided that assistance.
English learner progress was also stagnant, with only 46.4% of students making progress toward English language proficiency. The number increased less than 1% from last year.
Big improvements in Dinuba
Dinuba Unified, a rural district southeast of Fresno, was among the state’s bright spots. The 6,000-student district, where a third of students are English learners and more than 85% are low-income, saw across-the-board improvements last year. English language arts test scores soared more than 10 percentage points, math scores jumped nearly 6 percentage points, and the graduation rate topped 95%.
District administrators attributed the success to low staff turnover and grant funding that allows teachers ample time to prepare lesson plans, collaborate and understand new curriculum, particularly in math. The newly rebuilt high school also has popular career pathways, including construction management and transportation, which entice students to stay in school and graduate, said Lisa Benslay, the district’s director of intervention.
“Our mission is to end generational poverty through education,” Benslay said. “People have really bought into that. They see the need, and feel a moral conviction.”
Funding expires
Statewide, students’ performance tanked during the pandemic, when most schools closed for in-person learning, but rebounded significantly the past few years. The state and federal government poured billions into programs to help students recover, such as tutoring, after-school and summer programs, mental health counseling and enticements meant to boost attendance.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Kirsten Baesler officially resigned Thursday as the federal government reopened, paving the way for her to begin a new job with the U.S. Department of Education.
Baesler’s position leading the state’s public K-12 education system will end Nov. 24, according to a letter of resignation she submitted to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Baesler will become the assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education at the Department of Education after being confirmed by the Senate in October. Her first day was delayed by the federal government shutdown. She has served as the state superintendent since 2013.
“I’m deeply proud of the team we built and the culture we created,” Baesler said in a news release. “We shifted from being a regulatory agency to a customer-service organization that puts students and their families at the center.”
Armstrong appointed Levi Bachmeier, business manager for the West Fargo School District and former policy adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum, as the next superintendent of public instruction. Bachmeier is expected to assume his new duties after Baesler leaves the role.

Baesler highlighted the department’s work ensuring North Dakota students graduate high school “choice ready” for college, a career or military service. Graduates prepared for those three options increased during her tenure, according to the department.
With assistance of state lawmakers, Baesler created an innovation waiver program for schools during her time as superintendent, which empowered local districts to design new teaching and learning models around student mastery of specific subjects of interest.
She also emphasized leveraging student senior years through dual-credit college courses and workforce preparation programs.
“While I am excited to begin this next chapter of service at the U.S. Department of Education, I do so carrying the lessons, values, and steadfast spirit of North Dakota with me,” Baesler wrote in her resignation letter. “I remain committed to ensuring a seamless handoff to my successor and stand ready to assist in any way that helps maintain continuity for the important work underway.”

(Courtesy NMDOH)The New Mexico Department of Health on Thursday issued an alert over ByHeart whole nutrition infant formula, telling the public to stop using it immediately.
ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula’s manufacturers are removing their product from store shelves in New Mexico and nationwide after it was linked to 15 cases of infant botulism in 12 states. Currently, New Mexico does not have any confirmed cases, a DOH news release said.
According to the Centers for Disease and Prevention, infant botulism occurs when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum spores that grow in the gut and make toxin.
Signs of botulism in infants can take a few weeks to develop, health officials said, and include: constipation; poor feeding; drooping eyelids and sluggish pupils; weak sucking; weak or altered crying; lethargy; a “floppy” appearance; and difficulty breathing
Once symptoms start, however, botulism “can quickly become a medical emergency,” Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “Any infant with signs of botulism should be evaluated by a medical professional immediately.”
Untreated, botulism’s symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and torso and subsequent death.
NMDOH says anyone whose infant has botulism should seek immediate attention; those with non-urgent questions can call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773).
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, all ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula products have been recalled, including all unexpired lots of formula cans and single-serve “anywhere” sticks.  The FDA recommends anyone with ByHeart products should take a photo or record information about the package; keep it somewhere safe and label it not for use as the information might be requested in a child becomes sick; otherwise, throw containers out after 30 days.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/byheart.jpg,,,2025-11-13 12:58:06.695955

Moul’s bill was tucked into the wide-ranging education code bill, one of a handful of proposals signed into law by Gov. Josh Shapiro Wednesday as part of the long-awaited state budget deal.
Some schools reportedly directed spectators and attendees to purchase tickets with credit or debit cards, online-only or through an app. This “disenfranchised” Pennsylvanians without Internet access or credit cards, Moul added.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma County killer Tremane Wood was within minutes of execution when Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Thursday that he had decided to commute his sentence.
Wood, 46, was set to die by lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, but Stitt announced in a press release issued at about the same time that he had granted clemency based upon a recommendation last week by the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board.
Stitt said he commuted Wood’s sentence to life without the possibility of parole.
“This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” Stitt said. 
Wood was sentenced to die for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. 
Wipf was a migrant farm worker from  Montana. Wipf’s friend Arnold Kleinsasser was also a target, but escaped.
The Pardon and Parole Board last week voted 3-2 to recommend clemency to Stitt. 
Wood’s attorneys said his brother Zjaiton “Jake” Wood, admitted to the killing. 
Jake Wood received life without parole for his role and died in prison in 2019.
Wood’s attorneys said his trial lawyer, who died in 2018, was ineffective.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office said Wood was the killer and continued his criminal and gang behavior while behind bars.
Wood made a personal appearance by video and took responsibility for his role, but said he was not a killer.
“I pray for the family of Ronnie Wipf and for the surviving victim, Arnie,” Stitt said. “They are models of Christian forgiveness and love.”
Drummond said he was disappointed Stitt granted clemency for a dangerous murderer, but respected that it was Stitt’s decision to make.
“We are profoundly grateful for the moral courage and leadership Governor Stitt has shown in granting mercy to Tremane,” said Amanda Bass Castro-Alves, an attorney for Wood. “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace.”
Stitt last granted clemency in 2021 to Oklahoma County killer Julius Jones. He has denied clemency recommendations in four other cases.

“It’s not fair,” said Meredith Farrow, owner of hemp business Clean Remedies in Avon.
As the federal government shutdown came to an end, hemp sellers like Farrow were surprised by the Senate. When voting to open the government, policymakers closed a loophole created in the 2018 Farm Bill, which allowed for low-level THC products to be sold without regulation.
Congress pushes hemp crackdown after pressure from states, marijuana industry

Congress’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) allowed for hemp products to be sold as long as they have .3% THC or less.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on their website that under the law, the Drug Enforcement Administration no longer has the authority to seize and criminalize sending or buying seeds with less than .3% THC.
In 2019, Ohio legalized the product, as well.
“It would put all my employees out of business and me out of business — and our hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, thousands and thousands of customers that rely on this daily, they would be in a lurch,” Farrow said.
Just last month, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a temporary ban on hemp that gets users high. The products can look like candy, and they’re sold at places like gas stations and smoke shops with no age limits.
But a judge temporarily blocked DeWine’s executive order.
“If I kind of knew, I could make a decision and pivot,” Farrow said. “But being in limbo is the worst place to be,”
State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, has been leading the charge to protect hemp products, and he said Congress threw a wrench in his plans.
“We’re still trying to figure out how to implement what’s going on at the federal level, so I think that maybe pumped the brakes a little bit — while we try to figure out how to proceed based on that,” Fischer said.
But marijuana industry legal expert Jonathan Adler explained that the federal policy doesn’t have to impact Ohio sellers.
Hemp policy will likely be dealt with on a state level, like marijuana, he said.
“While marijuana is illegal for purposes of federal law, the federal government doesn’t have the resources, doesn’t have the personnel to go after individual retailers, individual buyers, let alone individual users,” Adler said.
Adrienne Robbins with the Ohio Cannabis Coalition supports legal marijuana, but is anti-hemp.
She said that the ban should be enforced in Ohio.
“We think this is an issue of public health for both adults and children, to be clear, when it comes to these unregulated products,” Robbins said.
But if we aren’t enforcing federal law with marijuana, we asked Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, if the state should be enforcing it with hemp
“It’s a good question, in fact, a couple of people asked that today,” Huffman responded. “Well, we can do whatever we want regarding hemp… Now, are we going to go around and start cuffing 17-year-old clerks at gas stations? No, but we’ve got to get this thing in shape.”
Huffman has never been a fan of the product or of cannabis, but he said he has lost this fight — and it needs to be regulated in some way.
“I think that THC products should be sold the same way like we do with all alcohol products now… I think [a federal ban] changes the discussion that we’re having now, because with the federal action, there’s no legal way that these folks can operate where they are right now.”
Still, he acknowledged that THC drinks are very popular and likely will continue to be allowed regardless.

Until recently, the site was a state prison.","In summary
Immigrants in California’s newest ICE detention center allege they’re experiencing inhumane conditions and that they’re not getting access to lawyers. Until recently, the site was a state prison.


Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers. 
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves. 
The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic. 
“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges. 
ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there. 
A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.
In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them. 
CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”
The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law. 
“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm  Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP. 
Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections. 
Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list. 
One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice. 
“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-13 16:50:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Fairfield County providers team up to add talk therapy to pediatric practices,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/fairfield-county-pediatrics-offices-psychotherapy-partnership/,A mental health provider is embedding therapists at Pediatric Healthcare Associates' offices to make behavioral health care easier to access.,"A major Connecticut pediatric practice is partnering with a nonprofit mental health provider to bring talk therapists directly into doctors’ offices — an effort to make behavioral health care easier to access amid rising demand for services and a shortage of providers.
With four locations in Fairfield County, Pediatric Healthcare Associates, or PHA, is one of the largest pediatric providers in the state, caring for roughly 34,000 children and young adults. For years, the group has been trying to streamline access to mental health services for its patients, many of whom struggle to find providers who are in-network and accepting clients, CEO Andrea Hagani said. 
“Taking care of their mental health is really important. Just as important as their physical health. Sometimes more,” Hagani said. “We’ve been looking to embed our own mental health services in the practice for years and years and years.”
Last year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that the country’s children were experiencing a mental health crisis. In Connecticut, nearly 1 in 2 teens will experience a mental health condition during their lifetime, according to a report from Fairfield County’s Community Foundation.
But accessing care can be difficult. In Connecticut, roughly 40% of people live in areas with mental health workforce shortages, according to a report from the state’s Office of Health Strategy. Those shortages tend to be more acute for people covered under Medicaid, which is typically accepted by fewer providers.
PHA had tried hiring mental health providers directly, and also looked into partnering with hospitals to bring in specialists, but they had failed to find an arrangement that stuck.
Then, during a chance conversation at an event in June, Hagani was describing the challenge to Edith Boyle, CEO of LifeBridge Community Services, a Bridgeport nonprofit behavioral health organization.
Boyle suggested placing LifeBridge therapists in PHA’s offices. And thus, the partnership was born.
Within four months — thanks to some efficient work from the operational teams at both organizations — one LifeBridge therapist was stationed in PHA’s Stratford office. Today, there are two. 
The plan is to expand the program next to PHA’s Fairfield location and then, eventually, to its offices in Trumbull and Shelton. 
The arrangement allows PHA patients to avoid the cumbersome process of finding a therapist that both has availability and accepts their insurance. Plus, Hagani said, when PHA patients see a LifeBridge therapist, they know they’re meeting with a provider their pediatrician trusts. 
Boyle, LifeBridge’s CEO, said the partnership is also about meeting families where they are, which allows them to address mental health issues before they escalate.
“By embedding behavioral health clinicians within pediatric practices, we meet families in a place of trust and familiarity. It’s about integration, prevention and early intervention, addressing concerns before they become a crisis,” Boyle said during a launch event for the partnership last month. 
In the pilot’s first 30 days, LifeBridge received 70 referrals from PHA pediatricians. As of the end of October, therapists were already providing care to more than 20 kids, Boyle said.
The partnership makes a lot of sense for LifeBridge, as well. Typically, patients at outpatient behavioral health programs miss roughly a third of their appointments. But not a single PHA referral has missed an appointment with a LifeBridge clinician so far.
“My patients are thrilled,” Hagani said, particularly when they find out that LifeBridge accepts most forms of insurance, including Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut. Roughly a third of PHA patients and 77% of LifeBridge patients are covered through HUSKY. 
Howard Sovronsky, the state’s inaugural Behavioral Health Advocate, said Connecticut should be proud to have one of the most robust systems of mental health care in the country. Still, he noted, access issues persist. 
Partnerships like the one between PHA and LifeBridge are a step in the right direction towards more integrated care, Sovronsky said during a press conference last month.
Pediatricians are often the first resource families tap when their children face a mental health issue, but they not often equipped to provide the full range of behavioral support patients may need, he added.
“It’s my hope and belief that this effort will serve as a model to encourage and inspire others to pursue these forms of collaborative care,” Sovronsky said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BRIDGEPORT-MENTAL-HEALTH-1024-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359

Reporters Jenna Carlesso, Dave Altimari, Katy Golvala and Andrew Brown were awarded for “Priced Out,” an investigation into the rate hikes that have affected nearly 100,000 long-term care insurance policy holders in Connecticut. Judges said the piece was “incredibly well done” and noted that it covered an issue with national relevance, saying “everyone in the country is going to have this problem.”
[Read the story here: CT long-term care insurance costs are skyrocketing, strangling consumers]
CT Mirror’s story explored the costs of maintaining long-term care insurance policies, which are skyrocketing due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Policyholders’ rate increases have often exceeded 50% and, for a few dozen people, got as high as 174%, CT Mirror found.
Following the reporting, Connecticut lawmakers raised at least 16 proposals during the 2025 legislative session to reform long-term care insurance. One bill, which would have boosted transparency by requiring insurers to hold public hearings whenever they raise rates by more than 10%, passed the Senate unanimously but died in the House.
“This series reflects what The Connecticut Mirror does best — deep, persistent reporting that holds power to account and centers the voices of those most affected,” CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton said. “We’re proud of our team’s commitment to uncovering the truth about an industry that has long operated in the shadows, and we’re honored to see that work recognized.”
This is the second time CT Mirror has won in the small/regional outlet category since the award’s inception in 2023. That year, Altimari and Carlesso won for “Connecticut’s Elder Care Reckoning,” a four-part series examining Connecticut’s destabilized nursing home sector and a home care system that operates with little to no oversight.
This year’s large outlet category award was given to Nathan O’Neal and Casey Hooker of FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul, who also covered long-term care insurance. They investigated Minnesota insurance companies CNA and Transamerica, finding that the former had increased its premiums by nearly 350% and the latter had a pattern of “delay and deny” in its claims process.

Víctor Ávila aún recuerda los gritos de sus vecinos, y ladridos de sus perros que lo despertaron una mañana a finales de octubre, al ver el humo saliendo de su calentador.
En cuestión de segundos, agarró a sus dos perros bajo el brazo, las llaves de su coche, se puso unas botas y bajó corriendo las escaleras, sin saber que estaba a punto de perder el lugar que llamó hogar durante más de 25 años.
El incendio en el sótano del edificio 271 en la avenida Wethersfield, provocó la evacuación de 17 adultos y siete niños, según la Cruz Roja Americana. Este fue el tercer incendio en octubre que dejó a inquilinos sin hogar y varias viviendas afectadas alrededor de Hartford.
“Llevamos tres años luchando para que se hagan responsables de solucionar todos los problemas y presten más atención a estos apartamentos, no es justo”, dijo Ávila, que trabaja instalando pisos.

El día del incendio, Ávila había regresado de un turno de noche, como la mayoría de los inquilinos del edificio en la zona de Barry Square, que tienen largas jornadas laborales o más de un empleo.
El desastre no fue un caso aislado en Hartford, donde se han producido 83 incendios de viviendas entre enero y octubre de este año, según Mario Oquendo Jr., jefe de distrito del Departamento de Bomberos de Hartford.
Justo al lado del edificio de Wethersfield hay una casa en ruinas por un incendio que ocurrió en enero, y a la vuelta de la esquina, otra casa quemada por un incendio en el verano, donde murieron cuatro personas.
En los días posteriores al incendio de octubre, los inquilinos del 271 no pudieron regresar a sus apartamentos de inmediato y reclamar sus pertenencias, que tuvieron que dejar atrás al evacuar.
Ávila esperaba que sus fotos y cassettes de videos, de los cuales algunos trajo consigo desde Aguascalientes, México, al mudarse a Estados Unidos, siguieran allí y no fueran robadas si alguien entraba a la fuerza en el edificio incendiado y cerrado.

Solicitudes de servicio
Los inquilinos de los edificios multifamiliares 267 y 271 de la avenida Wethersfield, junto con Teresa Quintana, activista de equidad de vivienda por la organización Make the Road, se han organizado para luchar por mejores condiciones de vivienda en los últimos tres años.
“Todos los martes nos reuníamos en uno de esos garajes de atrás y empezábamos la reunión, hablando y diciendo: ‘Esto está pasando’ y ‘Queremos que esto cambie’”, recuerda Quintana.
“Luego enviaban cartas al propietario y se quejaban como grupo ante el ayuntamiento una y otra vez”.
Quintana asegura que cuando inicialmente organizó a los inquilinos para que enviaran quejas a la ciudad sobre cucarachas, ratas y goteras en el techo, los formularios estaban en inglés y la mayoría de los inquilinos sólo hablaba español. “Antes no había quejas porque el formulario ni siquiera estaba en español. Si no hay accesibilidad lingüística, obviamente la gente podría haber empezado a quejarse más”, dijo.
Los inquilinos se manifestaron en diciembre 2023, enero 2024 y febrero 2025. Cada vez, exigieron al alcalde que responsabilizara al propietario por las condiciones de vida peligrosas y la falta de servicios básicos como la recolección de basura, la calefacción y el agua caliente. La última manifestación tuvo lugar el 3 de noviembre, exigiendo justicia por el incendio. 
Ávila, uno de los inquilinos que lleva viviendo más tiempo en el edificio, asegura que las condiciones de vida empeoraron después de que el dueño de siempre vendiera la propiedad a Alpha Capital Funds y, posteriormente, a All is Good LLC. La empresa administradora de los apartamentos era Arlington Group LLC, y ahora es Mint Management Group LLC.
En total, las propiedades 267 y 271 en la avenida Wethersfield han presentado 31 solicitudes de servicio al ayuntamiento por problemas de mantenimiento, tanto ‘urgentes’ como ‘no urgentes’. Estas incluyen fallas en la calefacción y la caldera, goteras en el techo que congelan las escaleras durante el invierno y reparaciones de puertas y ventanas.
Mint Management Group LLC afirma haber respondido a las solicitudes de mantenimiento.
“Tuvimos problemas de mantenimiento y los solucionamos; enviamos a nuestros trabajadores”, respondió un representante de la empresa. “Lamentamos mucho lo sucedido a nuestros inquilinos”.

Los registros públicos de Hartford muestran que la propiedad está legalmente a nombre de All is Good LLC. Sin embargo, la empresa administradora es Mint Management Group LLC, cuya solicitud de licencia de alquiler está incompleta. El arrendador legal directo es Israel Wiznitzer, quien también tiene una solicitud de licencia de alquiler incompleta en Hartford.
Wiznitzer no respondió para comentar al respecto.
Cristian Corza-Godinez, portavoz de la ciudad de Hartford, explicó que una solicitud se considera “completa” únicamente cuando se presenta el formulario de solicitud, junto con el pago de la tarifa correspondiente para la licencia. Si no se paga la tarifa, la solicitud se considera “incompleta”, lo que significa que no se ha tramitado. 
Las solicitudes de licencia de alquiler se gestionan a través del sistema en línea de la ciudad. Se notifica al propietario que debe pagar la tarifa, como se hizo en el caso del dueño de la propiedad 267 en la avenida Wethersfield por tres ocasiones. El siguiente paso es la notificación de una infracción por no completar la licencia de alquiler.
Sarah White, abogada del Centro de Vivienda Justa de Connecticut, dijo que las multas se imponen sobre el edificio como un gravamen y que este puede tener prioridad sobre las hipotecas. Incluso, la ciudad podría intentar ejecutar la hipoteca para cobrar las multas.
“La ciudad de Hartford seguirá utilizando todos los recursos a su alcance para responsabilizar a los propietarios problemáticos por sus acciones u omisiones”, declaró Corza-Godinez en un comunicado. “Altos funcionarios municipales han mantenido conversaciones continuas con los propietarios del edificio afectado, y el enlace municipal para inquilinos de la ciudad de Hartford ha estado presente en el lugar, dialogando directamente con los inquilinos para brindarles el apoyo necesario. En una ciudad donde tantas familias alquilan sus viviendas, el alcalde Arulampalam y su administración seguirán presionando a todos los propietarios para que cumplan con su obligación de proporcionar una vivienda adecuada a nuestros residentes”.
Los propietarios que no han completado la solicitud han recibido avisos de infracción para todos los edificios con 10 o más unidades. Si tienen solicitudes incompletas recibirán un aviso de infracción antes del 30 de noviembre, según informó el portavoz de la ciudad.
“‘¿Están esperando a que nuestro edificio se incendie?’ me dijeron los inquilinos el año pasado, porque llevamos años quejándonos de la forma en que están manteniendo este edificio, y sucedió, se incendió”, dijo Quintana.

Consecuencias
Tras el incendio, el edificio fue asegurado y catalogado como inseguro. Se les indicó a los inquilinos que no entraran, ya que se consideraría allanamiento. Sin embargo, ese fin de semana se produjeron robos, según la vecina Tangela Perry, quien llamó a la policía para reportarlos.
Se les permitió a los inquilinos recuperar sus pertenencias el 5 de noviembre, seis días después del incendio. La empresa que administra el edificio consiguió un contratista, quien prefirió no revelar su nombre, para abrir el inmueble cuyas entradas estaban selladas con tablones de madera.
Cuando los inquilinos comenzaron a entrar a sus apartamentos, se dieron cuenta de que no estaban muchas de las pertenencias valiosas de sus familias. Habían saqueado sus hogares.
“Todo eso se perdió y es irremplazable”, dijo el inquilino Ronald Bozeman, refiriéndose a las joyas de sus padres.

Cuando llegó la policía, los residentes denunciaron la pérdida y el robo de sus pertenencias. “Antes no tenía hogar. Solía ​​dormir en sofás ajenos. Trabajé muchísimo para llegar hasta aquí. Y a nadie le importa”, dijo el inquilino Ryan Pirre.
Quienes no tenían hijos expresaban sus emociones en voz alta, gritando o llorando al ver sus cuartos saqueados, con algunas paredes quemadas o destruidas por bomberos. Quienes sí los tenían, contuvieron lágrimas y empacaron mientras vecinos vigilaban a sus hijos e hijas que jugaban frente a los apartamentos.
Ávila permanecía en silencio mientras su hija le ayudaba a empacar ropa. Sus cassettes de video aún estaban en un cajón, y un sobre amarillo con fotos familiares yacía sobre su cama. “Quería llorar, sentía ese dolor por dentro, pero no me salían las lágrimas”, dijo.
Se les indicó a los inquilinos que recogieran sus pertenencias desde el miércoles 5 de noviembre hasta el viernes 7 de noviembre. El viernes, Ávila vio a los contratistas demoliendo partes del edificio, mientras los inquilinos aún estaban sacando sus pertenencias.
Mint Management LLC no respondió cuando se le solicitó un comentario al respecto.

Desplazados
Pirre lleva menos de seis meses viviendo en el 271 de la avenida Wethersfield. Ha pasado noches de insomnio tras el incendio, alojándose en un motel con su novia y sus tres gatos.
Gracias a la Ley de Asistencia para la Reubicación, Pirre, al igual que el resto de los desplazados, tiene derecho a recibir beneficios de reubicación por parte de la ciudad. Estos beneficios incluyen alojamiento de emergencia, como el motel en el que Pirre se alojó durante dos semanas, alojamiento temporal, almacenamiento de pertenencias, pago de gastos de mudanza y hasta 4,000 dólares para un nuevo apartamento.
Los recursos de la ciudad alivian preocupaciones inmediatas de los inquilinos en cuanto a la vivienda, pero el trauma persiste. “Me desperté de una pesadilla en la que el motel en el que me encontraba se estaba incendiando y tenía que volver a salvar a mis gatos, que tenía que sacar a mi novia de allí”, dijo Pirre.

Días después del incendio, Pirre estaba dando un paseo por Broad Street durante su descanso para almorzar cuando, en pleno día, revivió el trauma. “En ese mismo instante había otro incendio, e inmediatamente tuve un recuerdo muy intenso de aquel momento: el olor a madera quemada, la sensación de asfixia, el escozor en los ojos y la idea de que iba a morir. Tuve que cerrar los ojos, tuve que concentrarme solo en mi respiración”, recuerda.
Ávila cuenta que la noche del incendio no pudo dormir por un dolor en el pecho y cree que fue por haber inhalado humo. No consideró ir al hospital para que lo revisaran, había pedido un permiso sin goce de sueldo en su trabajo y solo podía pensar en resolver su situación de vivienda. “Estaba completamente abrumado, pensando: ‘He perdido mi casa y mis recuerdos’, así que pensé que el dolor de pecho desaparecería, y gracias a Dios, así fue”, dijo.

Quintana y Make the Road, junto con el Centro de Vivienda Justa de Connecticut, se reúnen regularmente con los inquilinos para dar seguimiento a su recuperación y garantizar que se respeten sus derechos.
Ávila recibió el aviso del ayuntamiento de que puede alojarse en un hotel por el momento y recibió 4,000 dólares de ayuda para conseguir un nuevo apartamento, pero dice que no es suficiente.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Board of Regents has tabled a vote on proposed bylaws for the University of Iowa Center for Intellectual Freedom after board members expressed concerns about just who would have control of the center’s advisory committee.
Developed by interim center director Luciano de Castro, the drafted bylaws would establish executive and scholar committees within the center’s advisory council to handle different academic and advisory duties.

While the board’s governance, finance and human resources committee gave initial approval for the bylaws Wednesday, regents suggested changing policies relating to eligibility requirements for committee membership, specifically that a certain number of people on each committee must be currently or formerly tenured at an R1 research institution.
Echoing concerns she shared when the center’s advisory board was first brought to the board of regents, Regent Nancy Dunkel said Wednesday she was concerned about out-of-state control of the center if Iowans are barred from committees due to not having tenure.
Regent Robert Cramer said during the board’s Thursday meeting that the bylaws still need some work.
“I do think we want to get those right, and we want to have them right not just for us right now, but for 10, 20, 30 years from now,” Cramer said.
As the center advisory council will hold its first meeting Nov. 18, Regent Christine Hensley suggested tabling approval of the bylaws until the council has time to discuss them, and then “determine next steps” from there.
The vote to delay the bylaws vote was unanimous.
“It has been a long process, and we have had a lot of input from various individuals, but I agree with the comment that it’s important that we get them exactly right,” Hensley said.

That’s according to a new analysis of water samples collected this summer across dozens of locations in New York and Connecticut, including 10 spots in Greenwich.
The samples showed elevated levels of fecal-indicator bacteria, like E.coli and Enterococcus.
While those bacteria often show up in higher concentrations following heavy rainfall, elevated levels of these bacteria are less likely to be seen on dry days.
But Save the Sound, an environmental advocacy organization that collected the water samples this summer, found elevated levels in several Greenwich locations even on dry days.
That’s unusual and could point to a bigger problem, said Peter Linderoth, the organization’s director of healthy waters and lands.
“If we have high levels of pathogen indicator bacteria during dry weather, there’s a strong likelihood that there might be an issue with the sanitary sewer infrastructure underground,” Linderoth said.
Greenwich has separate pipes that carry sewage and stormwater, but the pipes are often close together, Linderoth said.
“During dry weather, if you have cracks in the sanitary sewer pipes and there’s cracks in the old stormwater pipes too and they’re close by, the water can ooze out of the sanitary sewer pipes and can make its way into the storm sewer pipes and then just discharge freely into local water bodies,” Linderoth said, adding that leaking septic tanks could also be a factor.
In a statement, a representative from Greenwich’s Department of Public Works said several factors could be contributing to higher levels of bacteria, including “animal waste from both pets and wild animals, failing septic systems, or problems with individual sewer connections that are not under the Town’s responsibilities.”
The city said it will investigate reports of elevated bacteria levels, to determine the cause and that it will work to fix the problem or notify responsible parties.
5 Greenwich locations fail Connecticut’s safe swimming standard 
Of the 10 sites tested in Greenwich, Save the Sound said four met Connecticut’s safe swimming standards, including Byram River at Cliffdale Road, Indian Harbor Yacht Club, Mianus River and Greenwich Cove.
Six sites were not deemed safe to swim in, including East Branch Byram River, Pemberwick Creek, Horseneck Brook, Byram Park, Byram River at Comley Avenue, and Bryan River at South Water Street.
Although people don’t often swim in rivers and creeks, Lineroth said it’s important they meet standards set by the Clean Water Act, a federal law that regulates pollutants in water.
“Some of the waters we sample aren’t swimming beaches, of course, but we’re still evaluating them against that swimming criteria,” Linderoth said.
Interacting with contaminated water can cause a range of side effects, Linderoth said, including rashes, pink eye, gastrointestinal issues and wheezing.
The results will be sent to Greenwich’s First Selectman Fred Camillo and representatives from the Department of Public Works. A representative from Fred Camillo’s did not immediately respond for comment.

Tracey Mann, the 1st District congressman from Kansas, says he was glad to cast his vote to end the federal government shutdown and draw to a close the Democrats' ""temper tantrum"" about the budget. This September 2024 image is of Mann preparing for a candidate forum. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. House delegation from Kansas split along partisan lines Wednesday on the appropriations legislation drawing to a close the longest federal government shutdown in the nation’s history.
Republican U.S. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Tracey Mann and Ron Estes voted with the 222-209 majority on the shutdown’s 43rd day to approve the measure. The lone opponent from Kansas was Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids. On Monday, the deal cleared the U.S. Senate on a 60-40 vote with backing from U.S. Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran, both Kansas Republicans.
The resolution signed by President Donald Trump funded the government until Jan. 30, 2026.
“This long, unnecessary, and harmful federal government shutdown is finally about to end,” said Schmidt, of the eastern Kansas 2nd District. “I am hopeful Congress will now use the next two months to proceed under the regular order of finalizing full-year funding for the remaining government agencies and programs. No more hostage-taking. No more demands for backroom deals. Just line-by-line scrutiny of the federal budget.”
Senate Democrats for about six weeks withheld support for the closure-ending package in an attempt to secure extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits due to expire Jan. 1. In the end, Democrats settled for a December vote on the issue in the Senate.
Davids, who serves the Kansas City metropolitan area, said she declined to endorse the deal because U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, refused to commit to a House vote on extending subsidies tied to ACA health care premiums.
“I’ve said for weeks that we’ve got to come together and find a bipartisan compromise to open the government again,” she said. “But this can’t be at the expense of threatening health care for the more than 160,000 Kansans who rely on ACA credits to afford care and the thousands more who will see skyrocketing health care premiums.”
Davids said ending the shutdown meant federal employees would be back at work and receiving paychecks, but the fight to bring down the cost of health care wasn’t over.
“Kansans are sick of the political gamesmanship in Washington while people in Kansas pay the price,” she said.
Mann, serving a district covering much of rural Kansas as well as Lawrence, said he “proudly voted to bring this shutdown to an end once and for all.”
“The hardworking men and women who are the backbone of our country should not have their lives upended in exchange for Democrats’ pandering to their leftist base,” Mann said. “For 43 days, Washington Democrats have kept the federal government closed as they threw a temper tantrum and demanded that Congress adopt radical policy proposals like taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants.”
Mann repeated the claim also made by Trump that Democrats wanted to fund health care to people without the documentation to legally be in the United States. In fact, Democrats had sought repeal of a federal law denying Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program coverage to people who were “lawfully present” in the United States. That would benefit lawful permanent residents, refugees, parolees and individuals granted asylum, but not anyone in the country illegally.
Estes, who represents a district centered on Wichita, voted for the funding bill. He blamed Senate Democrats for holding the government hostage and demanding the GOP “give in to their radical political agenda.”
“Congressional Republicans are ready to enact President Trump’s priorities and continue delivering wins for Kansans and the American people,” Estes said.
The House approved a budget resolution in September that could have prevented the shutdown, but the Senate failed more than a dozen times to pass it.
Moran said he was relieved the Senate came around to a bipartisan short-term government funding patch and a set of appropriations bills for defense and agriculture. He said work on the federal budget was far from complete, and the new deadline loomed.
“Congress must work diligently to pass the remaining appropriations bills before the end of January to prevent another useless and unnecessary shutdown,” he said. “I’m committed to working with my colleagues to address the concerns they have, and any issues brought forth by the shutdown.”
He said shutdowns were damaging to the economy and highlighted dysfunction in Washington, D.C. The chaos also demonstrated for U.S. adversaries “we can’t work together to meet even the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress,” he said.
Marshall said the nation ought to salute the handful of Senate Democrats who represented “true courage” for siding with GOP members. He continued to denounce Senate Democrats who voted to hold the government hostage for political leverage.
“Now that the political games are over, I look forward to getting back to work and continuing to deliver on the America First agenda,” Marshall said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tracey-Mann-with-tie-choke-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359

(Photo by Getty Images)Xcel Energy wants to place dozens of high-voltage batteries at commercial sites across Minnesota over the next few years. Each would have 1 to 3 megawatts of capacity, enough to power hundreds of Minnesota homes with wind and solar power — even when the sky is dark and the air is still. 
Made possible by plummeting battery costs and rapid technology improvements, the proposal is significant for Xcel and Minnesota’s power grid, which state law requires to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2040. It’s part of a broader strategy by Xcel and other Minnesota utilities to expand grid-connected battery capacity from next to nothing in 2020 to hundreds of megawatts in 2030.   
As it scales to an initial capacity of 50 to 200 megawatts in 2028, Xcel’s distributed battery network will form a utility-controlled “virtual power plant” that soaks up power during periods of low demand and injects it back into the grid when it’s needed most. In the program’s first two of four phases, Xcel — not the site hosts — would own and operate the batteries, as it plans to do with larger-scale battery installations expected to come online later this decade.
Xcel says the first-of-its-kind distributed battery program, called Capacity*Connect, will keep the power grid reliable, support Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate and meet rising electricity demand without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. It could also indirectly reduce customers’ power bills by shifting Xcel’s energy purchases from higher- to lower-cost periods.
Utility watchdogs and clean power proponents say they support those goals. 
But they question whether a program that Xcel estimates could cost as much as $430 million over three years is a good use of ratepayer dollars, pointing to Xcel’s own calculations showing its quantifiable benefits falling modestly short of the expected costs. In a filing last month with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, Xcel asked regulators for permission to recover eligible program costs from customers, as it routinely does for other infrastructure projects.
Colorado got a better deal
A settlement between Xcel’s Colorado subsidiary and that state’s public utility commission earlier this year would see it administer a 125-megawatt virtual power plant program there for less than one-third the cost per megawatt of a 200-megawatt Minnesota network. 
The Colorado program allows energy resources other than batteries to participate, including smart thermostats, water heaters and EV chargers. While those resources don’t directly store electricity like batteries do, they can still reduce grid stress by shifting power demand away from peak periods. (In last month’s filing, Xcel said its Colorado cost calculations were specific to that state and “not directly applicable to Minnesota.”)
Clean power groups also note the early phases for which Xcel has provided the most detail are far less ambitious than the more than 800 megawatts of solar and battery capacity the utility envisioned in an initial filing in 2024. They favor a more competitive, faster-to-scale framework that invites non-utility partners into the mix and leverages Minnesota’s existing residential and community-scale solar arrays — something closer in spirit to Xcel’s Colorado program or a Minnesota alternative sketched out in a DFL-backed bill legislators may consider next year.
“The easiest way to stand up a program like this is to go back to existing solar customers and try to sell them on batteries,” said Shannon Anderson, distributed power plant policy director at Solar United Neighbors, in an interview. 
In its Minnesota filing last month, Xcel didn’t outright disagree. It did, however, say it needed to move deliberately to ensure that Capacity*Connect delivers on its promise while laying the technical groundwork for a more open and sophisticated distributed energy network that could take shape in Minnesota in the early 2030s. 
In the meantime, Xcel offers an upfront incentive for customers who want batteries for backup power. It’s worth $175 per kilowatt-hour on systems up to 50 kilowatt-hours, up to a maximum incentive of $5,000. That helps ease the bite of installing a home battery system, which typically costs more upfront — though less over a 20-year service life — than a diesel or gas generator. For non-Xcel customers, the Minnesota Department of Commerce pays $250 per kilowatt-hour or $7,000 total. Both programs offer higher incentives to low- and moderate-income customers.
Early next year, Xcel plans to launch a second program, Minnesota Battery Connect, that would pay residential and commercial battery owners to enroll small “behind-the-meter” systems in a separate, utility-operated virtual power plant. Xcel has yet to disclose payment amounts or limits for that program but said in an Oct. 31 filing that it would follow a successful Colorado initiative that has enrolled nearly 2,500 battery systems with incentive payments of $350 per kilowatt-hour. 
In front of v. behind the meter
Xcel says it will pay commercial customers enrolled in Capacity*Connect, too, though the public filing obscures the proposed amounts behind trade-secret redactions. But because the batteries will sit in front of the customers’ utility meters, they will be fully controlled by Xcel, which means those payments may be the only direct benefit they see. Customers with behind-the-meter batteries can more easily use them for backup power and to store energy generated by onsite solar panels, reducing their net energy costs. 
Xcel’s October filing acknowledged those behind-the-meter upsides but said the Capacity*Connect front-of-the-meter approach would more efficiently achieve system-wide reliability and cost benefits. 
In an email last month, Xcel spokesperson Theo Keith said the utility views distributed batteries “as any other investment we would make on our electricity grid” and said Capacity*Connect would reduce power constraints at key locations, allowing it to defer more expensive grid upgrades.
Keith also noted that Xcel separately works with “large customers” looking to install backup power systems at their facilities. 
Legislators look to mandate virtual power plant program
Outside groups — and representatives of publicly traded companies that stand to benefit from a more open, competitive battery network — say Minnesota can have its cake and eat it too. They point to success stories like California’s Demand Side Grid Support program, which in three years added 700 megawatts of capacity — enough to power more than 500,000 typical homes — managed by aggregators like Sunrun and Tesla Energy. In a two-hour event on a sweltering July evening, the network discharged 539 megawatts, nearly matching the output of the Monticello nuclear plant in central Minnesota.
“Instead of increasing costs through slow, unproven and untested programs, we hope Minnesota leaders will look to replicate the successes of distributed power plant programs to quickly, affordably meet the critical needs facing us here in the Midwest,” said Amy Heart, Sunrun’s Milwaukee-based senior vice president of policy.
A bill introduced in April by DFL Reps. Larry Kraft of St. Louis Park and Kari Rehrauer of Coon Rapids could help move things along. 
Beginning in 2026, it would require Xcel and other Minnesota electric utilities to propose a virtual power plant program that would reduce peak winter and summer electric loads by 10% or more within three years. Unlike the first phases of Capacity*Connect, the Kraft-Rehrauer bill would allow outside aggregators like Sunrun to operate energy assets in the program — though utilities themselves could also serve as aggregators.
Kraft said in an interview he was working to build bipartisan support for the bill and “hopefully get it passed in some fashion this session.” He framed it as a “yes, and” complement to the utility’s proposal, rather than an either-or alternative, and said he was heartened to see Xcel embracing grid batteries on a meaningful scale.
“More energy storage on the grid can have a hugely positive impact in terms of adding renewables and saving money for people…I would like to see a thriving market where we are unlocking the complete value of all of that,” Kraft said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1241219865.jpg,,,2025-11-13 10:58:32.026521

U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper in his 41-page ruling dismissed McIver’s claims that she is the victim of selective prosecution and that most of the charges she faces are barred by legislative immunity. Prosecutors allege McIver assaulted federal agents on May 9 at a migrant jail in Newark as the agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. 
“Impeding an arrest, whether lawful or unlawful, goes beyond any reasonable definition of oversight and, accordingly, exceeds the safe harbor of legislative immunity,” Semper wrote.
It’s unclear when McIver’s trial will begin (it had been scheduled to start Monday but Semper delayed it pending Thursday’s ruling). Semper said he needs more facts to decide on McIver’s motion to dismiss the third charge she faces.
McIver has pleaded not guilty and maintained the charges are political retaliation for her unannounced inspection of the jail.
Her attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Missouri exceeds the national average for revenue earned by veteran-owned businesses as well as the prevalence of these businesses.


A business is considered veteran-owned if a military veteran owns 51% or more of its stock or equity.


Luke Dietterle, University of Missouri Extension specialist, released a report in October detailing the state of veterans in Missouri’s economy. It showed veteran-owned firms generate 2.3% of the state’s business revenue, which is above the national average of 1.8%


“The veterans in Missouri that are business owners tend to punch above their weight a little bit,” Dietterle said.


Although Oklahoma, Arkansas and Nebraska have higher densities of veteran-owned businesses, Missouri’s businesses generate higher shares of the state’s total revenue.


Veterans make significant contributions in several counties’ local economies. Sales attributed to veteran-owned businesses in Reynolds, Iron and Dent counties account for more than a quarter of the overall sales in those places.

Veterans are most represented in the arts, entertainment and recreation, with 8% of Missouri firms in this sector being veteran-owned. Wholesale trade follows close behind with 7% of firms.


The share of industry revenue generated by veteran-owned firms was highest in mining, quarry and oil and gas extraction, at 22%. Transportation and warehousing followed, with 13% of revenue attributable to veteran-owned firms.


Despite the success many veterans find in business, they still face significant barriers in the transition to civilian life.


“You’re not really going to have a credit history,” Dietterle said. “You’re not really going to have sufficient income to serve as collateral for a loan. These folks are just leaving the service, and they just haven’t had those experiences. They haven’t been able to build that record of financial responsibility.”

“We encourage the residents of Dearborn to ignore this act of provocation,” said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Michigan Chapter. “It appears as if this individual, who’s an outsider of our community in southeastern Michigan, is trying to use Muslims as a political football to get publicity.”
This is not the first time Hudson, a Genesee County truck driver who also ran for Congress in 2024, has targeted Dearborn, the nation’s largest Arab-majority city, in his campaign — in an October debate, he said that as governor he would authorize the National Guard to go into the city, again citing “Sharia law.” 
He further wrote on X that he was asking the National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps to be present at the march, in the same post that he said that the march will be peaceful. 
“This gentleman is coming to provoke a response,” Walid said. “Let him come in and holler to the wind and the sky, and have him go about his business.”
Cpl. Dan Bartok, a spokesperson for the Dearborn Police Department, wrote in a statement, “The Dearborn Police Department is aware of a planned rally inside the city this month. We are in contact with organizers, as is the case for many free speech events in Dearborn, and anticipate, and are fully prepared for, a peaceful and safe event.”

FRONTLINE, PBS’s investigative documentary series produced at GBH in Boston, has selected VTDigger for a yearlong reporting partnership to examine the aftermath of Vermont’s severe flooding and the federal government’s shifting response to natural disasters.
Emma Cotton, who has served as VTDigger’s environmental reporter before becoming a senior editor, will lead the project’s reporting. Her work, as part of FRONTLINE’s Local Journalism Initiative, will investigate how this extreme weather has affected our residents, housing situation, farms, businesses and landscape.
“Our goal will be to investigate why some Vermont communities are struggling to recover from the floods and how they could be better supported in getting back on their feet,” said Geeta Anand, VTDigger’s editor-in-chief. “We will do this in conversation with people in these communities so that our reporting is deeply informed by those most affected by the floods.” 
VTDigger is one of seven newsrooms selected for FRONTLINE’s Journalism Initiative. Digger will team up with Blue Ridge Public Radio and The Texas Newsroom (the collaboration among NPR stations in the state), providing in-depth coverage of the impact and recovery efforts as we grapple with worsening weather and increased destruction.
“I’m so grateful to have FRONTLINE’s support, which enables us to dedicate a new level of resources to one of the most important stories in the state,” Cotton said. “I look forward to giving this story my complete attention over the next year, and I’m eager to connect with Vermonters across the state to understand how flooding has affected them and their communities.”
Vermont, long cast as a climate haven, is struggling to recover from back-to-back major flooding events, never mind prepare for the next ones. For each of the past three years, extreme flooding has taken place on the same day, July 10.
Small, rural towns, like those in southern Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom, have tiny, sometimes volunteer governments with limited capacity to plan for floods. Some of these towns are currently grappling with millions of dollars in debt — doubling their annual budgets in some instances.
“So many of us were personally affected by these floods — my road washed out two years in a row, and my former Montpelier business was destroyed in 2023,” said Sky Barsch, VTDigger’s CEO. “I know firsthand how vital it is to have deep, sustained reporting on what recovery entails. Under Geeta Anand’s leadership and with Emma Cotton’s excellent reporting, VTDigger is proud to partner with FRONTLINE to bring these stories to light.”

(Getty Images)West Virginia’s food stamp recipients will have their full November benefits on their cards either today or first thing Friday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Thursday. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, helps feed about 275,000 — or one in six — West Virginia residents. Benefits for November have been delayed since Nov. 1 because of the federal government shutdown.
Morrisey’s announcement comes after Congress approved legislation reopening the federal government, ending the longest federal government shutdown in United States history. Trump signed the bill into law Wednesday evening. 
During the delay, the state of West Virginia contributed about $13 million to food banks in the state as the state’s charitable food network saw an increased demand. Morrisey also activated the West Virginia National Guard to assist in food distribution and other efforts. 
“We’ve been involved helping every West Virginian in need of it to make sure no one goes hungry,” Morrisey said. “We had a system where no one goes hungry. That matters in West Virginia. I want to thank everyone involved for the successful effort over the last 13 days.”
Morrisey made the announcement while speaking at the Governor’s Energy Summit in Charleston.

Homicide rates among pregnant women increase with the rate of firearm ownership, according to a new study. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Homicide rates among pregnant women increase with the rate of firearm ownership, according to a state-by-state study published this week in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.
Researchers found the firearm homicide rate for pregnant women was 37% higher than the rate for nonpregnant women. Suspected perpetrators were most often male for both pregnant and nonpregnant women.
The study builds on previous research showing that women are more likely to be killed when they are pregnant: Homicide is a leading cause of maternal death, with firearms involved in a majority of killings, according to previous research.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital analyzed data from 7,063 recorded homicides of women between 2018 and 2021 across 37 states.
Of those homicides, 434 victims were pregnant women. Black women made up a majority — 250 — of pregnant homicide victims, and about 78% of pregnant women were killed by a person using a firearm.
The team’s statistical analysis also found that for every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership, there was a 6% increase in all-cause homicides in pregnant women and an 8% increase in firearm-homicide rates in pregnant women.
Domestic violence in Native communities is focus of new survey

Louisiana had the highest rate of all-cause homicides in pregnant women. It also had the highest rate of killings in which a firearm was used, at 111 per one million live births, followed by Missouri, Alaska, West Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina.
“It is such an awful phenomenon that’s occurring in this country,” said Maeve Wallace, an epidemiologist and associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona. Wallace’s research has shown homicide to be a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death.
Wallace, who wasn’t involved in the new study, said it points to how lax firearm policies put women at risk.
“There’s been a real failure to address it at multiple levels, including in maternity care, in communities and addressing the ability for people to thrive and be safe and healthy,” she said.
Because there is insufficient data on state-level firearm ownership, the authors of this study and other researchers use “proxy” measures to estimate those figures, such as extrapolating from statistics on suicides by firearm.
Police officers can help prevent domestic violence killings by asking the right questions

Liz Tobin-Tyler, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health who studies intimate partner violence, said pregnancy is “the most vulnerable time for intimate partner violence and homicide.”
The study “highlights the disproportionate risk of firearm-related homicide for Black women during pregnancy,” she said, “an often overlooked contributor to disparities in maternal mortality.”
She added that the fact that researchers only had information from 37 states points to the need for better state data collection and reporting on violence against women.
“With the cuts to federal agencies, like the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], this data will likely be even more difficult to obtain,” Tobin-Tyler said. “We cannot act on these problems if we do not document them.”

(Photo courtesy of Leslie Rubin/WCHS)A miner missing in a flooded West Virginia coal mine was found dead Thursday morning, according to Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The governor released the name of the miner, Steve Lipscomb, who had worked as a foreman at Alpha Metallurgical Resources’ Rolling Thunder mine in Nicholas County.
“Governor Patrick Morrisey and First Lady Denise Morrisey were heartbroken to learn of this tragic loss and are keeping Mr. Lipscomb’s family, friends, and fellow workers in their prayers. Today, we grieve for this terrible tragedy and honor the life of one of our own,” Morrisey posted on his X account.
A mining crew hit an unknown pocket of water Nov. 8 about three-quarters of a mile into the Rolling Thunder mine, resulting in the flood. All other miners working on the site were accounted for. Nicholas County Commissioner Garrett Cole posted on Facebook that Lipscomb had “worked to ensure that everyone on his crew was getting out of the mine.”
Crews have been working for days to lower water levels inside the Rolling Thunder Mine so they could search for Lipscomb. Morrisey told reporters that he had called on national experts, including the National Cave Rescue Commission, to help with the complicated rescue due to the level of water in the mine.
“Crews had worked tirelessly around the clock in 12-hour shifts in a search for their colleague. Each shift included roughly 15 workers underground, 8 on the surface coordinating and loading supplies, and another 8 staging and fusing a new waterline,” Morrisey posted.
Crew were able to enter this mine this morning after water levels had lowered sufficiently for a safe entry. 
“Over the past several days, crews have worked around the clock with courage, skill, and determination, doing everything humanly possible to bring their colleague home. Their commitment and teamwork reflect the very best of West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Nov. 12, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday took comment on a series of bills centered on the application process for concealed pistol licenses, including a proposal to lower the age requirement. 
Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell), whose House Bill 4586 would lower the age to apply for a concealed carry permits from 21 to 18, argued that at 18 years old, Michigan residents are able to vote, pay taxes, and enlist in the military, and should thus be trusted with the same right to self defense granted to other law-abiding citizens. 
“Right now, Michigan tells us that an 18-year-old soldier or Marine that are mature enough to deploy overseas and carry a service weapon for our country, but somehow, is not responsible enough to carry a sidearm to protect themselves in their own neighborhood.” Woolford said. “This doesn’t make sense to me.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When presenting the bill to the committee, Woolford stressed that the policy would not touch any of the safeguards in the law around concealed pistol licensing – including background checks, training requirements, and disqualifying offenses – it merely lowers the age limit. 
He also noted that under the existing law, 18-year-olds can purchase a handgun from a private individual, though they must be 21 to purchase a gun from a federally licensed dealer. 
Brady Schickinger, the executive director for the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners, further argued that Woolford’s bill would make the state law more uniform, as 18-year-olds are already legally permitted to purchase and own a firearm and to open carry a pistol. The committee’s chair, Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), noted that her sons are able to take the safety training class for a concealed pistol license, they can’t actually get their license until they’re 21. 
However, the bill was not without criticism, with both Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety taking a position against the bill. 
Gail Duncan of Charlotte told the committee that she’d joined Moms Demand Action after her daughter was killed at work, with the gunman later taking his own life.
She noted that firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens and warned that individuals 18 to 20 commit homicide with guns at three times the rate of adults 21 and older. 
“The area of the brain responsible for judgment and impulse control is not fully developed in 18, 19 and 20 year olds, meaning that they can be more prone to aggressive behavior,” Duncan noted, calling on committee members to oppose the policy.

The committee also heard testimony on bills focused on how these licenses are issued. 
Rep. Pat Outman’s (R-Six Lakes) House Bill 5113 creates a grace period to correct errors on their application for a concealed pistol license if their initial application is disqualified due to either an applicant or administrative error, while Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4980 reintroduced a policy first brought by former state Rep. Gary Eisen (R-St. Clair Township) during his tenure in the House.
The policy would allow individuals to apply for a concealed pistol license in any county, whereas currently they are currently required to submit their application to the county clerk in their county of residence, or directly to Michigan State Police, who forward it to the appropriate clerk. 
The bill had received bipartisan support when it was first introduced, with Eisen explaining that the legislation came from his work as a concealed pistol license instructor, with some students reporting monthslong waiting periods, while others were able to receive their license on the next day, if not the same day.
While Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) raised concerns about how the bill would be implemented, asking whether county clerks used the same system in processing these applications, Maddock noted that every county has a mechanism and procedure in place to review these applications, and that the counties whose delays could stem from a large number of applications also receive more revenue from the fees in order to process them.

“In my opinion, there’s no excuse for Wayne County or Washtenaw County to have a long waiting period, because they’re getting that additional revenue,” Maddock said. 
While the committee did not vote on any of the bills up for testimony, they did approve House Bill 4284, which would reduce the fee for renewing a concealed pistol license from $115 to $30. While $36 of the current renewal fee is forwarded to county treasurers for deposit into their concealed pistol licensing fund, all $30 of the new fee would go toward the fund.
The panel voted 7-2 along party lines to refer the policy to the House floor for further action, after shooting down a proposed amendment from Rep. Tyron Carter (D-Detroit). Carter and Rep. Helena Scott (D-Detroit) voted in opposition to the policy.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Immigrants who have recently been held at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center say that conditions at the facility, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in rural Evangeline Parish, have deteriorated as more and more people have been held there over the past year.
In interviews, a man detained at Pine Prairie through June and a legal consultant for another man held there this summer described a crowded facility with scarce resources — men sleeping on floors due to an alleged lack of beds inside packed dormitories; detainees wearing the same uniforms for several days because they weren’t given a change of clothing (not even underwear), pleading with staff for hygiene products to keep themselves clean and denied access to medical care and other services.
“These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life,” said Alexandra Smolyar, an attorney at Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice who consulted with the man detained at Pine Prairie over the Summer.
Pine Prairie, which is run by the private prison corporation the GEO Group, has a contract with ICE that calls for a maximum daily population of 500. But it has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees since as early as mid-April, according to information from data research organization Transactional Records Access Clearing House at Syracuse University, or TRAC. While ICE reported that Pine Prairie had an average daily population of 788 on Sept. 15, the most recent date for which a count is available, TRAC researchers have calculated the average population at that time at 915 people.
Since President Trump was sworn in for his second term — promising an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants, no matter whether they have criminal records or are considered dangerous — the number of people being held in immigration detention has skyrocketed by 69%, from just over 39,000 in December to about 66,000 today.

Complaints from immigrant rights advocates about poor conditions inside detention centers are not uncommon. In 2020 and 2021, federal oversight bodies received several complaints from advocates about lack of hygiene products and personal protective equipment inside Louisiana’s immigration detention facilities, including Pine Prairie, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As that detained population has grown in 2025, media reports and advocates have described cramped quarters where living conditions have gone from bad under the Biden Administration, to much worse under Trump.
Advocates told Verite News that Pine Prairie is a case in point. They said capacity issues are leading to worsening conditions at the facility, which already had a long history of complaints alleging human rights abuses and civil rights violations.
“This year it feels much worse,” said Tania Wolf, an advocacy manager at the National Immigration Project, who has gone on frequent visits to ICE detention centers in Louisiana. “It feels like things are getting to a point where things are gonna boil over in terms of conditions.”
A ‘horrible pressure point’
Lenin, a Honduran citizen who was detained at Pine Prairie from October 2024 until he was deported in June, said in an interview last week that conditions at the facility were poor during the entirety of his stay. Lenin, who said he fled his birth country in 2015 after MS-13 gang members allegedly killed a close relative and threatened to kill him, asked Verite News to publish only his middle name because he fears for his safety since he has returned to Honduras.
Lenin said when he first arrived at Pine Prairie he was placed in a crowded dorm where some men slept on the floor. He said that he and other detainees had been given only one pair of underwear and one uniform, leaving them with no way of changing into clean clothes for days. They had difficulty getting hygiene items, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste and at times even toilet paper, Lenin said. The dorm was kept cold and staff would not respond to detainees’ requests to increase the temperature, he alleged, adding that staff often denied him visits to the medical unit to receive medication or treatment for anxiety and depression.
“They don’t treat us like humans,” Lenin said. “If you don’t speak English, you can’t have anything,”
In late July and in early August, attorney Alexandra Smolyar, at the Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sent emails to immigrant rights lawyers who work in Louisiana, including Wolf, alleging “absolutely abysmal” conditions inside Pine Prairie, relayed to her by a detainee with whom she had consulted.
ICE keeps detaining pregnant immigrants — against federal policy

The details laid out in her emails are similar to the conditions that Lenin described — inadequate clothing leading to detainees wearing the same clothes for days on end, guards shouting and using profanity when speaking to detainees, staff skipping nightly pill calls causing people to miss medications, detainees getting the wrong medication.
“Overcrowding is growing more dire by the day; medical care is severely lacking; there’s no access to a law library or mail,” she wrote in an August email. “The conditions are really harrowing.”
In a September interview, Smolyar said the Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, who has since been deported, described to her a packed intake area for people initially booked into the facility with one shower, one toilet and one sink and detainees sleeping on bare mattresses set on the floor of a holding cell. (Smolyar declined to identify the former Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, but she said he was deported in August.)
“It epitomized how the expansion of detention is coming to this horrible, horrible pressure point where people’s lives are in jeopardy every day,” Smolyar said.
Wolf said she had already become concerned about overcrowding at Pine Prairie in July, when she attended a standard tour of the detention center.
Wolf said she and others on the tour — which was approved by ICE officials — repeatedly asked staff and accompanying ICE agents for a count of detainees booked into the facility that day. In her notes, Wolf wrote that the group was never given a population count. The omission, she said, was very unusual.
When the tour got to the visitation area — a space where detainees often meet with attorneys — Wolf said it looked more run down than in previous visits she’d made to Pine Prairie.
“It just looked a little bit more — for lack of a better term — lived in,” Wolf said.
Wolf said detainees later told her that some of them had been sleeping in the visitation unit due to overcrowding. In a phone interview this week, Wolf said she’d never heard of a facility making detainees sleep in its visitation area before then.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the GEO Group, the company that operates Pine Prairie, denied claims of worsening living conditions at the facility.
“GEO strongly rejects these baseless claims, which are preposterous and bizarre,” wrote GEO Group Director of Corporate Relations Christopher Ferreira. “The Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center provides high quality support services that adhere to ICE’s detention standards and contract requirements, which provide for ample access to pre-scheduled recreation opportunities both indoors and outdoors. Individuals at the Center are in no way deprived of natural light nor are they subjected to excessive artificial light.”
In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Tamara Spicer, did not answer specific questions about conditions at Pine Prairie but said the agency is experiencing “unprecedented operational demands” due to “recent unlawful border crossings.”
“ICE has appropriately intensified enforcement operations to restore integrity to the system,” Spicer said. “The volume of apprehensions is not the result of ICE policy but the direct result of individuals choosing to break the law. ICE will not apologize for enforcing U.S. law.”
Problems with ICE’s population figures
ICE provides bimonthly reports with “snapshots” of the total number of detainees in its custody in each state and overall. But, for individual facilities, the agency only reports the average daily population — pooling numbers from the start of the fiscal year (October 1) through the present day. The result is a skewed perception of how many people are detained at a facility at any given time.
In April, ICE reported that Pine Prairie detained an average of 689 people — though ICE records show the population reached as high as 923 on April 13, a number obtained by TRAC through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Data researchers have responded to the lack of consistent data on daily population counts by creating a new method to calculate the average daily populations that they say provides more accurate results for how many people are currently (or have recently been) detained at a facility. To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.
Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities. According to the site, on Sept. 2, Pine Prairie’s interval daily population was 1,010 detainees, more than double its contractual capacity and 233 people and more than ICE’s reported average population for the same day of 783 people.

Overcrowding in ICE facilities began making headlines in March, when images and video from inside Krome detention center in Miami showed detainees sleeping on floors with cardboard boxes for makeshift mattresses.
According to data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by researchers at TRAC, nearly half of all ICE facilities in the country were housing more detainees than their contracts with ICE allowed as early as April.
That data showed two other Louisiana facilities, Richwood Correctional Center and Winn Correctional Center, run by private prison company LaSalle Corrections, were operating over their contractual capacities by several dozen detainees.
LaSalle Corrections did not respond to emailed requests for comment on its facilities’ operating over capacity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Backed up
Wolf said that on the tour at Pine Prairie, staff referred to the detention center as an “overflow” facility for ICE’s staging facility in Alexandria that sits on the tarmac of an international airport that is the Department of Homeland Security’s main deportation hub. Considered the final stop for many migrants before they are removed from the U.S., the staging facility is supposed to hold detainees for 72-hours or less, while ICE prepares for their deportation flights. However, in September, the Guardian reported that many detainees are being held at Alexandria for longer than three days.
“For the system to work … the people who are going to be funneled into the staging facility need to be somewhere else in the weeks preceding,” said Norah Ahmed, legal director at ACLU of Louisiana.
According to Ahmed, Pine Prairie appears to be operating as a pre-staging facility — holding detainees with orders of deportation who may have exhausted their options for legal ways to remain in the country while their deportation flights are being prepared. She said when flights don’t take off as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances, such as negotiation breakdowns between the U.S. and countries accepting deportees, sometimes people get returned to Pine Prairie after it has already accepted new residents to take their place, contributing to overcrowding.
Lenin spent roughly nine months at Pine Prairie. As the facility was growing more crowded, Lenin said, he was in solitary confinement. He said staff told him it was for his own safety after a confrontation with other detainees. He said he told staff members that isolation, inside a small room with no windows to the outside world and where the hallway lights were kept on continuously, might exacerbate his anxiety and depression. But he remained in segregation, he said until his deportation in June.
Smolyar, who works mainly with people detained in Georgia, said she fears that, in the months since the detainee she was consulting with at Pine Prairie was deported, things have gotten worse.
“We’re seeing incredibly high numbers of people being detained. They’re being pushed to a breaking point,” Smolyar said. “These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life.”

(Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Kan. — A Kansas City, Kansas-based international nonprofit is leading people from 17 developing countries out of poverty through individualized projects. 
Unbound’s approach is to empower the people it serves to identify needs and make funding decisions. 
“Traditionally how that’s done is by designing programs at a global level, a top-down sort of method,” said Becky Findley, Unbound’s vice president of program development. “But at Unbound we really try to listen to families and hear what their needs are and respond to that. That way it’s more of a bottom-up approach.”
Monica Gomez has spent more than two decades at Unbound, where she now serves as a program director overseeing Latin America. Gomez, who spoke to Kansas Reflector through a translator, said a successful example of bottom-up aid is the Agents of Change program — where community members identify a need, draft a plan to address it, and submit it to Unbound. The approved proposals are showcased online, where donors can choose to fund them directly.
The proposals aren’t always funded entirely by Unbound. They often hinge on partnerships with local governments — for permits or funding. Unbound’s role, as Gomez describes it, is in part to provide funding and in part to equip community members with the skills to secure those resources themselves.
“This program comes to let the families and communities identify their own problems and find grants that they can use to solve those problems,” Gomez said. “I think that every proposal that comes from this program shows the heart of Unbound. Our heart tells us to listen, accompany, and walk with the families that we serve, and when the communities see themselves as (agents of change), they trust and they start making the change.”
In Honduras, Gomez visited an Agents of Change project where community members had built a dedicated shelter at the cemetery for mourners to say goodbye. Gomez said Unbound gave $500 to the project.
“With much pride they shared with me about having this place with a roof and walls, a dignified place for them to say goodbye,” Gomez said. “This took them to different authorities to get permissions, to get grants from the government, and this made them feel really empowered.”
Malou Navio is an Unbound program director who has overseen Agents of Change projects in Asia and Africa. She helped put street lighting in rural areas, build bridges across rivers for easier access to food, put latrines in schools, and build wells.
“The Innovation (Fund) we call macro projects. Medium to macro,” Navio said. “Agents of Change are our micro projects.”
The Innovation Fund is a new program that allocates $500,000 to support new projects proposed by Unbound participants. From the 23 submissions, a council of Unbound participants selected 12 initiatives to receive funding ranging from $20,000 to $60,000.

Findley, Unbound’s vice president of program development, said the fund “is a way to create larger programs that target larger populations, larger communities, larger needs that go beyond the individual or the family, that still allows people who would benefit from the program to be in control of the resources.”
In Tamil Nadu, India, $21,000 went to a project aimed at getting 300 working mothers formal credentials. The mothers were identified by social workers.
“Their skills are high end,” Navio said. “Only, they have no formal credentials to point to, so they are underpaid. They are now working with the universities to certify their skills, their experience and their expertise.”
After the funds were received in July, the past three months have been spent identifying the strengths and needs of each mother and preparing their leave from work.
In Guatemala, $60,000 went to a project aimed at providing clean water to 600 families. The project has already installed 1.5 kilometers of water lines, and once the infrastructure is installed families will be paying for their own water service.
“It’s important to mention that the total cost of this project is three times more than what Unbound has given to the families,” Gomez said. “This is why families have been given labor as their way of promoting this, also carrying out different activities to generate more income — to take this project to a happy ending.”
Donors decide where their money goes in Unbound — to the Agents of Change grants, Scholarship Program, Critical Needs Fund, Global Classmates, Birthday Fund, or the Christmas Fund. They can also make a general donation, which is used to pay for things like the Innovation Fund.
“Right now we don’t really get too much grant funding,”  Findley said. “That’s something that we’re dipping our toes into, but with the closure of USAID, primarily it’s a lot of individuals which I think is another cool aspect.”
The U.S. Agency for International Development distributed food and aid around the world for six decades until the Trump administration closed the agency and canceled most of its programs earlier this year.
Donors to Unbound also can directly sponsor a child or elder through a monthly donation program, which Findley said has been sustainable.
A large part of the individual donors are Catholic. The organization was founded in 1981 by two Catholic missionaries and spent the 1980s and 1990s funding other Catholic missionaries.
“But then in the early 2000s we shifted to having our own standalone programs,” Findley said. “What we see now is that it was the foundation of faith that really established the values of the organization, but we don’t choose participants based on religion.”
Unbound’s 2024 annual report shows more than $130 million in public support. The report says more than $112 million went to direct support of programs.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Becky-Unbound-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-11-13 09:57:45.963523

The state has made significant progress over the past decade in making it easier for motorists to afford to purchase an electric vehicle and install chargers in homes. 
But Massachusetts has yet to tap funding from a key federal program to install chargers throughout the state’s network of major highways, the state’s Department of Transportation confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon.  
And now, the implosion of a major contract the state awarded to redevelop 18 service plazas along the Massachusetts Turnpike is bound to push back the installation of even more EV chargers. 
“All these things together make it harder to achieve our deployment goals,” said Eric Bourassa, director of transportation at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and a member of the state’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Coordinating Council. 
Those delays underscore the challenges facing the state in cutting pollution from the transportation sector, which accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts at 37 percent. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles is a crucial part of those efforts, but the state remains far off its goals for the chargers needed to both increase consumer confidence in the technology and power the vehicles once they are on the road.  
There were 9,413 publicly accessible charging ports in Massachusetts as of May, the fourth-highest rate per capita in the country, but the state would need to triple its annual rate of new charging deployments through 2030 to achieve its climate commitments, according to the most recent state data. 
The latest blow to the state’s EV charging efforts is the byproduct of a larger debacle around the state Department of Transportation’s attempts to refurbish the turnpike service plazas. The winning bidder, Irish company Applegreen, backed out during final negotiations — and with it went the nearly 800 EV chargers it pledged to install over the course of the 35-year contract, dozens of which were set to be deployed next year.  
It’s not clear how many charging stations will ultimately be called for at the service plazas as the state starts from scratch and launches its rebid of the process. The original request the state released last year tied much of the charging installation requirements to studies on future demand, which remains murky, especially after Massachusetts paused its EV sales requirements for manufacturers earlier this year. 
The new bid has not yet been released, and the state transportation department declined to comment on when it might be or what it may include, citing active litigation involving the department and Global Partners, the Massachusetts-based company that sued the department after it lost the original bid to Applegreen.  
Global Partners didn’t comment on the specifics of the EV charging plans it laid out in its original bid beyond saying that it remains “committed” to reapplying in the next bidding process and that expanding EV charging is part of its “bold plan” for the plazas. 
The transportation department is “balancing multiple goals” with a complicated contract like this one, said Bourassa, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council transportation specialist. “These are the hardest procurements to do in state government. You’re trying to accomplish 10 different goals. You want this awesome new plaza that’s going to have great amenities for motorists and new facilities and new restaurants. You want electric vehicle charging. You want revenue. You’re trying to get that balance.” 
The two companies involved in the turnpike service plaza dispute, ironically, are a central part of the state’s strategy to install chargers along Massachusetts highways through a different initiative, where the state has been slow to act.  
Massachusetts has yet to deploy any EV chargers through the $64 million in federal money the state was awarded as part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, the transportation department confirmed, despite a five-year goal to install at least 92 charging ports through NEVI funding. Nearby states like Rhode Island and New York, on the other hand, have moved ahead faster in building out the charging stations under the federal program.  
The state selected Applegreen, Global Partners, and a third company, Weston & Sampson, as developers under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Those companies are proposing charging sites to the Department of Transportation, which have not yet been approved, the department said. 
“This has had a lot to do with the way we went about procuring contractors and professionals,” said Jim Aloisi, a former state transportation secretary who now lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and serves on the board of the advocacy group TransitMatters. “Procurement is something that is kind of boring from a public perspective. But it’s almost always a barrier to moving quickly. I don’t think Massachusetts did anything to expedite it.” 
But even as Massachusetts officials are still figuring out how to supply the necessary chargers on highways to ease “range anxiety” — the worry of EV drivers about whether they’ll make it to their destination, or the next charging station — the state and local communities are sifting through the complicated challenges of deploying chargers on town streets and parking lots and connecting them to the electrical grid. 
Aloisi said since most driving is local, he wants the state to dedicate more money to municipalities in order to accelerate deployment of chargers, and in the metro Boston area, to install them at commuter rail station parking lots — to get people out of their cars in the first place. 
“It’s great that we have the federal money to deploy NEVI in Massachusetts, but that’s not going to solve anywhere close to our needs,” he said. “We could be providing more direct funding to cities and towns. They know their streetscape. They know where the right spots are. We’d be much better off doing that as a way to encourage more and more people to even consider the transition to EVs.” 
Massachusetts has advanced a number of policies to boost the uptake of EVs over the last decade. The Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program funds charging infrastructure, the state has expanded a rebate for EV purchases, and the electric utility companies have launched programs to install EV chargers at homes, workplaces, and publicly accessible areas. 
Plus, Beacon Hill enacted a “right to charge” rule last year to make it easier for residents of multi-family buildings to have charging infrastructure at their condo or apartment complex.   
With those policies in place, there’s a “real desire to get this right,” Bourassa said. “Sometimes that means it takes longer, because we have gotten it wrong in the past,” he said, pointing to past instances of broken highway chargers on the turnpike.  
Still, with looming emissions reduction mandates and a squeeze on additional help coming from Washington, time is of the essence. 
“Any delay is bad,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, regarding the stalled service plaza chargers and slow-moving NEVI plans. “There’s no way to sugarcoat that. We need to triple the pace of deployment between now and the end of the decade to build enough EV charging stations to meet our climate requirements. So any delay has ramifications on that front.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Electric-Chargers-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 09:57:45.963523

As Kristen Moreland waited for the livestream to buffer, her thoughts drifted to the years she’d devoted to defending Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the northeastern sweep of Alaska where the mountains give way to the coastal plain. On screen, the chatter of aides stilled as men in dark suits gathered behind a lectern. Then Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced plans to open the area, roughly the size of South Carolina, to drilling.
It marked another round in the decades-long tug-of-war over developing one of the country’s largest remaining protected areas — an effort that came to a head during President Donald Trump’s first term, and ground to a halt when President Joe Biden took office. Burgum also restored seven oil and gas leases that a state-funded corporation bid on during the final days of the first Trump administration, and that his successor later revoked.
Moreland, a Gwich’in leader and executive director of the tribal committee dedicated to protecting the Nation’s sacred coastal plain, sat stunned as the YouTube stream continued. The place she grew up — where generations have lived on the tundra alongside the caribou, weaving their history into the land — had been reduced to a line item on someone’s balance sheet. When Burgum said opening the refuge would benefit northern communities, “it felt like a slap in the face,” she said.
“They’ve never reached out to us to listen to how this would affect our livelihood,” she said. Moreland fears development will drive the herd that the Gwich’in rely on out of range and contaminate rivers in a region where hunting and fishing are a matter of survival. For her, it felt like erasure. “It’s another disrespectful action from decision-makers,” she said. “It ignores our voice as Gwich’in and violates our rights as Indigenous people.”
As the fight over development in the Arctic continues, federal officials are racing to fulfill Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. Though the government is shut down and many employees are not getting paid, officials continue approving permits for extractive industries. In a wood-paneled Beltway office, Burgum framed his “sweeping package of actions” as a declaration that “Alaska is open for business.”
To that end, the administration also signed permits for the controversial 211-mile Ambler Road to mineral deposits, including one owned by Trilogy Metals — which the Trump administration now holds a 10 percent stake in — and authorized a land exchange that will allow for construction of a road through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, at the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. “I told the president it’s like Christmas every morning,” Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy said. “I wake up, I go to look at what’s under the proverbial Christmas tree to see what’s happening.”
Last week’s announcement may not end up being the gift the governor is hoping for.

The fight over drilling in the refuge began almost as soon as President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the site, once called Arctic National Wildlife Range, in 1960. The most recent volley began in 2017, when Trump signed a tax bill requiring two oil and gas lease sales there within seven years. When the first sale was held in 2021, the state corporation Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA, was the only major bidder. It hoped to keep drilling prospects in the region alive, despite weak industry interest. The sale ultimately generated less than $12 million — a fraction of the nearly $2 billion projected by the Tax Act for the last decade.
The Biden administration later found the leasing program’s environmental review inadequate. It conducted a new analysis, then canceled the leases in 2023, citing “fundamental legal deficiencies” and its failure to “properly quantify” greenhouse gas emissions. The second mandated sale, in early 2025, received no bidders. Compounding the challenge, major banks and insurers have refused to finance or underwrite projects in the refuge, citing environmental risks. Oil majors have also steered clear: In 2022, Chevron and the company that took over BP’s leases on private land within the refuge paid $10 million to walk away from them. That same year, Exxon Mobil told shareholders it has “no plans for exploration or development” there.
Still, this spring Trump issued an executive order calling for the reinstatement of AIDEA’s leases, and a federal court ruled that their cancellation was handled improperly. The state-funded investment firm remains the sole holder of leases in the refuge.
The problem is AIDEA doesn’t have the capital or technical expertise to build out these areas on its own. It has authorized spending nearly $54 million to develop them and move permitting for Ambler Road forward. That includes hiring consultants for seismic testing to map oil and gas deposits. But first it must get permission from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to harass polar bears, something that has sparked viral protests in the past. AIDEA authorized another $50 million for Ambler following Burgum’s announcement.
Ultimately, the state corporation is spending public money on infrastructure that private firms would normally fund, while sidestepping oversight, said Suzanne Bostrom, a senior staff attorney at Trustees for Alaska. The watchdog legal organization accused AIDEA of having redirected money toward refuge leases and Ambler from accounts within its Arctic Infrastructure Development Fund, and later its Revolving Fund, to avoid the need for legislative approval. Randy Ruaro, AIDEA’s executive director, wrote in an email that it was not legally required to seek authorization.
All of that aside, AIDEA’s track record is pretty grim. Financial records suggest the corporation lost at least $38 million on its last oil and gas venture, the Mustang field on the North Slope west of the refuge. After oil prices fell in 2020, the corporation foreclosed on the project. The state provided another $22 million in a 2023 bailout before AIDEA sold the field for an undisclosed sum. Bostrom says AIDEA has “no actual plan for seeing a return” on its spending in the refuge. In fact, the people of Alaska often lose money in its deals; one analysis found that almost half of the agency’s investments have been written off as worthless. The economists who crunched those numbers found the state would have come out about $11 billion ahead if that money had been put to work elsewhere.
In an email, Ruaro called the analysis a “hit piece” and said the corporation has  recorded its best financial performance in six decades over the past two years. He said that analysis “failed to account for the billions of dollars generated in economic benefits” by the Red Dog Mine, which produces lead and zinc in northwest Alaska. The corporation poured $160 million — about one-third of the project’s startup costs — into infrastructure to support the operation. At the same time, AIDEA’s own consultants concluded that the mine would be built regardless, and the investment was unnecessary. “AIDEA loves to point to the Red Dog mine as a shining example of their success,” Bostrom said, but even taking those claims at face-value “doesn’t erase that AIDEA still has no viable financial plan in place to cover the cost of building the Ambler Road.”
Ultimately, any plans for the refuge and Ambler Road — which the Bureau of Land Management has said would harm Indigenous and low-income communities — raise questions about who benefits from such development. AIDEA has, for example, proposed financing the private Ambler road through Gates of the Arctic National Park with bonds repaid by tolls, a plan critics call unrealistic, given the cost could hit $2 billion. “It’s hugely problematic for the state to issue bonds with no viable plan for repayment,” Bostrom said. “That’s not a good investment decision.”
But Ruaro wrote that is only one of several options, and that he is “confident the mines … have billions of dollars in minerals needed by the nation.” He also said AIDEA now estimates the cost at $500 to $850 million, and said the road can be built in phases.
Even with prudent financial strategies, the economics of extraction remain precarious — especially as domestic oil prices dropped below $60 a barrel this summer. Given the average breakeven price of $62, new Arctic production may not be profitable — though it would extend the life of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that carries crude from the North Slope. The U.S. is already the world’s top producer, and more output won’t necessarily lower consumer fuel prices, says Boston University’s Robert K. Kaufmann, because OPEC and other nations still influence global markets. (As to the “energy emergency” that Trump declared, Kaufmann said, “I want what he’s smoking.”) Instead, the leases will bring more production online when “any rational scientist is calling for reducing carbon emissions.
Despite the risks, some communities in the region support new oil and gas projects. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge sits within North Slope Borough, which is larger than 39 states. Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat — a nonprofit funded by the regional Alaska Native Corporation — notes that 95 percent of the borough’s tax revenue comes from the industry, funding things like schools and clinics. Fossil fuel royalties directly benefit Indigenous communities like Kaktovik, funding essential services. “When Uncle Doug [Burgum] calls, I answer,” Josiah Patkotak, the borough’s mayor, said in a statement praising the Interior secretary’s announcement.

It can be difficult to disentangle genuine local support from efforts quietly backed — or directly compensated — by the industry itself. During a legislative hearing earlier this year, state Representative Ashley Carrick said one person who testified as a community advocate was paid by AIDEA, something Ruaro confirmed to her that it routinely does. This can create the impression these projects are widely embraced.
“There’s this wide consensus that [Iñupiat] people all want the oil and gas projects. It’s not true,” said Nauri Simmonds, executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic. Many of those adversely impacted by drilling stay silent for fear of losing work or social standing, she said — and some who have spoken out have faced threats and violence.
Simmonds says what might be lost by developing the refuge can’t be counted in dollars. AIDEA now holds leases in a part of the refuge where the Porcupine caribou herd gathers to bear its young. The Gwich’in name for the region, where cool coastal winds protect the newborns from insects and heat, translates to “the sacred place where life begins.” Beyond its shelter, calves are 19 percent more likely to die. Scientists and Indigenous peoples fear the clamor of development will drive the herd away, severing a bond that has sustained people and animals alike for millenia. Even as climate change reshapes one of the country’s last undisturbed ecosystems, it is political forces that now endanger it most.
“One of the most wounding pieces is that this wouldn’t be something that the companies would have gone after on their own,” Simmonds said. “It is the enticements from Alaska, from the corporations, from the political landscape, that creates the appeal.”

Youth homelessness has declined by nearly a quarter since 2019 in California, according to a new report that offers a bright spot amid the state’s ongoing struggle to bring people off the streets.
Last year’s homeless census counted about 9,900 unhoused Californians under age 24 — a 24% reduction from 2019, according to a report by John Burton Advocates for Youth. The number of young people sleeping on the street (not in a shelter) declined 42%.
That progress hasn’t been universal. Overall homelessness in California increased 24% during that time. Nationwide, youth homelessness increased 11%. 
So why are things getting better for young people in California?
More money, according to the report. Starting in the 2018-19 fiscal year, California launched a new homeless housing and services grant and reserved 5% of those funds for young people. By the 2021-22 fiscal year, the overall grant had reached $1 billion, of which 10% was dedicated to young people.
State funding cuts on the horizon threaten to derail California’s progress. The 2025-26 budget includes no new Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention funding (a cut that won’t be felt until next year, due to the delayed nature of the funding program). Legislators have proposed $500 million for the 2026-27 budget, which would be a 50% cut from last year’s budget.
Jovenes, Inc., which serves homeless young people in Southeast Los Angeles County, relies on that state money to fund its housing subsidy program, according to the report. Traditional homelessness programs tend to prioritize older people with disabilities and chronic illnesses who have lived on the street for a long time, which can make it hard for young people to get a bed. 

Andrea Marchetti, executive director of Jovenes: “That’s 219 slots going away. The bottom line is that there’s already not much out there for (transition-aged youth), and if the funding is not renewed, we’re leaving thousands of young people without support.”

Newsom’s former chief of staff indicted

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff was indicted Wednesday on multiple counts of fraud, allegedly committed during her time working for the governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Dana Williamson, along with three co-conspirators, were indicted as “the result of three years of relentless investigative work,” said FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel, in a statement.
The indictment alleges that from 2022 to 2024, Williamson worked with a Sacramento lobbyist; Sean McCluskie, the former chief of staff to former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra; and two other unnamed co-conspirators to funnel away $225,000 from a dormant Becerra campaign account to McCluskie for personal use.
The indictment also accuses Williamson of claiming more than $1.7 million in false tax returns, which she used to buy luxury handbags, chartered jets and more.
Becerra, who is running for governor in 2026, said Wednesday that he did not know about the scheme and that he is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Newsom’s office is distancing the governor from Williamson.

Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson: “While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”

AT&T continues quest to abandon landlines

With parts of California experiencing frequent mudslides, floods and other natural disasters, the ability to reliably contact emergency services remains vital for residents. But for years AT&T has been trying to retire its copper landline service and bow out of its legal obligation to be the state’s “carrier of last resort,” report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Malena Carollo.
AT&T provides 75% of the state’s last-resort phone service, covering about 500,000 Californians. This year, it poured at least $4.5 million to pass a bill, which ultimately stalled, that would have allowed it to cut its copper services in certain areas of the state in exchange for agreeing to expand its fiber services.
It costs AT&T at least a billion dollars a year to maintain landline service in California, and state and federal subsidies for doing so have waned in recent decades. Still, the company is in the black, with $9.7 billion in reported profits so far this year. 
But critics say landline alternatives have their drawbacks: Fiber optic lines require backup power, and cellphone services aren’t as reliable. They also argue that AT&T wants to line shareholders’ pockets at the expense of communities that rely on landlines during emergencies. More than one million 911 calls in California are made each year over landlines.

Mayor Karen Bass' runs for re-election, will Austin Beutner, former L.A. schools chief, developer Rick Caruso or President Trump be factors?","The announcement by investment banker and former schools chief Austin Beutner that he will challenge Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for re-election poses several questions about the state of politics in America’s second-largest city.
Among them: Is Bass vulnerable to a respectable opponent? If so, what kind of challenger might give her the most trouble? And how, if at all, does the long shadow of President Donald Trump affect the parameters of this race?
Let’s take those in order:
Yes, Bass is vulnerable. Public and private polls place her approval rating somewhere in the low 40s, against a disapproval rating in the high 40s — which means she’s about 10 points under water, a danger zone for an incumbent. 
The good news for her is that her disapproval hasn’t risen above 50% in any poll, so she hasn’t alienated a majority of voters. 
It also bears noting that her standing comes at a time when many political figures are held in low esteem. 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom typically tops 50% since he stepped up his attacks on Trump. The president, for point of reference, is deeply unpopular, with disapprovals outweighing approvals by 18% — shocking even for a leader who generally receives low marks from Americans. 
Bass’ numbers are nowhere near alarming enough to count her out, but they do invite challengers. For months, speculation has mostly centered around businessman Rick Caruso, who Bass beat in 2022. If Caruso gets in, it will set up a rematch of a race in which he spent more than $100 million of his own money, only to lose to Bass by 10 points. 
Private polling has shown Caruso potentially starting off a bit better this time, but not by much. Many voters don’t like that he’s a developer or that he registered as a Democrat just in time to run in 2022.

Even Caruso’s attempts to challenge Bass over her response to the January wildfires were complicated by his record during that devastating event. Caruso’s private fire crews protected his mall in the Palisades while allowing structures around them to burn — not a great look for a would-be mayor for all Angelenos.
Beutner’s main contribution to the campaign so far may be to crowd out Caruso. It’s hard to imagine there’s room in a Los Angeles election for two rich white guys. Indeed, there’s reason to wonder whether there’s even room for one. And with Senator Alex Padilla’s announcement last week that he won’t run for governor, Caruso may have a better opening in that race. 
As the campaign moves forward, a look at the issues and personalities will help voters make up their minds in this race, but for now, the questions are more structural than personal. 
Which brings us to this one: What kind of challenger might pose the biggest threat to Bass?
People outside Los Angeles undoubtedly imagine that a liberal, Black woman mayor would be vulnerable only to a conservative, someone who could hold the center while she drew support from the left. 
Those people would be wrong.
Los Angeles is among the most liberal cities in America. If anything, Bass may be more conservative than the city’s political center. Given that, there’s been talk of possible liberal challengers to her. The popularity of Democratic Socialists in several council districts and New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s recent victory are reminders that the left has a solid and growing hold in America’s urban centers.

For his part, Beutner resists attempts to categorize his candidacy as fitting into one lane or another. In an interview last week he emphasized he is seeking the office in response to what he senses as broad disappointment in Bass’ leadership. 
He’s arguing for an all-out commitment to building more housing, an issue that might put him to Bass’ left. To liberal housing advocates he offers a construction boom and, one hopes, a burst in supply that might bring down rents. 
But he also talks about improving public safety, security and cleanliness, issues that might appeal to more conservative voters.  
That’s going to take some footwork, but Beutner, a former superintendent of Los Angeles public schools, is not to be taken lightly. (Disclosure: I worked as an editorial page editor at the L.A. Times when Beutner was its publisher in 2014-15.)
One recent private poll found just 23% of those interviewed had an impression of Beutner. Coaxed by a description of him as a “Democrat who gets things done” and given a few other tidbits from his resume, they broke in his direction, suggesting a  possible campaign path. However, they did so when fed a positive description of him and his achievements. That’s a favor the Bass campaign will not grant him.
Which brings us to the final question: How is this campaign affected by Trump?
The mayor’s race will appear on the ballot next June and, if no candidate gets a majority in that round, the runoff will be in November. That places it in competition with the Congressional midterms — hotly contested races sure to place Trump in the center of the conversation.
That, too, probably helps Bass, because Trump has made it clear he doesn’t respect the mayor. And the electorate in Los Angeles has made it just as clear that it has no use for him.
Ever since ICE began waging its theatrical and overbearing raids in Los Angeles last summer, Bass has risen to oppose the president, challenging him in court and in public appearances. 
For his part, Trump has called Los Angeles a “trash heap” and disparaged Bass as being “not very competent.” And Stephen Miller, Trump’s architect of the ICE raids, has accused Bass of siding with the “illegal alien invasion” of California. 
In normal times, a mayor might suffer under such withering criticism from Washington. But as much as Trump nationalizes this campaign, he helps Bass; he’s not hurting her. 
The recent vote on Proposition 50 — which authorized redistricting California Congressional seats to counter Texas’ efforts to help Trump in the midterms — shows more than 64% of Californians supporting it.
That’s a big number. But in Los Angeles, the yes vote was 74%, a staggering majority and entirely dedicated to thwarting Trump. As those numbers prove, voters here detest Trump. He has a way of crowding out other conversations. 
If Los Angeles sees Bass as a bulwark against the president, it may be hard for Beutner, or any other candidate, to find traction — especially if they appear on the same ballot voters will use to register unhappiness with a president they loathe.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111225-Karen-Bass-Palisades-TS-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.
While states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high — without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.
That’s led dozens of states (including Connecticut) to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill — which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today — goes too far.
[RELATED: CT House votes to set standards on THC products]
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.
Texas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.
This summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.
Last month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.
Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the attorneys general wrote.
Hemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.
“Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,” he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.
Though it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.
On Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry.
“The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,” the trade group posted online.
Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.
“These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we’ve been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,” he told Stateline.
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.
But fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would “eradicate the hemp industry” and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.
The hemp loophole
Hemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.
But that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
That’s because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.
“With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,” she said. “But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You’re not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.”
Harris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.
But even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.
“There’s a big part of that activity that you can’t control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that’s one thing that they’re asking for is federal leadership on this issue,” she said. “I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.”
If approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.
For example, the change likely won’t dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.
But in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.
On Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.
“The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,” he said.
‘Running with knives’
The hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.
But producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.
“They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that’s somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],” he said.
His organization cheered the Senate’s efforts “to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.”
Lindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.
“To me, that’s like running with knives,” he told Stateline.
The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.
In its “Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,” the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.
Those results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.
“In my mind, if it’s marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,” Mullins said.
He said calling the unregulated products “hemp” is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: “Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.”
Mullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws — including those against trafficking marijuana without a license — that could help address the issue.
Catherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”

AT&T’s failed effort this year to retire copper landlines in parts of California seemed to have support from a diverse grassroots coalition. But many of the members had ties with the telecom giant, CalMatters found.




Upon hearing her husband’s call for help, Cynthia Halliday came flying upstairs. He was rushing toward the outdoor deck, gasping for air. He was having a heart attack.
Halliday held him and dialed 911 with her cellphone. The dispatcher answered, but within seconds, she said, the call disconnected due to poor reception. Halliday screamed for help, loud enough for her next-door neighbor Larry Williams to hear and dial from his copper landline. This time, it got through.
Halliday’s husband did not survive. But on that day in 2018, Halliday became convinced that copper landlines were her best shot at getting help during emergencies, especially where she lives in Hacienda, a tight-knit community deep in the rural forests of Northern California. 
Those landlines, however, are what AT&T — the largest copper landline provider in California — is pushing to retire nationwide. 
As California’s largest “carrier of last resort,” AT&T is required by law to provide basic phone service, typically copper landlines, to any Californian who asks for it, with lower-income customers qualifying for a discount. It provides 75% of the state’s last-resort phone service, accounting for about 500,000 Californians and 5% of all its California customers.
Subsidies to support copper landlines have declined sharply. Critics say AT&T wants to shed them to avoid their billion-dollar annual cost  and boost profits with lucrative services like fiber.
For the past two years, AT&T has tried unsuccessfully to bow out of that obligation in many areas of the state, spending heavily to influence state regulations and laws. This year, it spent at least $4.5 million on lobbying as it tried and failed to pass a bill that would have allowed AT&T to cut copper services in certain areas in exchange for agreeing to expand its fiber services. Its industry ally, USTelecom, assembled a “grassroots” coalition to support the legislation, with more than 80% of coalition members having ties to AT&T, CalMatters found.
The company’s efforts to shed copper landlines show no signs of stopping. An ongoing process by the utilities regulators seeks to determine key components of the carrier of last resort requirements. And Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, an Inglewood Democrat, told CalMatters she intends to revive the bill that died this year.
It’s unclear just how many Californians would be impacted if AT&T gets its way. A map AT&T submitted to California utilities regulators as part of a failed 2023 effort marked 1,133 towns across 53 of California’s counties, including rural communities such as Hacienda, as territories the company sought to withdraw from. 
AT&T said it only wants to pull out of communities with multiple alternatives, such as wireless and fixed broadband. It argued it’s not cost-effective to maintain expensive copper lines for many of its customers, the number of which has dwindled over the years. Doing away with the obligation would free up money to invest in more advanced technologies, such as fiber optics, it said. 
“No Californian will be left without reliable phone service in their homes, including 911 services,” said Terri Baca, vice president of legislative affairs at AT&T, at an April legislative hearing.
But critics say the reliability of those alternatives isn’t guaranteed, and that AT&T’s push would pad shareholders’ pockets at the expense of a lifeline for those communities, especially during power outages and natural disasters. Statewide, more than one million 911 calls are made each year over landlines, according to the state’s Office of Emergency Services. 
If AT&T’s goal is to upgrade services, it should build them out before retiring copper, opponents argue.
“If they wanted to replace copper with fiber right now, there’s nothing stopping them,” said Phil Grosse, a Hacienda resident and the North Coast regional chair of the California Democratic Party’s rural caucus.

The debate has intensified in California in recent years, partly because it is a significant holdout in AT&T’s plan to abandon copper networks across the country.
Spokespeople for USTelecom, its coalition Californians for a Connected Future, and AT&T did not specify how they recruited coalition members or why most members had ties to AT&T. Instead, they sent general statements calling the state’s carrier of last resort obligation archaic.
“Our goal is to deliver the best possible experience to our customers, now and into the future,” said Megan Ketterer of AT&T.
Cara Duckworth, a spokesperson for USTelecom, told CalMatters “even if we answered all the questions I’m not sure we’d get a fair shake.”
“Many of our providers would love to no longer have to spend money maintaining old copper equipment and would much rather invest that money in next (generation) networks that better serve consumers,” she said. 
Some rural Californians say they fear AT&T will eventually wear state lawmakers down to that goal.
“Rural communities don’t have the big money to compete with AT&T. That’s why we hire legislators to look out for us,” Grosse said in a June letter to state lawmakers.
‘Predictably unpredictable’
Kathy Yerger, 67, lives among redwoods so dense that wireless Internet providers have refused to service her Hacienda home. 
“It would be like trying to find a golf ball in the sky,” she remembered one provider telling her. Another, upon learning her address, chuckled and told her “no, you are not on the list,” she said.
Although she has a cellphone, Yerger has learned not to rely on it. 
“If I put the phone in the window and hope the stars line up and the trees don’t blow, yes I can (try to connect),” she said. “It’s predictably unpredictable.”
Like many of her neighbors, Yerger’s best — if not only — bet at communicating with the outside world is her copper landline. Even that line fails sometimes when water corrodes the old copper wires. But it’s still the most reliable option she has, especially during emergencies and natural disasters.

In Hacienda, frequent mudslides and floods during rainy winters have washed away homes, sparked power outages, and sometimes claimed lives. The 2020 Walbridge fire, which scorched more than 55,000 acres of Sonoma County, got within a quarter mile of Yerger’s house. The only notification was word of mouth from the local fire department deputies and a neighbor calling her landline, she said. 
Few reliable alternatives remain during those disasters. Cellphone services, which many Californians rely on to receive emergency alerts, can quickly fail. Fiber optic lines, while more resilient, require backup power along the network and are expensive to install. Voice-over-Internet-Protocol phones, a landline alternative, depend on the internet and home electricity and thus fail during power outages. 
The alternatives are so unreliable during emergencies that Hacienda residents created walking evacuation routes along the area’s ragged switchbacks. They set up their own walkie-talkie network, drilling weekly. They even discussed using bullhorns and sirens to alert each other if a wildfire comes through, Grosse said. The hope is to reach enough people for someone with a copper landline to call for help. 
“There’s no copper fetish here,” Grosse said. “When a reliable alternative appears, I’d really be happy to give (it) up.”
A technology upgrade or a profit grab?
Underlying AT&T’s push to retire copper is money. Telecom companies previously received subsidies from state and federal governments for last-resort services, but those payments have been reduced or eliminated in recent decades. California, for example, reduced its subsidy fund from $400 million in 1996 to about $20 million currently, according to a USTelecom regulatory filing. 
This leaves companies providing landlines with a larger share of the bill for maintaining such networks. For AT&T, that’s about $1 billion each year in California alone.Despite this, AT&T remains profitable. An October filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed a $9.7 billion profit so far this year. And fiber is one of its profit drivers, bringing in $2.2 billion, up nearly 17% from the same time last year.
“They’re looking for a way to boost profits,” said Ernesto Falcon, communications and broadband program manager for the California Public Advocates Office.“They can’t legally do that unless you get rid of (the carrier of last resort requirements).”
AT&T representatives have repeatedly insisted that the company’s efforts to pull out as a carrier of last resort are to modernize telecommunication. In public hearings, they promised that AT&T’s request would not threaten copper landlines in areas without other viable options. 
So far, state regulators and lawmakers aren’t convinced.

The California Public Utilities Commission rejected a March 2023 petition by AT&T that would have allowed it to pull out copper lines only in service areas where customers have telephone service alternatives. The application claimed 99.7% of its customers had access to at least three alternatives, with 99.9% having access to at least two.
After the rejection, the company turned to the state Legislature, sponsoring bills to relinquish its obligation. 
Last year, an AT&T-backed bill would have granted the company relief if it notified the commission of certain census blocks with no customers or with multiple phone service alternatives. The bill, authored by McKinnor, died without a hearing.
McKinnor reintroduced the measure as Assembly Bill 470 this spring. In its final form, the bill would have allowed AT&T to pull copper lines out of open spaces and “well served” areas — those with at least three other service providers — if it promised, among other requirements, to expand advanced fiber optics in six years to three times as many households as it is currently required to serve and to help its customers transition to other services. 
The bill would have required the public utilities commission to map out well-served areas using the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map and the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program — both tools to measure internet, not telephone, connectivity. The map was criticized by opponents of the bill, including the California Public Advocate’s Office, as not being an accurate representation of coverage.
“This bill does not leave any customer behind. This isn’t about taking something away, it’s about ensuring that we have a plan to migrate Californians to superior services,” Baca said in a July hearing.
McKinnor told CalMatters the measure was her “out of the box, progressive” way to get AT&T to pay for infrastructure upgrades instead of spending taxpayer dollars.

But critics say some areas, such as Hacienda, could count as well served while still lacking quality access. There’s no guarantee that other providers would offer reliable alternatives, and the legislation would not have required the fiber buildout to be in the same communities where AT&T seeks to pull out, they said. Many Hacienda households are listed on the federal broadband map as having four internet providers available — none of which are reliable, they said.
“I agree we need to have technology, but only to a point where you are not dropping service for people that are dependent on it,” said Kelli Mathia, immediate past president of the Odd Fellows Recreation Club in Guerneville, down the Russian River from Hacienda.
If AT&T is really trying to upgrade services, why must they pull out copper lines first? Halliday wondered. 
But McKinnor said allowing AT&T to  preemptively pull the lines is only fair.
“I believe in free enterprise,” she told CalMatters. “I can’t mandate a business to spend billions of dollars doing infrastructure and say, ‘Oh, maybe we will give you (the relief) at the end.’”
AT&T’s real goal is to boost its bottom line, said Regina Costa, a Hacienda resident and telecom policy director for The Utility Reform Network, which led opposition to the bill.
“What they really want is to get rid of customers that they do not think are profitable,” she said.
In a shareholder meeting last year, AT&T CEO John Stankey said getting customers off of copper lines allowed the company to “turn down” that service in “low utilization” and “low profitable” territories. “I can turn out the lights, walk away, take cost out of business,” he said.
AT&T’s web of connections
AT&T is already a political juggernaut in Sacramento.
Between 2015 and 2024, AT&T made nearly $3 million in campaign contributions to state lawmakers, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. This year, it contributed nearly $300,000 to lawmakers’ campaign accounts as they considered its sponsored legislation, data from the California secretary of state’s office shows. 
AT&T also reported giving five California lawmakers and two of their staffers $300 tickets to Mexican singer Ana Gabriel’s Sacramento concert on the day the bill died in the Senate Appropriations Committee. The five, all Democrats, were Sen. Susan Rubio of West Covina and Assemblymembers Mark Gonzalez, of Los Angeles; José Solache, of Lakewood; Juan Carrillo, of Palmdale; and Blanca Rubio, of West Covina. All voted for AB 470 this year, with Assemblymember Rubio voting for early iterations of the bill but not casting a floor vote. 
Spokespeople for all five lawmakers told CalMatters that AT&T’s gifts did not sway their decision and that they supported the bill on merit. 
The company spent another $4 million lobbying state lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration about the bill this year, including $2 million spent between April and June, making it the company’s most expensive lobbying quarter in California in 20 years. It spent an additional $354,000 lobbying the utilities commission to influence the state’s carrier of last resort rules and policies around telephone companies’ service quality standards.
AT&T is so powerful in Sacramento, Grosse said, that some legislative aides told him in the past he would not win in a fight against the company. 
“The (party’s) rural caucus can go ahead and they can talk to legislators, but AT&T is spending so much money on elections you are not going to prevail,” he recalled being told. 
On its face, AB 470 had widespread support this year from Californians for a Connected Future, a recently formed coalition of more than 150 disability advocates, chambers of commerce, tribes, community service organizations, local officials and small businesses, including a construction company and a tennis shop. For months, dozens of those groups testified in public hearings and signed identical letters urging lawmakers to pass the bill, arguing it would incentivize modern technologies and ensure more reliable coverage. 
The coalition, which describes itself as “grassroots,” also states it is a “project of USTelecom.” Rhonda Johnson, AT&T’s executive vice president of federal regulatory relations, sits on the trade group’s board. USTelecom received $250,000 from AT&T to lobby on its behalf this year, and also spent between $85,200 and $106,000 running ads on Facebook supporting the bill in the coalition’s name, according to a CalMatters tally. 
It’s a prevalent practice commonly known as “astroturfing,” when corporations or trade groups enlist seemingly unaffiliated organizations for the appearance of grassroots support, said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. 
“If you don’t read the fine print, you’ll assume that … there are a lot of organizations that sincerely support this legislation.”

While the coalition often bragged about the scale and diversity of its membership, more than 80% of member organizations have ties to AT&T, CalMatters found. 
Some of those groups have AT&T’s top leaders serving on their board of directors. That includes AT&T president Susan Santana, who sits on the board of the California Chamber of Commerce. Ben Golombek, the chamber’s chief of staff for policy, most recently served as the west region vice president for public affairs for AT&T. Other AT&T executives, mostly directors of external affairs, double as board members of various local chambers, business groups, foundations and voting rights groups. 
AT&T also pays to be a member of many local chambers of commerce, many of whom support the bill. Of the 28 chambers in support, AT&T is listed as a corporate member of 26 of them. 
Dozens of coalition members list AT&T as a key funder. The California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce calls AT&T an “invaluable” partner. Groups such as the Concerned Black Men of Los Angeles, which provides mentorship to Black local residents, list the company as a sponsor. 
Others, including tribes, youth service groups and senior advocates, have partnered with the company in its $5 billion effort to “bridge the digital divide” nationwide, distributing free laptops donated by AT&T,  hosting “connected learning centers” the company set up across the state to offer free digital access or receiving grants from AT&T to address digital inequity. 
The telecom giant has also sponsored events for some coalition members, from golf tournaments for the San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corps to the 70th anniversary gala of Society for the Blind. 
The financial support can make it hard not to align with AT&T, Pitney said.
“If AT&T has supported you in a material way, you want to make sure that support continues,” he said. “You are likely to look favorably on requests from that organization.”

CalMatters reached out to all organizations and people named in this story for comment. Most did not respond. California Chamber of Commerce spokesperson John Myers said it supported the bill because it made “economic sense.” Lauren Oto, a spokesperson for the California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce, said the group supported the AT&T-backed bill because “it represents a key opportunity for our members to see that technology is being used to improve public safety and expand access to communication.”
Norma Quiñones, executive director of the San Gabriel Valley nonprofit, told CalMatters AT&T’s sponsorship had nothing to do with the group’s support for the legislation. But the nonprofit offers job training to youths, she said, and AT&T is a prospective employer. While acknowledging not knowing much about the bill, she said it would help close the digital divide and expand high-speed internet access to underserved communities like the ones she serves.
“I wanted to build the relationship with AT&T and support their efforts,” she said. “It ultimately ties into our workforce development and our digital equity goals for our young people.”
The sway AT&T has worries residents like Grosse. 
“One of the largest corporations in the world spent (millions of) dollars lobbying on this thing,” he said. “Do you really think it’s in the public’s interest?”
Regulatory change on the horizon?
If potential legislation doesn’t beat them to it, California utility regulators are expected to decide the future of California’s carrier of last resort obligations over the coming months. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is currently undertaking a rulemaking process that seeks to answer questions including who should be providing last resort service, what would count as sufficient coverage and under what circumstances companies could stop doing so.
USTelecom and AT&T have advocated for changing the requirement so AT&T can stop providing this service in all but “populated areas,” and eventually leave those as well.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Community College System (ACCS) will push for raises for instructors in the FY 2027 budget, ACCS Chancellor Jimmy Baker said Wednesday.
Speaking after an ACCS Board of Trustees meeting, Baker said the pay gap between college instructors and K-12 teachers has caused “several hundred” professors state-wide to go and work for high schools.
“We have people here who are, say, teaching machining and students graduate with a certification in machining and go out and make more than the person that was teaching. And on top of that, we’re losing instructors to some of the high schools because of the pay scale,” he said.

According to the ACCS salary schedule for the current school year, D-2 community college instructors in Alabama with no experience in the lowest rank for a nine-month contract make $39,702 per year. 
The salary schedule for the Alabama State Department of Education for the current school year says entry-level K-12 employees with bachelor’s degrees make $47,600 a year.
In order to close the gap, Baker said there will be a concentrated effort to enhance communications between community college presidents, ACCS employees, community members and legislators. 
“What we typically will be doing is keeping all of our presidents aware of what we are trying and wanting to do, then they will be responsible for talking to their local legislators. Then when it gets to the budget committee there will be support there for that,” Baker said.
All funding decisions are in the hands of the Alabama Legislature, which will begin the 2026 session and work on the 2027 budgets on Jan. 13. 
Alan Bates, special assistant to the chancellor, said during a meeting Wednesday ACCS is working to shrink the pay gap.
“[Other education providers across the state] have been able to outpace at times what we have been able to pay our instructors for some of the same quality, some of the same credentialing, and what they’re certified to teach,” he said to the Board of Trustees. “And so you’re looking at anywhere from a $15,000 to $20,000 disparity at times that we’re going to be trying to, over the course of several years, try to decrease that gap, if nothing else.”
ACCS is budgeted to receive $622.2 million from the Education Trust Fund in fiscal year 2026, which began on Oct. 1. 
Baker said work to begin the process of increasing employee pay began last year and that he doesn’t anticipate any issues with securing the funds to help pay community college instructors more.
“[Legislators] will look at the available funds, and they’ll be restricted by that, but I’ve not encountered anyone that doesn’t understand the need to accommodate some method of trying to move the pay scale to an acceptable level,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/March-7-budget-presentation-06-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660
,California,2025-11-13 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California is a high-tax state. Are more taxes a balm for its budget deficits?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-high-taxes-budget-deficit/,California ranks near the top in tax rates but still has structural deficits in its budget. Legislators would rather tax more than cut costs.,"California has long had the reputation — backed by copious data — of being a high-tax state, which made Gov. Gavin Newsom’s declaration last June, in a prerecorded State of the State address, a bit startling.
“Here’s the truth Republicans never tell you: California is not a high-tax state,” Newsom said.
Later he clarified his assertion, saying California’s taxes on low-income residents are relatively lower than those in red states.
“Catering to big business and the rich is also why red states tax their lowest earners far more than California does. They punish you when you’re struggling, but give you a free pass when you’re wealthy,” the governor said.
There’s some truth to that. California’s very progressive income tax system, with the nation’s highest marginal rate of 13.3%, makes its state budget highly dependent on taxing incomes of its wealthiest residents, while those in low- and moderate-income brackets pay little or no income taxes.
Nevertheless,  taxes imposed by state and local governments put California in the highest ranks of the 50 states, not only in total — more than $400 billion a year from all sources — but in per capita terms — more than $10,000 each — and as a percentage of its $3.6 trillion in total personal income.
The Washington-based Tax Foundation ranks Californians’ state and local tax burden 48th, one of the highest in the nation, out-taxed only by New York and New Jersey. 
“California combines high tax rates with an uncompetitive tax structure, yielding one of the worst rankings on the Index,” the Tax Foundation says.
The state’s $322 billion 2025-26 budget counts on $297 billion from about a dozen different taxes, while cities, counties, school districts and other local agencies take in another $100 billion or so, primarily from property taxes and local shares of the sales tax.
The budget anticipates $207 billion in general fund revenues. So far revenue is running a bit ahead, but general fund spending is budgeted at $226 billion. Maneuvers to cover the gap include shifting $7.1 billion from emergency reserves, pushing the June 2026 state payroll into the following fiscal year and tapping special funds for loans.
State budget experts call it a “structural deficit” that will continue indefinitely in the absence of either sharp spending reductions or tax increases.
There’s little appetite for the former in a Legislature dominated by Democrats but some support for the latter. The California Taxpayers Association recently reported that legislators proposed more than $16 billion in new taxes and fees during the recently concluded 2025 session.
The battle over taxes appears to be headed for the 2026 ballot, with two pro-taxation measures being pushed by public employee unions and other left-leaning groups and one that would create a new hurdle for local tax increases.
One proposal, backed by the California Teachers Association, would make permanent a temporary tax increase on high-income Californians, first approved in 2012 to close a budget deficit and later extended to 2030 via a ballot measure. All of its revenue, as much as $15 billion a year, would go to K-12 schools and community colleges.
A second measure, sponsored mainly by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, would impose a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of California’s billionaires, raising about $100 billion, which would be spent at the rate of $25 billion a year to cover the state’s structural deficit and prop up health care services.
The third, sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, would overturn a state Supreme Court ruling and re-impose a two-thirds voter approval requirement on all proposed local taxes designated for particular purposes.

	During the special legislative session which starts this week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is asking lawmakers to do what they didn’t during the regular session earlier this year: pass a crime bill he backed.
Lombardo brought the “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act,” which sought to enact multiple measures to toughen penalties and broaden the scope of crime infractions on the books, during the recent legislative session. 
Despite receiving backing from Democratic lawmakers, the ranging bill barely missed a midnight deadline the first time around as the regular legislative session was winding down in June.
That iteration of the bill targeted “smash and grab crimes,” called for stricter DUI penalties, and aimed to heighten law enforcement in the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
Using a special session to pass laws on tougher crimes is not only aggressive but a “waste of money,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada. 
“We don’t believe that a special session should be called to add on new crimes when it often seems the only thing the state can do is pass tough criminal law,” he said.
Lombardo, who ran for governor in 2022 while he was serving as Clark County sheriff, introduced his crime bill, Senate Bill 457, in April, but it didn’t receive a hearing until the last four days of the session. 
New language included a sweeping amendment that had significant changes from the original bill, including provisions that would more harshly prosecute crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor – a measure requested by the Nevada Resort Association. The bill would have also included language to re-establish a controversial specialty court to prosecute crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
In the final hours of the session, the state Senate and Assembly passed slightly different versions of SB 457 with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Senate was forced to adjourn before it could take a second vote to approve the last-minute amendments added by the Assembly.
Similar  provisions are likely to make a reappearance during the special session set to start Thursday, say advocates who opposed the bill earlier this year.
The Nevada Retail Association recently held a press conference urging Lombardo and state lawmakers to include harsher penalties for retail crime that were included in the final version of the bill that failed in June.
“Retail crime is an employee safety issue, it’s an economic development issue, it’s a tax revenue issue,” said Bryan Wachter, president of the Nevada Retail Association. “There was a provision that added additional penalties for destruction of property during the commission of these crimes. And we strongly urge the governor and policymakers to make sure that during the special session that that’s included on the agenda.”
The final version of the crime bill lawmakers attempted to pass earlier this year included harsher punishments for people charged with repeated felony DUIs, stalking and possession of child pornography.
It also called for stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
The bill was criticized for its hefty price tag. If passed, the Nevada Department of Corrections estimated it would increase costs by $3.6 million in the current biennium, by just under $7.2 million for the next biennium, and by $42.2 million in future biennium, according to a fiscal note.
Advocates also say the crime bill risked turning back the clock on modest reforms passed by lawmakers with bipartisan support in 2019. 
Opponents of the bill also questioned the need for more crime laws amid a reduction in overall crime.
On his campaign reelection website, Lombardo has highlighted a 10% drop in violent crime – including a 9% fewer murders, 26% less robberies, and 15% less burglaries – since he took office. 
Lombardo’s efforts to be “tough on crime” is less about public safety but “influenced by the interests of Nevada’s powerful resort and gaming industries,” said Shelbie Swartz, executive director of Battle Born Progress.
“The tough-on-crime approach has been repeatedly discredited for its ineffectiveness and failure to produce meaningful outcomes,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lombardo-dana-photo-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As Democrats aim to build on the victories seen throughout the country in Nov. 4 elections, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has highlighted the upcoming Dec. 30 special election for Iowa Senate District 16 as a top priority.
The DLCC, national Democrats’ campaign arm focused on state legislatures, announced Thursday that Democratic nominee Renee Hardman, running to take the Iowa Senate seat, was a “Spotlight candidate” ahead of the election.
Hardman, a West Des Moines councilwoman and president and CEO of Lutheran Services in Iowa, was selected as the Democrats’ nominee for the seat Oct. 23. Lucas Loftin, an employee of Wright Service Corp. in West Des Moines who serves on the boards of In His Light ministries and Homeschool Iowa, was nominated as the Republican candidate for the seat earlier this month.

The Dec. 30 special election is to fill the seat previously held by Iowa Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat, who died Oct. 6 after battling an undisclosed illness. The district is made up of parts of Polk and Dallas counties, including portions of West Des Moines, Clive and Windsor Heights. Celsi had won reelection in 2024 with 70% of the vote against Libertarian challenger Joshua Smith.
DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement Hardman winning the race would have a major impact on Iowa.
“Iowa Senate Democrats shattered expectations when they broke the GOP supermajority by flipping two seats earlier this year,” Williams said. “Renee’s race is an opportunity to make history by electing the first Black woman to the state Senate chamber, while also defending Democrats’ gains. The 2025 elections proved that voters across the country are holding Republicans accountable for the affordability crisis, and the DLCC is proud to support Renee as we elect more state Democrats to fight for working families.”
The special election will determine whether Iowa Senate Republicans regain their supermajority, lost in August when Democrat Catelin Drey won the special election for Iowa Senate District 1.
Drey flipped the seat formerly held by Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton. Drey’s victory was the latest in a string of Democratic wins for state legislative seats in Iowa, as Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, won a January special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer as she joined Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration, and Rep. Angelina Ramirez, D-Cedar Rapids, won a special election in the Iowa House for the seat held by Democrat Rep. Sami Scheetz.
Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, was the only Republican to win a special election in the state this year in March for Iowa House District 100.
The election comes following major Democratic wins in 2025 elections throughout the country earlier in November, notably in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as Zohran Mamdani’s win in the New York City mayoral race.
There is one other special election coming up in Iowa before the Senate District 16 election. On Dec. 7,  Iowans in state House District 7 — covering Calhoun, Pocahontas, and Sac counties, as well as a part of Webster County — will vote to fill the Iowa House seat left vacant by Republican Rep. Mike Sexton, who took a position in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Republican Wendy Larson and Democrat Rachel Burns, both from Odebolt, are their respective party nominees for the House special election.

Vaughn RMC is one of 50 rural hospitals that are eligible to receive funds through the Rural Hospital Investment Program. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A state board overseeing aid to rural hospitals Wednesday approved applications from 50 hospitals and decided how undesignated funds would be allocated.
The Rural Hospital Investment Program Board was created through legislation that passed this spring. It created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. It has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities.
The board unanimously approved all but one hospital that applied to receive funds. Stephen McCormick, vice president of government relations and workforce development for the Alabama Hospital Association, said that Beacon Children’s Hospital in Luverne does not meet the definition of “rural hospital” set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

“It’s a behavioral Hospital in Luverne providing mental health services for adolescents. It’s a wonderful facility,” McCormick said. “I just need to look at the definition to make sure and see their licensing structure to make that determination to the board.”
Beacon may still be approved before a Dec. 1 deadline for the board to publish a list of eligible hospitals, as required by law. Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said that there were two other hospitals that did not submit applications that the board may still consider before the deadline. 
Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey’s office announced that the state submitted its application to the federal government last week. 
The board also unanimously approved a tiered system for allocation of undesignated funds, which are donations that individuals or businesses make without choosing a specific hospital. There will be five tiers with 10 hospitals in each, with the first being hospitals with the highest need. If more than 50 hospitals qualify, the excess will fall in the bottom tier.
Tier One will get 30% of undesignated funds, split between the 10 hospitals. Tier Two will get 25%, Tier Three will get 20%, Tier Four will get 15% and Tier Five will get 10%, according to board member Dawn Bulgarella.
Alabama Hospital Association President Danne Howard said in an interview Wednesday that the hospitals that fall in Tier One will likely be those that did not receive direct donations. 
“Our hope, obviously, is that the undesignated funds will not be a lot, so that most people will make direct contributions to their hospitals,” she said. “So we’re hopeful that the bulk of the contributions won’t be in that undesignated category.”
While any sum of money that a hospital receives will not save it from closing, Howard said that was not the intention of the program. 
“It was never intended to be something that would prevent or save all of the rural hospitals, because it can’t, it won’t,” Howard said. “It is an opportunity for community engagement, for community support of their hospitals, to get some much needed cash into a rural hospital that has needs for something.”
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it.
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
Howard said that the lack of Medicaid expansion relates to rural hospitals’ needs just as much as reimbursement rates, federal cuts to Medicaid and a high number of uninsured patients.
“It was a really good idea, a really good program to help rural hospitals struggling. It’s a tool in their toolbox to provide some financial support for them,” Howard said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12878-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

More than a week after Election Day, results from the Wayne County community of Hamtramck remain in limbo because of dozens of ballots that weren’t counted — some of which may never be tallied.
Thirty-seven absentee ballots were not properly tabulated on election night due to what Hamtramck Deputy City Clerk Abe Siblani called “human error at the counting board.” He said the issue would be resolved during the county canvassing meeting at 1 p.m. Thursday. County officials did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday.
The outcome of the city’s mayoral election may depend on what happens.
It is unclear why the ballots weren’t counted. Mismatches between the number of ballots received and counted are rare, and usually stem from simple counting errors that are corrected before results are sent to the county.
Typically, only “cured” ballots — mail ballots with signature mismatches that have been reconciled — are added in during the canvassing process. Officials say there are potentially also a significant number of those, which could also affect the outcome of the mayoral election: The current margin stands at just 11 votes, with Adam Alharbi narrowly leading City Council member Muhith Mahmood.
Meanwhile, City Clerk Rana Faraj has been absent from the office. Siblani said that city officials told her not to come to work Monday and that he has not heard from her since. Faraj could not be reached for comment.
It’s not clear whether Faraj has been suspended in some way, or why she was told not to appear for work. City officials did not return multiple voicemails asking for information. She did, however, tell TV station WDIV that she “respectfully but firmly” disagreed with the city’s decision. Clerks are appointed by the city manager in Hamtramck, according to the city’s charter, and serve at the pleasure of the manager.
Faraj’s absence is the latest election mystery in Hamtramck, a city of about 28,000 people bordering Detroit that has been rocked by allegations that council members were involved in an election fraud scheme. An investigation into those allegations led to felony charges this year.
“We’re used to scandals at this point,” Siblani said.
In March, Faraj wrote a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel, asking her office to “take action” on alleged election fraud in the city, saying that an unidentified City Council member — whom Faraj later confirmed to be Mohammed Hassan — “acts as though he’s above the law.”
Nessel later requested a special prosecutor to investigate Hassan, council members Abu Musa, Muhtasin Sadman, and Mohammed Alsomiri, as well as two others. The petition alleged they conspired to collect unvoted absentee ballots from newly naturalized citizens, fill them out, and pay for votes.
In August, Hassan and Sadman were charged with felonies. Felony charges against Sadman were later dropped after two subpoenaed witnesses failed to appear, The Detroit News reported last month, although he still faces a misdemeanor charge. Court records show Hassan is set to have a jury trial in April.
No others have been charged.
Despite the investigations, Musa and Nayeem Choudhury — who was one of the others named in Nessel’s petition — both won council seats last week, according to unofficial results. Just before the August primary, footage from surveillance cameras appeared to show Musa allegedly handing a driver bundles of ballots to place into a city drop box. Michigan State Police say they are investigating; Michigan law allows only family members or those in the same household to return ballots for voters.
The repeated irregularities have shaken some voters’ confidence in the city’s electoral processes. Several voters told Votebeat on Election Day that they felt charges of election crimes should disqualify a candidate.
Rich Lash, a Hamtramck voter, said he turned up to vote on Election Day despite the scandals because he felt it was his civic duty. He was voting for new people to “shake it up,” he told Votebeat, particularly after hearing from a number of family and friends that his vote wouldn’t matter.
“I’m pessimistically hopeful,” he said just a few hours before polls closed.

The obstacles we face are daunting and the outcomes are uncertain, but, to prevail, we must continually remember our collective power — and use it. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  James Lyall: People power can rebuild our democracy.","This commentary is by James Lyall, executive director at the ACLU of Vermont.


At this moment in our history, I’ve been reflecting on the famous words often attributed to Alice Walker: “The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.” 
Since taking office 10 months ago, the second Trump regime has sought to intimidate and coerce people into giving up their power, and in some instances it has succeeded.   
And yet, the collective power of individuals and communities to show up for one another, assert our rights and resist authoritarianism remains — and our efforts are making an impact every day, in courthouses, state houses and local communities across the country.  
The Trump administration was always going to face strong resistance in the courts, given its extreme disregard for the rule of law, and much of that litigation has been successful.   
True, the current Supreme Court in some cases has rubber stamped Trump’s abuse of power. But groups like the ACLU and Democracy Forward, as well as state attorneys general have stalled and defeated many of the worst excesses through hundreds of lawsuits.  
Those wins are piling up, and the fact remains most judges have a deep understanding of and respect for constitutional law. The First Amendment is alive and well, as reflected in a fiery decision out of Massachusetts rejecting the Trump regime’s assault on academic freedom.
The courts alone will not save us, but they offer an important check on the executive branch and can defend the constitutional foundations that exist to guard against autocracy. 
In Vermont and nationwide, there are many examples of other leaders and institutions who have stood up to federal overreach and abuse of power with the backing of their local communities. 
In February, following a series of threatening executive orders, the Vermont School Board Association briefly removed its policy on the rights of trans students. Community members mobilized in protest, and the policy was quickly reinstated — with an apology. Educational leaders reaffirmed the state’s commitment to fostering inclusive classrooms and protecting the rights of all LGBTQ students. 
In August, the Scott administration refused federal requests to send National Guard troops to Washington, asserting that the governor “does not view enforcement of domestic law as a proper use of the National Guard.” 
And in September, Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas refused to share Vermonters’ voting information with the federal government, citing state law protections that prohibit such disclosure. “[B]y fifth grade, it had become very clear to me that when there’s a bully on the playground, you are not going to win by trying to duck.” 
Faced with a hostile federal government, Vermont leaders have mostly—if not always—risen to the occasion in resisting empty threats and legally dubious demands.  
In the legislature, the ACLU and our partners are working to strengthen our defenses — including  “shield laws” to defend Vermonters’ bodily autonomy, funding for immigration services and more — though there is still far more to be done to meet the moment. The ACLU’s Firewall for Freedom provides a roadmap for state policymakers to enhance legal protections for vulnerable communities in the coming year. 
Most significantly, however, people are not waiting for elected leaders to act — they are showing up for one another every day. More than 7 million people in 2,700 communities mobilized for historic No Kings rallies last month. Federal government incursions have consistently been met with creative, peaceful protest nationwide. 
In Vermont, nearly 170 civil society organizations, including small businesses, faith groups, libraries and nonprofits, have signed on to a statement of solidarity, demanding bold leadership and commitment to our shared values of Freedom and Unity. More than 3,000 national groups have joined a similar initiative. 
For all the chaos and damage caused by the Trump regime, we must not lose sight of these actions and our many victories big and small. We must continue to urge leaders not to reflexively obey unlawful federal demands and to always assert Vermont’s laws and values to the fullest extent.
And, we must continue to recognize our collective strength, as well as the tactics and strategies that have served resistance movements worldwide: 
Be proactive and prepared. Share information and resources. Seek unity and solidarity with diverse people and organizations. Do not comply prematurely or obey unlawful commands. Protest, peacefully. Remain nonviolent, always.  
And perhaps most importantly, demand solutions that work for all of us: instead of attacking our communities, our government should be ensuring everyone’s basic needs are met. 
None of this is easy. The obstacles we face are daunting and the outcomes are uncertain, but, to prevail, we must continually remember our collective power — and use it.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Some 300,000 people covered by Indiana’s Medicaid program will have less than two months to change their health insurance company as state officials are kicking MDwise off the provider list.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration announced Wednesday that MDwise would no longer be among the managed care health plan options for the Healthy Indiana Plan and Hoosier Healthwise programs as of Jan. 1.
Indianapolis-based MDwise, which said it has provided Indiana Medicaid services for over 30 years, has already launched a court challenge to the state’s action.
The four-year contract was signed in 2023. Indiana’s transparency portal shows MDwise has receivhe ed more than $300 million over the last three fiscal years.
MDwise argues that FSSA officials have acted improperly in terminating the company’s four-year contract that was slated to run through the end of 2026, but a Marion County judge denied a request to temporarily block the state’s decision.
The state agency’s action comes as Gov. Mike Braun’s administration has been pushing to stem the Medicaid program’s fast-growing costs — which were projected in April to jump by 9.5% during the current state fiscal year and 7.7% next fiscal year.
“Indiana Medicaid exists to provide dependable, high-quality care for the Hoosiers who rely on it,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said in a statement. “Our review found that, of the four plans, MDwise was both the most expensive and the lowest in quality. Federal rules require us to maintain at least three plans, and this decision allows us to meet those standards while safeguarding members’ access to care.”
Impact on those covered by MDwise
The agency said those covered by MDwise will not lose Medicaid benefits but must select new coverage from among three remaining providers — Anthem, CareSource, or Managed Health Services. Those not making a selection will be assigned to one of those plans.
MDwise clients will receive letters with detailed instructions on how to select a new plan, FSSA said. 
MDwise, a subsidiary of Michigan-based McLaren Health Care, filed a lawsuit against the FSSA in October, seeking to head off the agency’s decision. Marion County Superior Court Judge Christina Klineman on Wednesday gave the company permission to appeal her decision rejecting a temporary restraining order against FSSA.
MDwise said Tuesday that FSSA officials had ignored the company’s proposed performance improvement plan and a request for a three-month delay in the termination so that the company could pursue a sale to another business.










This begins a series of actions that will lead to a chaotic transfer of 300,000 Medicaid health care plan enrollees and the complete destruction of MDwise’s entire business.


– MDwise court filing


“FSSA is trying to avoid paying the true cost of care for Hoosiers,” the company said in a statement. “During discussions with FSSA in September, it became clear that FSSA’s real motivation for pursuing a termination was not MDwise’s performance, but rather because the State’s policies put Medicaid spending on an unsustainable path.”
The state’s decision risks disrupting medical care for MDwise clients, including pushing some to other insurers whose networks don’t include the same health care providers, the company said.
“Instead of working together toward an orderly solution, the state has chosen a rushed path that jeopardizes care for hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers,” the company said. “MDwise presented multiple proposals to ensure a smooth, responsible transition — all of which have been ignored.”
“Despite this setback, MDwise is not giving up. We remain committed to finding a responsible path forward that preserves access to care, protects local jobs and honors our 30-year legacy of serving Indiana’s most vulnerable residents.”
Indiana Medicaid covered about 1.7 million people as of October, according to an FSSA online dashboard. Among the plans offered under Medicaid, Anthem covered 36%, with MDwise and Managed Health Services following at 17% each.
FSSA officials did not immediately have an estimate of cost savings by dropping MDwise.
“The state does anticipate there will be savings from the MDwise termination because members will be assigned to health plans who have better quality ratings and manage members more efficiently,” FSSA Deputy Chief of Staff Marcus Barlow told Indiana Capital Chronicle.
The agency judged MDwise’s quality of service based on ratings from the Washington-based nonprofit National Committee for Quality Assurance and regulatory reporting to the state, Barlow said. FSSA also compared MDwise’s reported spending on medical costs to other health insurers working with the Medicaid program, he said.
MDwise fighting decision in court
The company said in a Marion County court filing that the FSSA’s action would cause “substantial disruption to the enrollees’ own health care services, and the irreversible, quick, and painful destruction of MDwise, including the loss of hundreds of jobs at MDwise and the termination of numerous business relationships with its many Indiana providers and vendors.”
“This begins a series of actions that will lead to a chaotic transfer of 300,000 Medicaid health care plan enrollees and the complete destruction of MDwise’s entire business,” a company court filing said.
The judge on Oct. 23 denied MDwise’s request to temporarily block the state from terminating the company from the Medicaid program, writing that she did not see a “compelling likelihood of success on the merits of the action.”
“The harm that MDwise claims it is likely to face is reasonably calculable by the income it stands to lose as a result of the potential termination of the Contracts,” Klineman wrote. “There is nothing in the record before the Court to suggest that MDwise would be harmed in such a manner that it is not able to be made whole with money damages if they are appropriate.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. House took all of October off. In fact, the GOP-led chamber has only worked 14 days since July 25. As Congress sat idle, hardworking Americans faced rising health care costs, farmers battled dangerous market instability, and millions worried over losing necessary food assistance.
It’s time for Congress to show up for the people it serves — to lower costs, raise wages, and protect the freedom to make choices about our own lives. As the communications and policy director for the Rural Democracy Initiative, I worked with 40 local, state, and national organizations — including the Minnesota-based Land Stewardship Project and CURE — to create the Rural Policy Action Report, which offers a roadmap of popular policies lawmakers could implement today.
Here are five priorities to help families, small businesses and rural communities thrive.
1. Fix health care.
To start, lawmakers should reverse the Medicaid cuts and renew the Affordable Care Act tax credits that they allowed to expire to pass tax breaks for billionaires.
More than undoing the damage Congress did this year, we need them to go further: lower prescription prices, support rural hospitals, and ensure reliable care close to home. Access to life-saving services shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code or your income.
2. Stand with farmers, not just corporations.
For farmers, rising health care costs are just part of the growing challenges.
“Our members are feeling the pain of a chaotic trade policy, massive cuts to USDA programs that serve all farmers and rural communities, and the ever-growing threat from monopolies that manipulate the agriculture marketplace,” said Aaron Lehman of the Iowa Farmers Union, a contributor to the report.
With the Farm Bill years past due, it seems Congress only makes time to fund programs for the biggest agribusinesses. But Congress could help develop local markets by investing in local food systems, reinstating the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that helped schools buy fresh food from local farms, and helping farmers protect soil and water. They should retool crop insurance and credit programs so they work for smaller, more diverse farms.
Farmers watched as new tariffs hurt the U.S. soybean market, and boosted sales for Argentina. To top it off, the Trump administration promised Argentina an additional $20 billion bailout gift. Congress must rein in our trade policy and prioritize independent producers, small-town businesses, and workers.
3. Strengthen public schools.
Rural schools are the heart of their communities, preparing students with the skills to compete. But the federal government diverted billions from public schools to private schools with a voucher tax credit that could cost taxpayers up to $51 billion a year — more than the federal government spends on all public K–12 education.
Lawmakers should stop the voucher programs and instead ensure students have properly funded schools with speech and reading services and support for kids with disabilities.
4. Empower workers
Rural workers often earn less, have fewer benefits, and face higher injury rates. When workers are respected and fairly paid, they spend locally and keep main streets alive. But the Trump administration has tried to eliminate dozens of worker safety rules, rescinded an important overtime rule, and ordered immigration raids at work sites across the country.
Congress should protect the right to organize, ensure safe work sites, and guarantee paid family and medical leave.
5. Make essentials affordable
Everyone should be able to afford groceries, medicine and energy bills — but prices keep climbing. Congress must work to lower prices and enable small businesses to be competitive so people have real choices.
Congress should also restore food assistance, cut costs for child care, housing, and energy, and expand broadband access.
Congress needs to work for us, not for the special interests of big corporations and the ultra wealthy.
Rural communities have been overlooked — or actively harmed — by federal policy. The Rural Policy Action Report shows a better path: a practical plan with example legislation to improve healthcare, support farmers, strengthen public schools, stand with workers and lower costs.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)On Wednesday night, the House passed and President Donald Trump signed a spending package that reopens the federal government after a record-breaking shutdown and funds most of it through January.
The House passed the bill 222-209, with most Republicans voting in favor and most Democrats voting no. Democrats largely opposed the measure because it does not extend federal subsidies for health care plans purchased on the individual marketplace, subsidies that are expiring this year.
In final House speech, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill urges nation to ‘stand strong’

Here’s what New Jersey’s House members said about the funding package:
 Rep. Donald Norcross (D) voted no.
“For 43 days, America has been held hostage by this Republican shutdown. While it is a great relief that our federal workers will finally receive their hard-earned paycheck, not everyone is celebrating. There are some Americans who may be getting a death sentence as they lose their lifesaving health care coverage. I’m voting no on the Senate’s proposed government funding bill because lives are at risk.”
 Rep. Herb Conaway (D) voted no.
“I’ve been crystal clear from the start: I won’t support any funding bill without the ACA tax credit. I voted NO on the CR tonight because it fails to meet the moment — and unfortunately, the American people will feel the effects of this failure the most. This fight isn’t over.”
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (Photo by Danielle Richards/New Jersey Monitor)
 Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D) voted no.
“From day one of this shutdown, I’ve been clear: We must protect families from surging health care costs. Families are already suffering under the weight of child care, groceries, and higher energy bills. We had one request from Speaker Johnson: Let us vote to extend the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits and save families thousands on their health insurance premiums. They refused. They didn’t give the American people more affordable health care, so they don’t get my vote.”
 Rep. Frank Pallone (D) voted no.
“I voted NO to cutting your health care. I voted NO to sending your neighbors into bankruptcy because they can’t pay for their health insurance. I voted NO to making your relatives sicker. Republicans simply could not care less. I promise you, I’m going to fight every day in Congress to get your health care back and fight for what Republicans won’t: lower costs, healthier families, and a more prosperous America.”
Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)
 Rep. Tom Kean (R) voted yes.
“Today, I once again voted to keep the federal government open and get back to doing the people’s business. Every step of the way, Republicans stood on the principles of good government, fiscal discipline, and common-sense. We fought to ensure that critical services from air traffic control to SNAP benefits were maintained. This shutdown was a reckless political ploy by Democrats that achieved nothing but unnecessary hardship for American families. The American people deserve a government that works for them — not one held hostage by partisan games.”
 Rep. Rob Menendez (D) voted no.
“The funding bill that Republicans just passed fails to extend the ACA tax credits and will make health care more expensive at a time when so many Americans are stretched thin. Individuals and families in New Jersey are already seeing the damaging consequences of this as they look to enroll in health insurance for next year. That’s why I voted NO.”
 Rep. Nellie Pou (D) voted no.
“I support reopening the federal government – but not at the cost of skyrocketing health care premiums. I am pleased that the longest government shutdown in our history is ending and federal employees like air traffic controllers will finally be paid. I am not pleased that tens of thousands of my constituents will pay an average of nearly $3,000 more for their health care. I am angry that millions of Americans will pay much higher health care costs because of this bad deal. At a time when Americans are struggling to pay record prices across the board, the Republican House tonight voted to raise costs even more. This is unacceptable and so I voted no without reservation.”
 Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) voted no.
“I started off the morning having surgery, resting for few, and then hopping on a train to come to D.C. to try to protect your health care, to make sure that you have affordable health care, to make sure that my constituents are not being priced out, to be able to take care of themselves and have the dignified health care that they deserve. And Republicans just don’t see that, they don’t understand that, they don’t give a damn about that, and it’s horrible. But I’m going to keep fighting for you because that is what you elected me to do.”

Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15, 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Let’s talk about what happens when Josh Hawley gets angry.
Missouri’s senior U.S. senator doesn’t take criticism lightly — whether from the press, his colleagues or anyone he perceives as an enemy. His approach? If you get hit, hit back harder.
It’s not just a defense mechanism. It’s a political strategy. All criticism draws a counterattack, and the conflict itself becomes the story.
Case in point: A few weeks ago, Hawley blasted Ameren Missouri over utility shut-offs and rate hikes, blaming the surge in electricity use from new data centers for “sucking up the electricity off the grid, taking it away from hard-working Missourians.”
That didn’t land well with Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a fellow Republican. In a letter to Hawley’s office, she called his claims “misleading” and warned his rhetoric could “unnecessarily alarm the very people we both serve.”
Instead of a debate on energy policy, Hawley mocked O’Laughlin on social media as a mere “state politician” doing the bidding of her campaign donors.
It’s a familiar pattern that repeats throughout Hawley’s career with almost mathematical precision.
Shortly after Hawley was sworn in as Missouri attorney general in 2017, consultants from his political campaign began working out of his official office, directing government staff and using private email accounts to dodge Missouri’s open-records laws.
When the arrangement was revealed in the run up to Hawley’s 2018 Senate election, he attacked the media, called the story “absurdly false” and painted himself in the campaign’s homestretch as the victim of left-wing attacks.
It wasn’t until four years into his first Senate term that a judge eventually determined Hawley’s attorney general’s office had, in fact, “knowingly and purposefully” violated open records laws to protect his campaign from public scrutiny, ordering the state to pay $240,000 in legal fees. A state audit also concluded Hawley may have misused state resources to boost his Senate campaign.
In 2020, the Kansas City Star reported Hawley was registered to vote at his sister’s home in Ozark. At the time, the Hawleys only owned property in the D.C. suburbs, though they were building a house in Missouri.
Facing questions about his ties to Missouri, Hawley called the Star a “dumping ground for Democrat BS” while his allies dug up the reporter’s years-old stories from college to suggest he was biased.
Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner questioned the cost of expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act — a bill Hawley championed to aid St. Louis-area residents harmed by Cold War nuclear testing. Hawley called Wagner’s comments “shameful” and said she was turning her back on her constituents.
Hawley labeled conservative columnist George Will an out-of-touch elitist (“dont’ you have a country club to go to?”) over a critical newspaper column and demanded Wal-Mart “apologize for using slave labor” over a critical social media post.
In today’s political marketplace, anger is currency. Outrage drives clicks, donations and loyalty.
Hawley thrives in that arena, turning every criticism into proof of persecution that mobilizes his political base and feeds the image he hopes to convey of a warrior fighting the political establishment.
But to Hawley’s detractors, it’s all theater, his outrage little more than a tactic used to distract from tough questions and avoid accountability.
The recent flare-up with O’Laughlin has cooled, but not because of reconciliation. When asked recently by a reporter from Nexstar if he’d reached out to her, Hawley replied simply: “No, I don’t know her.”
For Hawley, the fight isn’t a byproduct of politics — it is politics.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)With the loss of enhanced subsidies for the health insurance she has bought on the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov, Nancy Peske’s health plan will cost $1,163.50 a month in 2026.
That’s more than three times what she paid this year — $372 a month, Peske said Wednesday.
But if there’s one thing she wants everyone to know, it’s this: The higher prices for health insurance aren’t just something that she and other people who buy their coverage on the federal marketplace are facing.
Long before the ACA, Peske learned about “the premium death spiral,” she said.
“The more you raise the price, the more people drop out of the pool. This means you have to raise the price, which means more people drop out of the pool. And it goes on and on and on,” Peske said.
“It’s not just my health insurance that’s going to go up. It’s everybody’s — right?” she said. “We’re all in this together.”
Peske was one of two people who have relied on HealthCare.gov, created as part of the Affordable Care Act, who spoke Wednesday at a press conference in Milwaukee with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).
Baldwin called the press conference  to draw attention anew to the skyrocketing cost of health insurance — and to the failure of Congress to address it in the stopgap spending bill that passed the U.S. Senate Monday, the U.S. House Wednesday evening and was signed by President Donald Trump.
“This is a health and wellness issue,” Baldwin said. “This is an affordability and cost-of-living issue, and this is a quality of life and dignity issue. And it touches every single one of us right now.”
A success amid ‘a broken system’
Health care in the U.S. is “a broken system that prioritizes profits over patients,” Baldwin said. Despite that, she said, the 2010 Affordable Care Act was an important advance for expanding health care access.
She said that was improved by enhanced federal subsidies enacted in 2021 to offset the cost of health insurance for people who must buy their own policies on the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace that was created by the ACA — making insurance more affordable and drawing record numbers of people to the marketplace to get health coverage.
The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025, however, and until this week a Republican stopgap spending bill that passed the U.S. House in September stalled in the U.S. Senate as Democrats pushed unsuccessfully to extend the subsidies.  
“That is what is at the center of the government shutdown and debate in Washington, D.C.,” Baldwin said. “We know the impact of taking away these tax breaks. For 275,000 Wisconsinites, their health care [insurance] costs will double, triple or even more. For 30,000 Wisconsinites, they predict the price will be too high, and that those Wisconsinites will go without insurance altogether.”
A handful of Democratic Senators changed their votes Monday to advance the spending bill in return for a promise of a future vote on the subsidies, with the House taking up the revised bill Wednesday. Baldwin didn’t join them.
“I said the entire time that a handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no real action to lower health care costs was simply not good enough,” said Baldwin of her vote against the bill.
She also forced an amendment to extend the tax credits for a year — a compromise, she said, because she wants them extended permanently, but one she offered “to avoid catastrophe for families across Wisconsin and give folks breathing room while we negotiate longer-term solutions.”
The amendment failed on a party-line vote.
“Every single Republican voted no on my amendment,” Baldwin said. “They chose to send a clear, unmistakable message that they are OK with jacking up health care costs on 22 million Americans.”
Early retirement, then sticker shock
HealthCare.gov user Erica Topps also joined Baldwin’s news conference. Topps took early retirement in April and bought a health insurance policy through the federal marketplace for herself and her college-age daughter that started in June.
At the marketplace open enrollment for 2026 that started Nov. 1, that plan’s premium increased by $1,200 a month and the deductible went from $6,700 per person to $10,600 per person, Topps told reporters She found another plan via the marketplace and is enrolling, but she’s concerned about the future beyond that.
“Part of my plan is to go back to work” so she can get health insurance, Topps told the Wisconsin Examiner, because it will be 10 years before she can qualify for Medicare.
Before taking early retirement, “I did my due diligence,” she said. “I feel like the rug was pulled out from under me.”
Peske is a freelance writer, editor and consultant. She is also a cancer survivor, whose diagnosis two years ago was covered thanks to her HealthCare.gov policy. Going without health insurance is unthinkable, but at the age of 63, she must wait another two years before she can go on Medicare, she said.
Peske told the Wisconsin Examiner that she will scrape together the money to afford her new premium. “I’ll not put a dime into my underfunded retirement account,” she said. She expects to “tighten the belt” on household expenses, “and I will probably cut into my savings.”
Freelancers and small businesses account for 40% of the U.S. economy, Peske told reporters.
“Do you want everyone to go out of business?” she asked. “Should I just do what so many people do and get a much lower paying job at a company? Because I’m desperate for health care. I don’t think that’s the solution. I think you want to keep people like me in business, generating money, adding to the economy, and being able to live, to not die of cancer.”
Seeking inroads with GOP lawmakers
Baldwin said she has been talking with Republicans about finding common ground in increased transparency in the health care system, from insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers and providers.
In addition, she told the Wisconsin Examiner after the press conference, she continues to have conversations with GOP Senate colleagues who have expressed interest in continuing the subsidies to avert the sharp hike in premiums.
None of them were willing to break ranks and vote for her amendment this week, however.
“Those discussions were happening informally, in quiet, not in the public spotlight,” Baldwin said. “But they were afraid to vote on something that they, probably, some of them want, because Donald Trump said you can’t talk about this before the government reopens.”
Baldwin said that the next step will be for the Democrats to settle on the bill that Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has promised they could bring to the upper chamber for a vote.
As much as she favors a permanent extension of the enhanced credits, if the Democrats go that route, “we know it will go down, and it will be on a pretty much a partisan vote,” Baldwin said.
“I want results, so that probably dictates towards supporting something that conceivably does respond to some of the concerns Republicans have raised,” she said. “I’d like to pick the path most reasonably likely to succeed on behalf of the people who sent me to Washington to fight for them.”

Joe Cryan wants all parties to give consent. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey lawmaker wants to alter New Jersey’s law governing the recording of phone calls and other conversations.
The bill introduced by state Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union) would require consent from all parties to a conversation, rather than the one-party consent called for under current law. Cryan said it’s a bid to blunt scams using increasingly robust audio deepfakes.
“I’ve had life experiences relayed to me about people being taped and that taping being used for nefarious reasons. As a result of that, protections really should be discussed,” Cryan said.
Under New Jersey law, a person can record a conversation so long as they are party to it or have consent from at least one person who is. The federal government, Washington D.C., and 38 other states use that same framework, while 11 states require consent from all parties to a conversation.
The bill, introduced last month, has already drawn controversy over its potential impact on news reporters who record interviews and events to ensure they can accurately quote speakers. New Jersey Press Association Chairman Brett Ainsworth said the group opposes the measure as drafted and said it could have unintended consequences outside of the media.
It could bar domestic violence victims from recording their abusers absent the abuser’s consent, limit workers’ ability to record harassment from managers, or prevent whistleblowers from coming forward, said CJ Griffin, the association’s general counsel. Griffin has represented the New Jersey Monitor in a variety of legal matters.
“Even if the sponsor includes an exception to allow the media to record, the bill will still stand in the way of reporting because journalists would lose an important source — whistleblowers and others who have documentary evidence of wrongdoing caught on tape,” Griffin said. “There are also serious constitutional concerns because the public has a First Amendment right to record the police or public officials, for example.”
Ainsworth questioned whether the bill would do much to blunt deepfake scams.
Audio deepfakes generally require a sample of the voice they’re spoofing. That sample can be pulled from existing sources posted online or be purpose-made for the deepfake.
“From my personal perspective, the deepfake issue is a serious one, but I fail to see how two-party consent would be effective. Wouldn’t the faker just manufacture a deepfake anyway?” Ainsworth said.
The use of deepfakes to aid crimes is already illegal. Under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in April, those who produce or share deepfakes with an unlawful purpose — say, to extort or defraud someone — face up to five years imprisonment and fines of up to $30,000.
One-party consent recording would carry similar penalties under Cryan’s bill, which calls for prison sentences of between three and five years and up to $15,000 in fines.
It’s not clear when the bill might be heard by the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee. At present, it has no companion in the Assembly.

In a press release issued last month, the Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources announced that it issued a request for information document called “Nuclear Development Incentives.” 
Through the document, the state hopes to identify specific initiatives that would make the Gem State the preferred destination for companies seeking to invest in nuclear development, state officials said. 
Idaho is already home to Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, a U.S. Department of Energy national lab that describes itself as the nation’s leading nuclear energy research lab. Now, state leaders want to become a leading destination for companies investing in nuclear energy. 
“Idaho’s long-standing infrastructure, skilled workforce, and policy leadership positions the state as an ideal destination for companies seeking to invest in nuclear development,” state officials said in a press release issued Oct. 28. “(The Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources) is eager to learn how Idaho can become the preferred location for nuclear development.”

Through the “Nuclear Development Incentives” request for information, the state hopes to learn key factors that influence site selection decisions, infrastructure requirements and preferences, regulatory and permitting considerations, workforce needs, effective incentives and partnership opportunities, as well as barriers to investment, state officials said. 
Momentum has been building around nuclear energy in Idaho and through the United States in recent months. Idaho National Laboratory officials announced they are in the process of permitting and building the first new nuclear reactors in 50 years, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner told an interim committee of the Idaho Legislature in July that President Donald Trump is ushering in a nuclear renaissance by issuing a series of pro-nuclear executive orders and policies.
And in September Gov. Brad Little announced a new task force intended to advance nuclear energy.
“The world is changing rapidly,” Little said during a September visit to Idaho National Laboratory. “Energy demand is expected to increase by an unprecedented 30% in the near future. We cannot do that with our legacy energy. We are going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy.”  
Responses to Idaho’s request for information are due by 5 p.m. Mountain time on Dec. 12.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana State Police officially unveiled a new era of patrol vehicles Wednesday — blue-and-white Dodge Durangos and Ford Mustang GTs — that ISP leaders said will boost visibility, modernize the statewide fleet and better equip troopers to combat aggressive driving and street racing across the state.
Standing before the 20 newest troopers receiving their first commission cars, ISP Superintendent Anthony Scott called the rollout “a bridge to the future” for an agency balancing tradition with public safety innovation.
“The new classic two-tone design of our police cruiser symbolizes ISP’s mission to serve Hoosiers with pride, visibility and tradition,” Scott told recruits during the morning ceremony at the District 52 post on the east side of Indianapolis.
“While the color scheme is a salute to our past, it’s also a bridge to the future of the Indiana State Police,” he continued, “and a future that each one of you will help forge.”
It’s the first time in 60 years that the agency has used the blue design. Troopers’ cars during the early- and mid-1960s were white over blue but changed to all white patrol cars in 1966.

ISP switched all black patrol cars in 1998, and in 2006 white reappeared as the standard patrol car color, police archives show.
“As these new Troopers begin their service, they carry forward a proud tradition of protecting Hoosiers with integrity and courage,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “The new patrol vehicles are a fitting way to mark this next chapter — honoring our history while equipping the Indiana State Police for the future.”
The updated look is part of a multiyear overhaul of the state’s fleet. 
The 2023 Durangos will phase in as current police vehicles — primarily the long-serving Dodge Chargers — are retired and replaced. The process to replace the older models has already taken several years due to the time needed to outfit and deploy new cars for patrol use.
ISP spokesperson Capt. Ron Galaviz said that once the full transition is complete, the agency will no longer have white patrol vehicles.
“Over the next year, the fleet will look a whole lot different,” he said.
New cars — and a new focus
Public records show the agency spent roughly $26 million to order more than 500 Dodge Durango Pursuit models from Dodge to replace the older Chargers. That older Charger fleet dates back to 2010.
Each fully-equipped unit was estimated at about $50,000, with additional costs for outfitting. The new Durangos, for example, come with updated technology like in-car cameras, radar and push bumpers.
“For more than 70 years, the bond between Stellantis and the Indiana State Police has been forged in strength, reliability, and a shared commitment to public service,” said Ryan Austin, law enforcement program manager, Stellantis, the parent company of Dodge. “We design our Pursuit vehicles with safety, durability, and performance in mind, so that every officer or trooper who steps into one can focus on what matters most: keeping people safe.”

For newly minted Trooper Daysia Tallman, Wednesday’s ceremony marked her first day on solo patrol and the first time taking the keys to a car of her own. The 20 probationary troopers graduated from the academy in July and spent the months since completing field training.
They took possession of their new vehicles and dispersed statewide for the first day of patrol on Wednesday.
“It’s just a really big milestone. Today’s a very important day — and we’re the very first class to have these new vehicles,” said Tallman, a member of the 87th ISP Recruit Academy class. “The trust that they put in you to be able to have your own vehicle — it’s amazing.”
She added that the color and design are intended to improve officer safety.
“It’s supposed to help us be more visible — because now, when you see that blue car, you know it’s a state trooper,” Tallman said. “If we’re on a traffic stop or working a crash, hopefully the new look helps citizens see us sooner and prevents other crashes.”
‘This is my office’
The rollout also marks the first phase of what ISP calls “high visibility patrol,” which includes five marked Ford Mustangs distributed across the state’s five primary areas in central Indiana, Fort Wayne, northwest Indiana, Evansville and Sellersburg. 
The high-performance vehicles are especially intended to address a surge in road rage, reckless driving and illegal street racing across Indiana — and be more visible in the process.
Four of the Mustangs are assigned to veteran master troopers with at least 15 years of experience. Troopers selected to drive a Mustang had to submit a memo to the superiors and were hand-selected by Scott. They also had to undergo specialized driving training.
The Mustangs — equipped with 5.0-liter “Coyote” engines, radar systems, in-car cameras and dash-mounted computers — will help to intercept aggressive drivers before they cause crashes, said Master Trooper Nick Klingkammer, an 18-year ISP veteran. 
State police officials emphasized that the vehicles are meant to deter, not invite, pursuits.

Klingkammer, who’s assigned to District 5 in central Indiana, was among the five selected to receive a Mustang. During a ride-along, Klingkammer called it “a mobile office” and a tool for prevention.
“This is where I spend my day,” he said, gesturing to the vehicle’s compact interior.
His Mustang had just 759 miles when he left the ISP parking lot on Wednesday. The master trooper hadn’t yet conducted a traffic stop when he started his patrol. He expects his first stop to come sometimes Thursday, after technicians make some final electrical tweaks.
“Any trooper who works the road — their office is their car,” Klingkammer emphasized.
He said the Mustangs’ agility and speed will help troopers safely catch up to drivers traveling 90 or 100 miles per hour, or prevent high-speed chases altogether.
“This car has the capability to drive at high speeds,” Klingkammer said. “We have the training to drive at high speeds. But our goal is prevention — to get one person to rethink their mindset, not to get into a pursuit or street race. If that happens, we’ve won.”
The new vehicles are also intended to boost officer safety and public visibility. Klingkammer noted that the “bold” design attracts attention even when parked on the side of the interstate.










It’s just all part of the same goal — make our roads safer.


– Indiana State Police Master Trooper Nick Klingkammer


“I guarantee you I’m the talk of the interstate right now because of these truckers going by,” he said Wednesday afternoon while monitoring traffic on Interstate 70 just east of Indianapolis. “They’re going, ‘Oh my God, they’re in a Mustang.’”
While the cars can accelerate quickly —  hitting 100 miles an hour in about four seconds — Klingkammer said troopers won’t be driving them in snow or ice.
The rear-wheel-drive Mustangs will likely be swapped out for all-wheel-drive Durangos on rough weather days in winter months “to protect taxpayer money” and avoid unnecessary risk.
“At the end of the day, no matter the car, we’re representing our agency, and we want to make sure that we’re doing it in a professional way — where people understand, ‘Hey, yep, I messed up,’” Klinghammer said. “And in doing that, probably nine out of 10 stops that I make, I’m usually getting a ‘Thank you.’ It’s just all part of the same goal — make our roads safer.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over and all we got was the near-cancellation of food assistance just in time for Thanksgiving and a looming explosion in health care costs.
None of the problems that led to the shutdown have been resolved. Instead, a handful of Democrats abandoned their fight to force Congress to address the health care crisis in exchange for rolling back some of the damage the Trump administration did during the shutdown itself. Federal workers are getting their jobs back — for now — and flight cancellations will end just in time for the holiday travel season. Otherwise, we’re pretty much back where we started. 
Democrats are fuming and Republicans are gloating over the end of this game of chicken, in which the party that showed it doesn’t care at all about the pain and suffering of its own constituents is the apparent winner. Stay tuned to see how long the glow of victory lasts as members of Congress go home to face the voters. 
During the fruitless shutdown battle, a couple of politicians from Wisconsin who are not facing election anytime soon showed real leadership. Their focus on serving the needs of real people, not political posturing, was a breath of fresh air, and a model of the kind of public service we badly need.
Gov. Tony Evers deserves a lot of credit for acting quickly to pay out food assistance funds to nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites last Friday as soon as a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the money, which it had been withholding for a week. Evers acted in the nick of time. The Trump administration appealed the decision and, on the strength of an emergency ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, demanded that Wisconsin and other states that had paid out the benefits overnight claw them back. Evers issued a terse response: “No.” 
Thanks to his leadership, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites, including 270,000 kids, were spared from going hungry because of the Trump administration’s capricious cruelty. With the shutdown over, the battle over food assistance has ended and the USDA has said full nutrition benefits will begin flowing to states again within 24 hours of the shutdown’s end. But as Evers said when he seized the moment and released the funds, “It never should’ve come to this.” The feds had the money to prevent kids from going hungry all along. Trump made a deliberate decision to cut off aid, and then to demand that states pay only partial benefits, on the theory that doing so would punish Democrats for refusing to reopen the government on Trump’s terms. 
Evers deserves a lot of credit for his decisive action to protect Wisconsinites from harm.
Another Wisconsin politician who has been working overtime to stave off disaster for residents is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. 
Baldwin has spent her entire career working to expand health care access, including writing the provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they reach the age of 26. She has a reputation for doggedly working across the aisle and, during the shutdown, she never gave up trying to get Senate Republicans to agree to extend ACA tax credits. 
This week, when eight Senate Democrats joined the Republicans on a resolution to reopen the government that didn’t include any language about the coming spike in health care costs, Baldwin forced a Senate vote on an amendment to extend the ACA credits for one more year. Many Senate Republicans had told her they knew the expiration of those credits would drive health care costs through the roof in their states.  
In her floor speech introducing her amendment, Baldwin said: 
“My Republican colleagues are refusing to act to stop health care premiums from doubling for over 20 million Americans. I just can’t stand by without a fight.”
Even as people across the country express shock and dismay, “Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have simply refused to address the biggest increase in American premiums they’ll likely ever experience,” Baldwin said.  
“I’m getting calls daily from Wisconsinites begging me to stay in this fight,” she added. She told her Senate colleagues about a couple from Door County who told her their premiums are going up by over $550 per month because of the failure to extend the ACA tax credits. “Everything is already too expensive. So where are they supposed to find 6,500 extra dollars in their budget?” she asked. 
Another couple from Butternut, Wisconsin, told her their premiums are going from $400 per month to more than $5,000 per month — “that’s $55,000 more a year,” she said. “As they wrote to me, ‘health care tax breaks are not just numbers on paper. They are a lifeline that allows us to sleep at night knowing that we won’t lose everything if one of us gets sick.’” 
Baldwin was back in the state Wednesday where, as Erik Gunn reports, she is holding a series of town hall meetings with people affected by rising health care costs. She is holding out hope that some of her Republican colleagues will come around on the issue. She refused to answer questions about whether she thinks Sen. Chuck Schumer should be ousted from his position as Minority Leader because of the end of the shutdown fight. 
Characteristically, she is keeping her head down and working to build bipartisan support — as she did, successfully, when she persuaded enough Republicans to join her to pass the Respect for Marriage Act protecting same-sex and interracial couples — instead of using it to score political points.
As we move past the shutdown power struggle and into the real fight over people’s lives, we need more of that kind of leadership.

At the Delaware-sized Converse County Oil and Gas Project, feds illegally issued more than 200 drilling permits, threatening sage grouse, other birds, water and wildlife, conservationists claim.
The post Lawsuit claims feds defied court order halting work in contested Wyoming oilfield appeared first on WyoFile .","by Angus M. Thuermer Jr.
The federal government is skirting a court ruling and has illegally issued more than 200 permits to drill for oil and gas in a controversial Delaware-sized prospect near Douglas, conservationists claim in a new legal filing.
Operators are already drilling wells in the Converse County Oil and Gas Project in violation of a slew of environmental regulations, the Powder River Basin Resource Council and Western Watersheds Project contend in a 108-page Nov. 5 court filing. The legal papers supplement an ongoing case against the U.S. Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management.
Industry drilling activity and federal actions to authorize 5,000 wells across 1.5 million acres threaten 54 greater sage grouse breeding-ground leks and numerous raptor nests, the complaint states. The proposed wells could deplete groundwater and affect pronghorn and mule deer habitat on public and private land across the region.
The conservation groups successfully sued to block the project last year when a federal judge agreed that the government misstated available drilling groundwater “by a factor of 10,000.”
“By plowing ahead with the project despite an unresolved court order halting new drilling permits, the BLM is rubbing salt in the wounds of the communities and species.” Sarah Stellberg
“We won our case in September,” after challenging the project’s environmental impact statement, said Sarah Stellberg, staff attorney at the nonprofit Advocates for the West, which represents the conservation groups. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a temporary injunction in 2024, and the BLM issued no drilling permits for about a year after, Stellberg said.
But in August, the BLM began approving drilling permits based on new environmental reviews and a flawed revision of groundwater, the updated suit contends.
“To avoid that [Chutkan] ruling, BLM started pushing out these piecemeal [environmental] documents, none of which fixed the issues,” Stellberg said. “By plowing ahead with the project despite an unresolved court order halting new drilling permits, the BLM is rubbing salt in the wounds of the communities and species negatively impacted by this behemoth industrial development,” she said in a separate statement.
No production?
An industry group spokesman rejected the conservation claims, saying “it is clear that the only acceptable outcome for these groups is no production at all.” Ryan McConnaughey, in a statement from the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, said the conservation groups failed to point out any harm, yet persist in filing claims.
“Technological advancements in both drilling and reclamation sciences have continued to reduce impacts on Wyoming landscapes while increasing both production and revenues to the state,” the PAW statement reads. “We will continue to vigorously fight these efforts on behalf of the industry, Wyoming’s communities and the people who rely on the good paying jobs found in Wyoming’s oil and natural gas industry.”
The government has yet to react to the supplemental complaint, and the BLM did not respond to a request for comment this week. The BLM claims to have addressed the deficiencies alleged in the original lawsuit by supplementing the flawed environmental report this summer.
Wyoming has joined the lawsuit on the side of the federal government defendants. The state asked Chutkan on Friday to allow a delayed response to the new claims. Wyoming should respond only when the government does — a schedule likely slowed by the government shutdown, according to court documents.

The conservation groups say the government and its court friends, including PAW, should not be allowed extra time. Conservationists “face substantial prejudice and irreparable harm to themselves and the environment,” court papers say. “Principles of justice” require the case move forward expeditiously, the groups state.
“BLM should not be permitted to continue approving oil and gas development during the shutdown while simultaneously claiming the shutdown precludes it from defending those very actions in court,” reads one motion from the environmental groups that references the record federal closure.
Devon Energy, called out in the suit for recently preparing drilling sites, did not respond to a query about the environmental embroglio. The Oklahoma company advertises on its website “environmentally responsible production,” and “a culture of health, safety and environmental stewardship.”
Whistleblower
The drilling plan, promoted by Devon, Chesapeake Energy Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Northwoods Energy and EOG Resources, Inc., ran into trouble at the beginning when a BLM whistleblower claimed the agency was dismissing worries about migrating and nesting raptors. The BLM fired him in 2021, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, for doing his job.
In 2020, in the waning days of President Trump’s first administration, the government approved the project.
“The Converse County Project is a capstone of the first Trump administration’s push for ‘energy dominance’ in public lands management, and its efforts to relieve the fossil fuel industry from federal environmental safeguards, including under the Clean Air Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse Plan Amendments,” the latest filing states. Drilling would majorly affect air quality locally and regionally, including in national parks. The drilling program abandons traditional wildlife protections like seasonal drilling restrictions, conservationists contend.
Among the new court charges is that the BLM is issuing drilling permits based on yet another flawed groundwater analysis and without allowing the public to comment. Up to 283 wells have been approved recently, most of them illegally, the suit contends.
Many issues in the original suit remain unresolved, Stellberg said, because Judge Chutkan did not need to address them after she found the first fatal groundwater flaw.
The lawsuit seeks to resolve whether the government can regulate landscape disturbance, destruction and other impacts from oil and gas wells that are drilled on private property but access both private and public resources locked underground. Such wells are known as fee/fee/fed wells, acknowledging the split ownership and interests.
The BLM says it has no authority to regulate impacts on such wells; conservationists disagree.
Federal analyses also fail to take a comprehensive look at incremental harms to the environment as they add up — a concept known as cumulative impacts, the latest filings contend. Instead, the government is now approving wells on a piecemeal basis.
In doing so, the government is nickel-and-diming natural assets across the sprawling terrain, even after it acknowledged it needs to take a comprehensive look at the project by preparing an environmental report, according to the recent court filings.
“All these other issues are teed up before the court and awaiting a ruling,” Stellberg said.

Women’s Action Network white paper lays out ""low-hanging-fruit"" strategies to increase access and care by pooling resources and investing in low-cost, big-impact programs.
The post Wyoming lags on solutions while maternal care crisis grows, report finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Since 2022, four Wyoming hospitals have closed labor and delivery wards, leaving 16 birthing hospitals for a state spanning 97,000 square miles. Medical workforce shortages, onerous on-call doctor schedules and mounting affordability challenges have only exacerbated the state’s growing maternity care gaps. 
The problem is not unique to Wyoming, but the state lags behind others in embracing and implementing solutions, according to a new Wyoming Women’s Action Network white paper. 
Wyoming, for example, is the only state not to participate in the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an initiative to support best practices that make births safer and improve maternal health outcomes. 
“There are tools that are available to us that really haven’t been a focus of discussion, and could maybe start to make a significant difference,” said Jen Simon of the Wyoming Women’s Action Network. Like so many complicated issues, Simon said, “there’s no silver bullet. It’s going to take [multiple] efforts to really address it. And so, let’s start to identify what low-hanging fruit might be.”
That was one goal of the white paper, titled “The Equality State’s Growing Crisis: What maternity deserts mean for Wyoming and how we can turn the tide for moms and babies.” 

This map illustrates that Wyoming is the only state not participating in the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, a quality improvement initiative to support best practices that make births safer and improve maternal health outcomes. (Wyoming Women’s Action Network) 
By collecting baseline data and policy directions, Simon said, the hope is to underscore an array of steps — even small ones — that can lead to more robust maternity care. 
“We do in fact have options,” she said. 
Along with joining the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Care, “low-hanging-fruit” strategies range from distributing low-cost alert bracelets to new mothers to convening an annual summit for sharing best practices. 
Rising challenges, falling births 
A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming, a 2023 WyoFile investigation found. 
This is evident in Fremont County, where moms are opting to temporarily relocate to places like Denver and even the East Coast to deliver babies. It is evident in Rawlins, where families have to travel Interstate 80, a notorious stretch of highway that closes frequently in the winter, to deliver in Laramie. And it is evident in Teton County, where overflow patients from elsewhere in the state are straining OB-GYN providers. 
Lawmakers made maternity care a top issue of study for the 2024 legislative off-season and began to identify a complicated mix of challenges for providing such care in rural places, though they didn’t pass any policies. 

This map reflects birthing facility closures in Wheatland, Evanston, Rawlins, Kemmerer and Riverton. (Wyoming Women’s Action Network) 
Meanwhile, births continue to fall in many Wyoming hospitals, and a fifth facility, Platte County Hospital in Wheatland, temporarily shut down its delivery services in October.For the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee, maternity care was the No. 1 priority again during the 2025 off-season, or interim. 
Committee members discussed the issue in depth in October and acknowledged the problem’s scope is daunting. Proposed measures, such as one they advanced to authorize freestanding birth centers to get Medicaid coverage for midwife births, are merely “band-aids” that could perhaps keep maternity care limping along in its current state, lawmakers said. 
That leads to Simon’s point that Wyoming doesn’t have to focus on large-scale state-level reforms for solutions. 
“It’s such a significant challenge to move things through the legislature in every state, not just this state,” she said. The intent of the white paper is “to really be thinking about what would be accessible for hospitals and providers, and what are some best practices that are really simple and straightforward.”
Training, sharing, legislating
The paper’s more accessible recommendations include instituting an annual, statewide maternal health summit — an effort already underway. There are also training approaches, such as the Obstetric Patient Safety Program, commonly known as OPS, which is designed to help medical providers prepare for obstetrical emergencies. 
Postpartum birth alert bracelets, meanwhile, represent a simple and inexpensive tool that alerts health care providers to patients who have delivered within the previous six weeks. That can help ensure recognition and response to complications such as hemorrhage, hypertensive crises or infection — leading contributors to postpartum maternal mortality.
There are also local-level models, such as a community-wide prenatal access program developed in Teton County, as well as inclusion in national expertise pools. 
“Participation in [Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health] would give Wyoming access to resources, technical assistance, and collaborative partners to better collect and report data, implement strategies to address identified issues, and ultimately improve maternal outcomes,” the white paper reads. 

Since 2022, four Wyoming hospitals have closed labor and delivery wards, leaving 16 birthing hospitals for a state spanning 97,000 square miles. (Wyoming Women’s Action Network) 
It also identifies more-involved strategies aimed at improving local capacity, affordability and workforce recruitment. These include initiatives like expanding physician access to remote support from maternal-fetal medicine specialists, administering matching-funds loan-repayment programs for health care professionals or boosting reimbursement for providing maternity services to Medicaid patients.
The Labor Committee in October voted down draft legislation that would provide for increased Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for OB services and critical access hospitals.
Even though government can play a vital role in improving maternity care, Simon said, she hopes to convey that other meaningful avenues exist. 
“Here’s some things that can be done, that hospitals can decide, that communities can decide, that individuals can decide,” she said. 
Advances 
The paper also highlights some positive steps and strategies that are rolling out in the maternal health realm. 
This year, for example, Megan Baker of St. John’s Health in Jackson became the first Wyoming Section Chair for the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, which connects her with resources for training and improved obstetric outcomes for Wyoming moms.
Baker, the manager of women’s services at St. John’s, has spearheaded initiatives to bolster the hospital’s maternal health offerings. St. John’s recently became Wyoming’s first hospital to gain a “maternal level of care” designation. She also helped obtain a statewide grant for OB safety courses and acquire alert bracelets for her facility.

Wyoming medical professionals and hospitals will need to work together to combine resources to create a stronger network, Baker said. She is also a proponent of small-cost, big-impact programs like the alert bracelets. 
“I think we have to look at things differently,” she said. “Share resources, share people and figure out how others are doing it.”
If Wyoming’s trend continues, experts worry that mothers will put off or forgo prenatal care, travel long distances in difficult weather or give birth in emergency rooms with nurses who aren’t trained in labor and delivery, which could have dangerous or even deadly results. 
The erosion in care also poses existential threats to communities, as adequate health care is crucial to attracting young families to rural towns, state leaders say. 
“Being able to have a baby, safely, in Wyoming is a harbinger of our state’s present and future prospects,” Wyoming Women’s Action Network Board Member and Teton County Commissioner Natalia Macker said in a release. “The health of our moms, babies, and families is a clear indication of how healthy our hospitals, communities, and economy will be.”

Respecting tradition isn't about propping up old industries, but saying yes to new ones, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming must seize her opportunities appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is sitting on a wealth of opportunity. We have abundant natural resources, well-established core industries and room to grow. Many other states do not have these same prospects. We are small, but that allows us to be nimble. We are one of the last places in the U.S. where an enterprising company can build a new industry from the ground up. We can build new things without the burden of having to tear down what came before. We are fresh ground.

Opinion

Despite this advantage, we risk squandering our chances. We have become too focused on recreating the past at the expense of building the future. Historically, our strength has come from our willingness to say yes to opportunities. Recently, however, we have seen too many in our communities and in our leadership who would stop anything that benefits the next generation out of fear that it might upset their comfortable status quo. They do not care about building a legacy; instead, they are focused on maintaining what they already have. It is a short-sighted viewpoint.
The most glaring example of this is the recent decision by Radiant Nuclear to abandon its proposal to build a manufacturing facility in Bar Nunn. The reception this company got from some segments of our state was shocking in its hostility. By showing the company that they were unwelcome, the naysayers cost their community a potentially valuable new industry. Where would Wyoming be if these people were here in the 1970s? Wyoming coal was a small industry then, and national market changes led to rapid development, often in difficult circumstances. Had our current attitude prevailed then, Wyoming coal may never have gotten off the ground, and our state would be far worse because of it.
If Wyoming is going to be anything more than a place for more prosperous states to get their raw materials, we must be open to new opportunities and industries. Our world does not stay static. It changes by the day including the industries that make our society work. Wyoming in the early 1900s was dominated by the agricultural industry. By the late 1900s, resource extraction led our state’s economy. In this new century, we must choose to take advantage of what comes next. Be it new energy, data and computing, advanced manufacturing or something else entirely, we must recognize that the Wyoming of a century ago is not the Wyoming of today. We should love our past, appreciate it and recognize that it is where we came from, not where we are going.
Many wish that Wyoming would not change. Most of us live here because we have chosen it. We love it as much for its hardships as its benefits, and many are uncomfortable with the possibility that the things we have always associated with our state may be replaced. We must remember, however, that we are a frontier state. The people who came here did so because it was a land of opportunity. We did not have “legacy” industries to fall back on. They came here because it was a place that valued growth, building something great and an entrepreneurial spirit. I fear we are losing the spirit of our heritage by focusing too much on what they built rather than on what we can build.
Today, there are many opportunities that our state could take advantage of. Alternative energy production would be well-suited to Wyoming, if we welcome it. Data centers are already a blossoming industry in some parts of the state and have the potential to inject millions of dollars into our communities through both employee salaries and tax revenue. Our workforce is well-suited to advanced manufacturing, as evidenced by companies like Maven, Weatherby and others intentionally locating themselves in Wyoming. Each of these has the potential to transform our communities for the better, but we must remember that transformation inherently means change. Our state will not look the same in the future, sometimes literally. Each new industry will bring with it opportunities and challenges. Nevertheless, we must be willing to take those challenges on.
Wyoming is not a place stuck in time. We are not immune to the outside world’s impact. We cannot keep Wyoming the way it used to be, because the things that drove that world are no longer the same. Our state’s history is full of people who came here to build something new. Our heritage is based on seizing opportunities. Let’s focus on that part of who we are, so that the Wyoming of tomorrow is just as good as the Wyoming of yesterday.

A constitutional amendment first proposed after Watergate would address questionable pardons, writes guest columnist David Adler.
The post Trump’s pardon of crypto king makes case for constitutional reform appeared first on WyoFile .","In a Nov. 2 interview with “60 Minutes”, President Donald Trump pretended that he did not know Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, the cryptocurrency billionaire whom he pardoned, even though in 2023 Zhao pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Specifically, Zhao had failed to implement anti-money laundering procedures. 

Opinion

For those who think this a minor or vanilla offense, consider that the U.S. government had accused him of inflicting “significant harm to US national security,” and said that he had “violated US law on an unprecedented scale.” In the pursuit of profit, Binance’s money-laundering acts had allowed “money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.” The terrorists included Hamas and al-Qaida. Why did Trump pardon such a criminal?
Trump said he had been told that the prosecution of the crypto king was an example of a “Biden witch hunt.” Trump said that Zhao “was treated really badly by the Biden administration,” although he claimed that he had “no idea who he is,” but acknowledged, in the same breath, that “he is a successful guy.” Skeptics doubt Trump’s explanation. 
How about self-aggrandizement as a motive for Trump’s pardon of Zhao? Zhao’s company has had business dealings with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency company owned by Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr. While seeking a pardon, Zhao hired lawyers and lobbyists with connections to the Trump administration and struck a deal with Trump’s sons that was expected to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for the Trump family for years to come.
When “60 Minutes” host Nora O’Donnell asked Trump if he was concerned about “appearance of corruption,” Trump replied, “I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it.” Trump stood alongside his sons in 2024 when they rolled out the family’s cryptocurrency business. The specter of self-aggrandizement, or more pointedly stated, a “pay-to-play” pardon, raises anew the need to amend the Constitution to check the constitutional grant of the pardoning authority to the president.
Various presidents have granted pardons that have rightly faced backlash. When Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974 for “all” the offenses that “he has committed or may have committed” since his election, Ford sought, in his words, to free the nation from the paralysis of Watergate and spare Nixon from potential prosecution and his family further humiliation. 
Ford declared to America: The rule of law has prevailed. On the contrary, the Nixon pardon foiled the application of the rule of law. If, and when, Nixon had been tried and convicted for his illegal acts, perhaps Ford might have found grounds to pardon the humiliated ex-president, but all he accomplished in granting a pre-trial pardon to Nixon was to spare the Watergate president. 
Americans were deprived of the opportunity to learn whether the rule of law and the criminal justice system could bring an errant president to heel, and whether the rule of law would enjoy widespread support when a president is forced to stand criminal trial. 
The Nixon pardon, alone, it seemed to me years ago, was sufficient to justify a constitutional amendment to place checks on the presidential pardoning authority. In a peer-reviewed, scholarly article, I argued in favor of Sen. Walter Mondale’s proposal in 1974 for a constitutional amendment that would arm Congress with the power to check presidential pardons that seemed, well, unpardonable. Mondale’s proposal stated: “No pardon granted to an individual by the President under Section 2, Article II, shall be effective if Congress by resolution, two-thirds of the members of each House concurring therein, disapproves the granting of the pardon within the 180 days of its issuance.”
In practice, few presidential pardons would be so worrisome to Congress that members would intervene to block it. Only controversial pardons would draw deep concern from Congress. Trump’s pardon of Zhao is such a pardon. His self-aggrandizing exercise of a constitutional power intended to temper justice is so fraught with conflicts of interest that it demands enactment of the Mondale proposal. 
Congress should be suspicious of the motives behind a pardon to a convicted criminal that coincides with his investments to enrich a president’s family. The specter of corruption at the center of the Trump pardon of Zhao deserves scrutiny, even without the Mondale proposal.

The committee also took up a constitutional amendment proposal to forbid the government from shutting down places of worship during a state of emergency. 
New requirements for credit card political donations
Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee) said his bill creating new requirements for political donations made with a credit card online will  ensure there is a “good, secure” process in place in Wisconsin. 
“Let’s acknowledge that we need to know that unlawful sources and foreign entities are not infiltrating our campaigns and elections,” Tomczyk said, and that “citizens are funding candidates here in Wisconsin.”
The bill, SB 403, would prohibit a political committee, political party or conduit from accepting contributions that are made with a credit card online unless the contributor provides their credit card verification value (CVV) or code and the billing address associated with the card is located in the United States. 
If a U.S. citizen is living outside the country and wants to make a contribution from a credit card that doesn’t have a U.S. billing address, then the person would need to provide a mailing address used for voter registration. 
“I’m trying to make elections more secure, the donation process more secure,” Tomczyk said. 
The bill comes as Republicans and the Trump administration have targeted ActBlue — a Massachusetts-based platform that processes donations to Democratic campaigns — claiming that the platform facilitates so-called “smurfing,” a form of money laundering where large sums of money are broken down into smaller, less noticeable transactions and could allow for “straw donors” and foreign contributions. Stakeholders, including ActBlue and Democrats, have said that the action by the administration is an attack on the democratic process.
Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, in his position as chair of the U.S. House Committee on House Administration, launched an investigation into ActBlue asking whether it required CVV information from contributors in 2023. 
The company said at the time that while it did not, it has many other measures in place to confirm the permissibility of contributions and prevent fraudulent transactions including a requirement for passport information if a donor provides an address outside the U.S. 
Steil has since proposed federal legislation that would require credit card verification for online donations. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) expressed concerns over how the bill could create barriers for individuals looking to contribute.
“Why are you trying to ban citizens from being able to donate by credit card?” Larson asked. 
“If they’re not open in the United States, they’re allowed to donate by credit card if they’re providing all the information that the bill outlines. If they don’t have a voting address, it’s kind of odd,” Tomczyk replied. “I’m pretty sure it’d be a pretty small amount of people.”
The authors of the bill also said people could still donate by check and other methods if they didn’t have the necessary information. 
“It sounds like this is just putting up additional hurdles for people who want to donate by credit card and it just seems like, especially for smaller dollar donations, people who aren’t writing a lot of checks,” Larson said. “Most of the people that I know are giving with credit cards because they don’t use checks.”
Larson said the bill could make it harder for people to participate in democracy through political contributions. 
The authors of the bill claimed there have been examples of “smurfing” in Wisconsin, though they provided no specific examples when asked. 
“This is not something that comes up out of the blue. People have been interviewed about contributions that they gave with their credit card that they said they never gave,” Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said. 
“You guys sound like Gargamel as much as you’re talking about smurfing,” Larson said at one point, referring to the fictional antagonist in the Smurfs cartoon franchise. “Come up with an example. Give me some proof really if you want the governor to be able to sign it.”
“In testimony, I don’t think I have to show proof. I have to provide information and… get enough support to pass it through,” Tomczyk said. 
Providing information on constitutional amendments
Lawmakers are also proposing a way to ensure Wisconsin voters have information on the potential effects of constitutional amendments. 
SB 205 follows years of the Republican-led Legislature turning to constitutional amendment proposals as a way to make changes to law without going through Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The most recent constitutional amendment that was approved by voters enshrined voter identification requirements in law, and other amendment proposals are circulating this session, including one to restrict the governor’s partial veto power. 
The committee heard from Tomczyk and Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) on their bill, which seeks to provide information about constitutional amendments to voters ahead of elections. 
“I’ve heard from countless friends and constituents, even people with college degrees and professional titles, all who tell me that every time they vote on a constitutional amendment the wording on the ballot makes no sense to them,” Tomczyk said. “The legalese, if you will, that is used on the ballot, is of course necessary and should be presented, but for regular everyday residents of Wisconsin, it might as well be in a different language. There has to be a way to explain what these amendments do so that people know what they are voting for.” 
“This is only meant to inform voters better about what they are voting for or against,” Tomczyk said. 
The bill would require a notice to go to voters that would include the date of the referendum, the text of the ballot question, the plain language summary of current law, an explanation in plain language of a proposed constitutional amendment and an explanation in plain language of the effects of a “yes” versus a “no” vote.
O’Connor said the Legislative Reference Bureau, the nonpartisan agency that drafts bills and proposals for the Legislature, would be responsible for writing the information in a black box. 
“The black box we cannot touch as legislators,” O’Connor said. He added that the legislation is “non-partisan, bipartisan and voter focused.” 
While the bill only has Republican cosponsors, it advanced through the Assembly Campaigns and Elections committee unanimously with support from two Democratic lawmakers. The bill is also supported by the League of Women Voters, the ACLU of Wisconsin, Disability Rights Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. 
Places of worship constitutional amendment
The committee also took up Senate Joint Resolution 4, a constitutional amendment proposal that would prohibit the state from ordering the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency. 
This is the Legislature’s second consideration of the proposal, which was first introduced and passed by the Legislature during the 2023-25 session. 
The proposal was introduced in reaction to actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic when Gov. Tony Evers’ administration declared a state of emergency. 
Evers’ initial “Safer at Home” order in March 2020 explicitly designated religious entities as essential, though it said any gatherings should include fewer than 10 people in a room or confined space at a time and that people needed to adhere to social distancing requirements as much as possible. It also advised and permitted places of worship to have drive-in services. 
Before the constitutional amendment proposal, Evers vetoed a bill in 2021 that would have prohibited local health officers from taking any action to close or forbid gatherings in places of worship to control outbreaks and epidemics of COVID-19. 
Tomczyk noted an incident at Pilgrim Lutheran Church in West Bend where a law enforcement officer showed up to shut down a service after a neighbor called in to report the gathering. According to a Wisconsin Public Radio report, the incident was a misunderstanding and the police department later apologized to the church.
“In America, in Wisconsin, law enforcement stopped the church service because the government decided that a virus was more important than the constitutional rights of Americans. That is unacceptable,” Tomczyk said. “Many people in our great state seek solace in times of difficulty within their church, synagogue, or other plates of worship. It is critical that we continue to protect every individual’s ability to gather and worship at the times when they rely on their faiths the most.” 
Larson asked Tomczyk whether he was open to holding a religious organization liable if people “get sick and die” because they decide to meet against the direction of a public health emergency.
“No,” Tomczyk replied. 
“So… if there is a deadly pandemic, people are dying… and their parishioners die, you are fine with those deaths?” Larson asked. 
“I’m supportive of people’s constitutional right to gather and to worship at the times that they choose and, and if they make that decision, God bless them,” Tomczyk said. 
According to the constitutional amendment draft, voters would be asked whether the state constitution should be “amended to prohibit the state or a political subdivision of the state from ordering the closure of, or forbidding gatherings in, places of worship in response to a state of emergency, including a public health emergency?”
The proposal received a hearing in the Assembly in May, but has not yet been voted on there. 
If the bill passes the Assembly and Senate this session, it would be placed in front of voters during the November elections in 2026 alongside a slate of other high-profile races, including the one for governor.

They include 38 county sheriffs’ office, three small-town police departments and five east Tennessee constable districts. Constable districts typically consist of one unsalaried individual who is paid fees to serve warrants. 
Two state agencies, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security and the Department of Corrections, have also entered into 287(g) agreements, extending immigration enforcement powers to designated state highway patrol officers and prison guards.

The rapid spread of ICE agreements significantly expands the reach of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement and deportation agenda into interior states like Tennessee, where an immigrants without legal status represent an estimated 2.2% of the population.
Proponents of the agreements say the force multiplier effect of 287(g) agreements, by enlisting police officers, state troopers, emergency management officials, jailers, constables and prison guards, enhance community safety and more broadly enforce the nation’s immigration laws. 
“I decided to do this as there is a right way to enter our country and a wrong way,” said Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt, who in 2019 initiated one of the state’s earliest existing agreements.
“It is a slap in the face for those who have been properly vetted and went through the naturalization process,” Holt emailed the Lookout.
But critics of 287(g) agreements have called them an ominous extension of Trump administration tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Memphis and elsewhere to rely on racial profiling to engage in widespread arrests and detentions of immigrants with no criminal records. 
Immigrant advocates have long criticized 287(g) agreements for racial profiling, redirecting police to engage in low-level immigration violations instead of community safety and tasking police officers with limited training to interpret complex immigration laws.
“The Trump administration has really converted most of government – most of Homeland Security and much of the Department of Justice – to do immigration enforcement,” said Lena Graber, senior staff attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which advocates for immigrant rights.
“Are we just outsourcing all of our local officials to the federal government and its agenda?” she said. 
‘Unprecedented reimbursement opportunities’
Tennessee agencies who have partnered with ICE in recent months may have powerful incentives.
ICE agreements in the past have come with no financial compensation beyond training provided by federal authorities and IT equipment allowing communication with federal immigration databases. 
But the Trump administration included $14 billion in federal funding in the Big Beautiful Bill Act in July to fund financial incentives for local and state law enforcement agencies who agreed to ink 287(g) deals by Oct. 1. 
They include full reimbursement for the annual salary, benefits and overtime for each 287(g) trained officer, $7,500 for laptops and cell phones per trained officer and up to $100,000 toward the purchase of agency vehicles.
Participating law enforcement agencies are also eligible for bonuses that range from $500 to $1,000 per officer based on meeting benchmarks for the “successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICDE’s mission to Defend the Homeland.”

“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” Madison Sheahan, ICE Deputy Director, said in a message to potential state and local partners. 
In September the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 330,000 officers across the nation, urged police departments to enter 287(g) agreements to take advantage of the unprecedented funding opportunities.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the amount or timing of potential reimbursements to Tennessee law enforcement agencies.
Tennessee lawmakers, in a special session that convened last year, also approved incentives for agencies that partner with ICE, offering $5 million in grants to local law enforcement agencies that enter 287(g) agreements. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the status of the grant distributions. 
Small town police to become immigration ‘task forces’
State and local law enforcement agencies can opt to enter one of three different model agreements with ICE.
They include a “jail enforcement” agreement that gives local officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of individuals who are already incarcerated.
A spokesperson for Rutherford County Sheriff Mike Fitzhugh, who faced community pushback when his county’s jail enforcement agreement was made public, stressed the work his deputies did would remain unchanged.
“He is entering a memorandum of understanding with ICE, a continuation of what the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center has done with ICE since 1996,” the spokesperson said. “This memo will allow the deputies to have access to a federal data base.”
Tennessee law already requires local jails to cooperate with ICE officials to verify the immigration status of individuals coming into custody.
A “warrant service officer” agreement allows jailers to serve immigration warrants that authorize the arrest of individuals for civil immigration violations on those in their custody.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

The “task force” model gives local and state law enforcement officers powers to enforce immigration law on routine patrols and traffic stops — the most expansive delegation of immigration enforcement powers.
Thus far, 12 Tennessee state and local law enforcement agencies have adopted the task force model, including the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
Other task force agreements with ICE include three constable districts in Bradley County, one constable district in Monroe County and one in Polk County. 
Constable districts consist of one elected official who serves as a process server for local courts. They are not required to have police training, but the jobs are often filled by former police officers.
Constables in Bradley, Monroe and Polk Counties did not respond to questions from the Lookout.
The Putnam County Sheriff, the Sevier County Sheriff, Sevierville Police, Sparta Police and the Mosheim Police Department, which operates a force of five people in a town of 2500 in rural northeast Tennessee, has also agreed to serve as a task force agency. 
Of the 48 law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements contacted by the Lookout, only the Rutherford and Greene County Sheriff’s offices responded.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Fred D. Thompson Federal Courthouse in downtown Nashville has been the scene of two high profile trials in 2025 with distinctly different outcomes.
During a four-week period in April and May, jurors heard arguments in the corruption trials of former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his one-time chief of staff, Cade Cothren. 
The two were found guilty of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering for their roles in creating a fake political consulting firm that they used to gain business from state lawmakers under fraudulent terms. 
After none of his former colleagues testified on his behalf, Casada was sentenced to three years in federal prison and a $30,000 fine, which seems to me like a pretty light sentence for betraying the public trust. 
In June, weeks after the Casada-Cothren trial ended, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, was hauled into the same courthouse to be tried for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Same courthouse, different outcomes: Trials held weeks apart in Nashville’s Fred D. Thompson Federal Courthouse reveal a diametrically opposite standard of justice. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Contrast the disparate treatments the two face: Casada, who, as prosecutors pointed out, never expressed an ounce of regret for deceiving his colleagues — some of whom he had worked with for nearly two decades — gets to skate with a Nov. 6 pardon from President Donald Trump, no doubt thanks to a call to Trump from a powerful mutual friend. 
Abrego Garcia, originally from Venezuela, came to the U.S. without legal permission at age 16 in 2011 but was granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to the danger he would face from gang violence should he return.  
Now, the married father remains not only in custody but in a dreadful legal limbo, continuing to face what appear to be — no pun intended — trumped-up human smuggling charges that federal prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop, charges which were only filed by the government in April, after he’d been erroneously deported. 
One can argue about the appropriateness of Abrego Garcia’s move to the U.S. without following legal channels, although I find it reasonable a 16-year-old might want to escape gang violence in his home country. But what’s not arguable is the injustice in him continuing to be prosecuted for a mistake Trump officials made in deporting him against court orders. 
Supporters of Casada and Cothren, who forged a fake name on an IRS document to form their business, claim the pair were unjustly targeted out of political motivations. 
Politico quoted an anonymous White House official accusing federal law enforcement of being too hard on the Tennessee twosome. 
“The Biden Department of Justice significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue involving constituent mailers — which were billed at competitive prices, never received a complaint from legislators, and resulted in a net profit loss of less than $5,000,” the official said in a statement. “The Biden DOJ responded with an armed raid, perp walk, and suggested sentences exceeding 10 years — penalties normally reserved for multimillion dollar fraudsters.”
There’s a lot wrong with this statement, starting with the fact that the investigation into Phoenix Solutions and Casada — and a subsequent raid of he and Cothren’s offices and homes — came in Trump’s first term.
And while the pair did indeed see little in financial profits, the money isn’t the point. 
Glen Casada: The rise and fall of a House Speaker

Casada started the fake Phoenix Solutions only after being bounced as speaker of the House by legislators who had elected him to the role only eight months earlier, members of the Republican House Caucus who gave him a ‘no confidence’ vote. 
He earned their scorn for his heavy-handed leadership once elevated to speaker, spending funds to renovate his office, including installing white noise machines, paying Cothren nearly $200,000 annually and allowing Cothren to eavesdrop on meetings, hiring additional staff as “hall monitors” to keep tabs on Republican caucus members and keeping “bill kill” lists targeting legislation sponsored by House members from both parties. 
In 2020, after being stripped of his House speaker role, the Tennessee Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance — a bipartisan board — fined Casada $10,500 after an audit revealed he had failed to provide receipts for nearly $100,000 in expenditures for his political action committee.  
With Casada, corruption is not a bug but a feature. He hasn’t faced injustice: he’s faced no justice for his wanton misuse of public office.
Criminal justice advocates often speak of a two-tiered justice system in the U.S., but I argue differently. The justice system isn’t two-tiered: simply put, a comparison of these two cases shows the justice system is currently dead. 
When Casada, the man who once held the third-highest position of power in Tennessee, a man who held public office for more than 20 years, gets off with a get-out-of-jail-free pass and zero accountability, no other conclusion is suitable.

State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt said schools have lost 2.5% of their students in the past year.
The state’s enrollment is now 234,957 students for this current school year, Blatt shared on Wednesday during a state Board of Education meeting.
“Fifty-three of 55 of our districts did decrease in enrollment this year,” Blatt said, noting only Tyler and Doddridge counties had an increase in student population.
A new West Virginia enrollment report showed a 6.5% decline from when the state had 250,899 students in the 2021-22 school year.
School officials have pointed to the state’s ongoing population decline as a major reason for the enrollment drop.
“There’s declining enrollment in our state as a whole and that’s affecting our school systems,” Blatt said.
West Virginia experienced the sharpest student population decline in the nation from 2020 to 2024, a time period that included the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Multiple school districts have proposed school closures or consolidations this year. Last week, the Roane County Board of Education voted to close two elementary and middle schools at the end of the 2025-26 school year. The county plans to consolidate students into other nearby schools. The state Board of Education will have to approve the plan. 
Roane County School Board President Jeff Mace said funding was part of the problem, MetroNews reported. He said the state’s school funding formula needs to be modernized and should focus more on the needs of students rather than student enrollment.
“I believe if we don’t invest in our education, we’re just going to continue to drive all of our young people and our young talent out of the state and we’re going to prevent people from coming in,” Mace said. 
State school board President Paul Hardesty has already called on state lawmakers to fix the school funding formula during the next legislative session to prevent more school closures in the rural state. 
According to the state Department of Education, 16 public schools closed in 2024.
Micah Whitlow, director of the West Virginia Department of Education’s Office of School Facilities, said that counties are making these decisions “based on real problems.”
“These things aren’t done on a whim or they just woke up one day thinking about this. Some of them are staff shortages, finances, deteriorating facilities. Some of these it’s all those things together,” he said.
Expired pandemic relief funding and students opting out of public schools to use the state’s broad school voucher program – The Hope Scholarship – have also put a financial strain on public schools. Around 19,000 students are using the voucher program this school year, typically at private religious schools. 
The enrollment report showed that public schools served 477 students using the Hope Scholarship; students using the Hope program can pay to take public school classes. Public schools also served 1,336 Hope Scholarship students that were not funded, according to the report. 
More than 4,000 children are attending virtual schools, which are considered public schools in West Virginia. Most of those students are enrolled in virtual charter schools. The state’s number of charter students has increased since the 2023-24 school year when 2,270 were enrolled.
Overall, most West Virginia students continue to be served in public schools as leaders grapple with financial issues, which can lead to less staff in schools.
“We can say that 98.2% of our students are still served in our public schools,” Blatt said.

(Photo by Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images)At least five lawsuits are underway in West Virginia challenging the state mandate requiring vaccination of schoolchildren, which permits no religious exemptions. Protection of religion from government intrusion is a fundamentally serious matter, not a culture war issue. But so is the protection of our children against serious and sometimes fatal diseases. What is the way out of this?
The background
School attendance is mandatory for all children aged 6 to 17, but they must first be immunized against chickenpox, measles, mumps, polio and six other diseases. Medical exemptions are available, but West Virginia is the only state that has never allowed religious exemptions. Four other states have joined West Virginia in the last decade by eliminating religious exemptions. Public polling that shows large bipartisan majorities of West Virginians oppose religious exemptions.
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 3-15 of the West Virginia Constitution prohibit government action that infringes the free exercise of religion. A claim pending in West Virginia federal court alleges that the vaccine mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause. But the U.S. Supreme Court held as early as 1905 that vaccine mandates are constitutional, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond has specifically upheld the West Virginia vaccine mandate against a Free Exercise Clause challenge.
In 2023, the West Virginia Legislature enacted the Equal Protection for Religion Act. It provides that no state action may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless for a compelling governmental interest and using the least restrictive means. But neither the title nor the text of the act indicates that the purpose of the law is to override the vaccine mandate law.
In fact, the Legislature has refused several times to insert religious exemptions into the vaccine mandate, most recently during the 2025 session. Obviously, the Legislature did not think the 2023 act had added religious exemptions — otherwise a new law doing that would not have been necessary.
But this result was not satisfactory for Gov. Patrick Morrissey. He tried to create the law the Legislature rejected by issuing Executive Order 7-25. The order directs state health officials to establish a procedure for accepting “religious or conscientious” objections to “one or more vaccine” required by the vaccine mandate.
The governor can control state health officials. But he has no authority over the West Virginia Board of Education. That board has constitutional authority to determine the rules under which state schools will operate. The board of education voted in June 2025 to follow existing law, ignore and accept no religious exemptions.
The litigation
The main question in the lawsuits is whether the Equal Protection for Religion Act even applies to the vaccination mandate. Two judges, one in Berkeley County and one in Mineral County, have said that it does not. A judge in Raleigh County has said that it does.
The Raleigh County case, Guzman v. WV Board of Education, is the most important case because that judge has also certified a class of similarly situated plaintiffs around the state and his ruling on a permanent injunction, expected in late November, will bind everyone whose case has not already been decided.
The Berkeley County judge found that EPRA’s title reveals no purpose to amend other law. He noted that the West Virginia Constitution voids any purpose for a law not stated in its title. The judge also found that the state had a compelling interest in protecting student health and safety. If the plaintiffs didn’t want their children to be vaccinated they had other options for schooling such as private school or home school.
The Raleigh County judge went in the other direction. He argued that EPRA begins with the phrase “notwithstanding any other provision of law.” He ruled that this language “signals legislative intent to override any conflicting provisions.” But the authority cited by the judge actually found that “notwithstanding” language does not override an earlier statute unless the language of the new law is explicitly contradictory. That is not the case here. Nevertheless, he determined that EPRA applies to the vaccine mandate and issued a preliminary injunction allowing three children to attend school without vaccinations.
Some observations
The opinion of the Raleigh County judge is unusual, to say the least. He seems to be on a mission to create a back-door amendment to the law, although judges are supposed to interpret law not make it. The Legislature, which has the sole authority to make law, has repeatedly refused to create religious exemptions. If EPRA can override every compulsory law on religious grounds, what’s to stop it from overriding compulsory school attendance itself, or even paying taxes?
But political winds are blowing strongly from the right. The governor’s executive order was issued one day after he took office and assumes a muscular, unitary executive power much like that employed by President Trump. The Guzman pleadings in Raleigh County are rife with political innuendo. They call West Virginia a “radical outlier” among states for having no religious exemptions. They claim that West Virginia is trying to align itself with “liberal” states like Connecticut and New York, when in fact those states have moved their law toward ours. No wonder, since West Virginia’s vaccine coverage of schoolchildren is the highest in the nation.
Non-traditional or philosophical beliefs can qualify as religious beliefs if they hold an important place in the person’s life. But even so, EPRA would not protect ornery libertarianism – a belief that the government can’t mandate an individual to do anything. And it would not protect the belief that vaccinations are ineffective or even harmful, ideas promoted by the questionable MAHA views of leading federal health officials.
Yet the exemption procedure ordered by the governor asks no questions. That could vastly expand the number of unvaccinated children who can attend school under a religious exemption, when the underlying objection may not be religious at all. As of October 2025, the Department of Health has granted all 575 religious exemptions requested for the 2025 school year — and denied none. This large number dwarfs the number of medical exemptions granted.
This religious exemption dispute is, in its purest form, the classic struggle between the interests of the whole society and the individual within. It has played out in American history many times. Both sides in the dispute have legitimate points and it will require the Supreme Court of Appeals to sort through them. But it is hard to imagine a purpose more compelling than the protection of the health and safety of schoolchildren. And the vaccine mandate — without religious exemptions –has done an admirable job of that for 120 years.

(Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance)Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has positioned himself as a friend of labor as he seeks the office of governor in 2026, but his past dealings with unions when he headed up the Detroit Medical Center shows he had fraught relationships with workers attempting to organize and seeking equal pay.
Duggan, running now as an independent candidate after being a lifelong Democrat, will undoubtedly need to court labor constituents as much as he’ll need a lift from big business if he wants to pull votes from the inevitable major party nominees next year.
Union support in the Michigan gubernatorial race is a must grab for any candidate, especially Democrats who rely on union campaign infrastructure and independents carving out a slice of the pie. That’s mostly because the labor density is higher in Michigan than most states, said Adrian Hemond, CEO of the bipartisan Grassroots Midwest political consulting firm. Middle-aged and older voters also have witnessed the benefits of union labor and representation in a profound way, affecting the livelihoods of their friends and neighbors, Hemond said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thus far, Duggan has been able to pull some of those unions away from Democratic frontrunner and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, based on his years as mayor and the progress of the city under his watch, which saw few bumps in the road between his administration and the unions that represent the city.
Benson, Duggan duke it out for Teamsters nods in gubernatorial race

But Duggan’s union support in his gubernatorial bid has been met with skepticism from other trade unionists who instead are supporting Benson, and those who said they remember Duggan’s history before his time as mayor.
Among them: Nurses who worked at the medical center and tried to organize a new bargaining unit against pushback from Duggan’s administration; and Teamsters representing medical lab workers, who waged legal battles against   Duggan to equalize pay rates for women and minorities during contract negotiations.
Michigan Advance looked at Duggan’s history with the hospital system, which began in 2004 and ended in 2012. That included reviewing archived news articles and statements from the Michigan Nurses Association, which the Detroit nurses attempted to join. The Advance also interviewed nurses, their advocates and other union members who say Duggan’s efforts blocked   health system nurses from forming a new bargaining unit.
Michigan Advance also attempted to interview Duggan for this story. His campaign did not make him available. 
In a statement to the Advance, campaign spokesperson Andrea Bitely said Duggan has had the overwhelming support of labor in every election he has run, going back to his successful race for Wayne County prosecutor in 2000 and the three mayoral wins, starting in 2013.
“Mike Duggan’s track record with labor is so strong that in 2025, as an independent, he is publicly supported by 12 labor unions — more than all three Democratic candidates combined,” Bitely said. “From carpenters, to police officers, to truck drivers, to EMTs, plumbers and electrical workers, union workers are strongly backing his candidacy.”
Union support tempered by past clashes with hospital nurses
Duggan has garnered union support in his bid for governor, including from Michigan Teamsters Joint Council 43, which represents more than 30,000 workers in the transportation, warehouse, manufacturing and construction sectors, and the Detroit police and fire unions that worked with Duggan as mayor for more than a decade.
Although the Detroit Medical Center allegations were not new, taken together, they paint a picture of Duggan’s early career reluctance to accept or support union activity.
Several former employees or those working with them on the effort told the Advance that Duggan’s administration at the hospital system suppressed organizing activity through surveillance, retaliation, interrogations, banning pro-union literature, and attempts to reclassify nurses as supervisors to disqualify them from the union vote.
The nurses in 2007 said they were primarily concerned about unsafe staffing ratios that affected patient care and the quality of their own work at the Detroit Medical Center. Some reached out to Duggan’s administration in hopes management would address the issue, including now retired nurse Pat Cason-Merenda.

She said Duggan and his administration would not listen to them, so they started making moves to join the Michigan Nurses Association. That led to a wave of anti-union posturing from the hospital system, and complaints to the National Labor Relations Board.
Archived stories in the now-defunct Michigan Citizen, a weekly, Black-owned progressive newspaper in Detroit, reported that nurses testified that employees suspected of organizing were subject to intimidation and disciplinary action, including being written up for handing out organizing materials or interrogated about organizing activity.
Merenda said some nurses leading the drive were brought up on disciplinary charges for what she claimed were insignificant things; solely as an attempt to quell the effort or harass union-curious nurses.
Copies of some of the flyers nurses said the medical center used to deter them  from organizing were also obtained by the Advance. One with a DMC Children’s Hospital of Michigan letterhead asked nurses to “know your facts” about “daily life under a contract.” It warned that last minute requests for time off due to family needs or schedule changes could be compromised, and predicted mandated overtime and seniority job bidding quirks.

Public pressure did not move hospital officials in nurse union fight
Tova Perlmutter, the former executive director of the Detroit-based Sugar Law Center, which focuses on workers’ rights for nonunionized people, confirmed for the Advance that the law center was contacted to help battle those counter measures and put public pressure on Duggan and the medical center to let the nurses organize without interference.
Part of that work involved showing up to the hospital to demand meetings with members of the administration or their board of trustees in hopes they could work out the differences and foster an environment that would help a would-be nurses’ union flourish. They were often denied meetings, Perlmutter said, with hospital administrators, Duggan or board members.
“I remember leaving with a sense of real frustration and that I was seeing how stonewalling could be really effective for corporations in ignoring community demand,” Perlmutter said.
Perlmutter and the Sugar Law Center distributed an open letter, signed by more than 30 Detroit area faith letters, to Duggan and the hospital system’s board asking them to respect the nurses’ wishes to build a union and to sign a fair election agreement. 
Perlmutter also corroborated Merenda’s claim that one of the nurses leading the charge was disciplined and silenced on unrelated workplace conduct allegations, and said that one of the group’s immediate demands was to be present during the disciplinary hearings, but were again denied.
A settlement was finally reached between the Detroit Medical Center and the Michigan Nurses Association in 2008, which gave the nurses the greenlight to begin forming a union. A copy of the settlement, which was not made public, was reviewed by the Advance. The settlement confirmed many of the allegations made by nurses during that time.
Prior to that settlement, the national labor board, in an unrelated ruling, declared that supervising charge nurses could not be considered members of a non-supervisory nurses’ bargaining unit. Perlmutter said that some hospitals around the nation took that as an avenue to make anyone who was eligible to be a charge nurse a supervisor as a way to thin the herd of potential bargaining members.
Marenda said that the medical center employed that strategy as a way to turn the nurses against one another as they sought to organize. The move also prevented the two sides from reaching a fair election agreement in 2007.
Mayoral campaigns denied Duggan employed union-busting tactics 
In 2010, Duggan and the administration were making moves to transform the hospital system from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit operation by selling it to Vanguard Health Systems. Two years later, he resigned from his post at the Detroit Medical Center and was gearing up to run for mayor.
But Duggan’s difficulty with the nurses became a campaign issue, which came to the fore in a 2012 interview on First Shift with Tony Trupiano, a progressive radio talk show. 

https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MallettTrupiano.mp3
 
Conrad Mallet, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court and the current city of Detroit corporation counsel, was one of the DMC’s top administrators during Duggan’s time and later served as his campaign committee chairman. He denied that the medical center had engaged in union-busting tactics while Duggan led the system, and that the organizing effort was not homegrown, but rather imported from California.
The Michigan Nurses Association issued a lengthy news release countering those claims shortly thereafter.
 


It wasn’t just the nurses who had issues with Duggan. Teamsters Local 283 represents the Detroit Medical Center’s lab assistants, and continued to fight against the health system over its contracts after Duggan left. Steve Hicks, president of Teamsters Local 283, said Duggan’s relationship with the local was fraught, especially when it came to equalizing the pay for a Black lab assistant who was making less than her peers.
“People who were African American that worked a long time were making low wages,” Hicks said. “They were hiring white women in for like, $4 and $5 more an hour. We had 200 lab assistants, all of who were making different amounts of money. [Duggan] said he would never equalize the pay.”
Hicks said it took the Teamsters three contracts to eventually do that, but it was not without struggle from Duggan, who again was reluctant to do so.
Those battles with labor during his time at the Detroit Medical Center led labor unions like the UAW, the AFL-CIO and one council of AFSCME workers to support former Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon when he ran against Duggan in 2013 as a write-in candidate.
That included Hicks who told the Advance that he didn’t believe – then or now – that Duggan aligned with basic Democratic Party values that would make party fixtures, especially those in the labor movement, want to vote for him.
John Armelagos, who was the president of the Michigan Nurses Association during Duggan’s time at Detroit Medical Center, said the same.
“I don’t know how any bona fide trade unionist could support Mike Duggan for any office in lieu of the vicious anti-union campaign that was conducted at DMC while he was CEO,” Armelagos said.
Despite the opposition from labor, Duggan ascended to the frontrunner in the race and won. He remained mayor for more than 10 years. In 2017, when he launched his first reelection bid, AFSCME Council 25 issued sweeping support for Duggan, citing him as the best choice to create jobs and opportunities for working people in Detroit.
Lawrence Roehrig, the president of AFSCME Council 25, said then in a statement supporting Duggan that they were excited for another four years of Duggan’s time as mayor. But the split between AFSCME members was palpable. 
In a column by The Detroit News’ Bankole Thompson, Roehrig’s immediate predecessor, Al Garrett, told the newspaper that he would not have endorsed Duggan if he had still been heading up the council, even if it was clear that Duggan would be the most likely winner. Garrett said then he felt that unions were rallying around him for access more than anything, and that he didn’t have his best interests at heart.
The Metro Detroit AFL-CIO rebuffed some of Garrett’s commentary, saying they had seen progress in the city and were ready to support him in his second bid for mayor.
Could past union struggles help Duggan as an independent candidate?
Duggan’s past struggles with unions at the Detroit Medical Center may have an impact on his ability to court additional unions or labor-oriented voters.
Hemond said Duggan will need labor endorsements to signal to Democrats of certain stripes that it is OK to vote for him over whomever is the likely Democratic nominee, which could be Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist or Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.
But Hemond said Duggan only needs a slice of the Michigan union political machine rather than the whole pie.
“We’ve seen in the last couple presidential elections, the last three, really, in this state, that there are a lot of union members that have voted for [President] Donald Trump,” Hemond said. “Those folks have a positive view of their union. They continue to be members. But the Democratic Party has lost them in some other respects, and that’s an important sort of swing constituency in this state.”

Of note, when Trump performed best with those folks, he won Michigan, Hemond added.
Duggan may be reading the room for that sentiment in his own bid, seeing an opportunity with swing-voting unionists who may no longer be buying what the Democrats are selling. Hemond said it would be a mistake for the Democrats in the race, namely Benson, to assume that union members still vote – and endorse – as a monolith.
“That has clearly changed, not just in Michigan, by the way, but it’s more important in Michigan, because there are just more union members and there’s more union history here,” Hemond said. “A UAW member from Macomb County looks a lot different from an MEA member from Alpena County; they look a lot different than a building trades guy from the Sioux. Duggan is trying to take advantage of that and go after what he views as the most gettable labor union members.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Advocates and lawmakers packed a room at the Capitol Wednesday for a listening session hosted by WISDOM, a statewide network of faith-based social justice organizations, to discuss immigration, criminal justice, housing and environmental policy. Participants said they hoped hearing personal stories would move lawmakers beyond “political posturing” and inspire change.
“It’s been almost nine years since I was last charged with anything,” said Jessica Jacobs, a formerly incarcerated woman who was one of the first to speak. “I’ve rebuilt my life, I’ve stayed in recovery, and I’ve dedicated myself to helping others do the same. But my criminal record still follows me, especially when it comes to finding a place to live.” Jacobs said that every time she pays a non-refundable fee only to fail a background check for housing, she’s reminded “that society hasn’t fully forgiven me, even though I’ve done everything I can do to make things right.”
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
When Jacobs was released from prison in 2010, she was placed in a transitional living program. It should have been a second chance, but it wasn’t because that apartment complex was in the very same neighborhood where she would get the substances she used. “It was a setup for failure,” said Jacobs, adding that women and men all over Wisconsin have similar experiences. “Imagine being locked up, and all you can imagine is being with your children again. You count the days dreaming about that reunion. But when you’re finally released, you find out that you can’t get housing that will allow your children to live with you. The pain doesn’t just stop with the mother, the children suffer, too. Families stay separated not because of lack of love or effort, but because there’s nowhere safe and stable for them to go home to.”
Jacobs finally found a landlord who was also in recovery, and could empathize with her situation. “No one’s success story should depend on luck,” she said. “When people don’t have housing, we see the same cycles of recidivism repeat and repeat. Without a place to live, it’s almost impossible to look for a job, maintain recovery, or reunite with your children and family. We say that we want people to come home and be better. But how can they if we won’t give them a place to call home?”
Crystal Keller, a member of the group My Way Out, shared  the struggle incarcerated mothers have in Wisconsin. Keller’s daughter is locked up at the Taycheedah Correctional Institution, where she will be for two years. Keller pointed to a 1991 Wisconsin law that says that incarcerated mothers should be housed with their babies until they turn 12 months old. Yet Keller’s daughter has never been offered access to that program, despite having a two-month-old when she was sentenced. “The program was allocated $198,000 per year,” Keller said. “Where is that money? That’s $6.7 million in the 35 years that they’ve never offered it.” 
Keller said that the Department of Corrections claims to offer the program for women who are out in the community. “That’s a lie,” said Keller. “…when are they going to start complying with the law?” Keller said that when her daughter was sent to Taycheedah, she was placed in restrictive housing for the first six months. “And it took them a month to pick her up from the county jail,” said Keller. “She was not allowed to hold her son for seven months, from two months old until just last month.” Keller’s family would travel from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac just to do hour-long video visits. “Often, visits would get cancelled…Why do I even need to go there?” 
Just last Sunday during a visit, Keller said that another family was told by a correctional officer that they weren’t allowed to even play hand-clapping games with their children. “It’s disgusting, it needs to stop, and DOC who punishes people for breaking the law has been breaking the law for 35 years.” 
Attendees drew attention to other conditions endured by people held in Wisconsin’s prisons and jails. Randy Gage, a member of WISDOM’s Solitary & Conditions of Confinement Task Force, who also has a background in psychology and experience working in prisons in both Georgia and Wisconsin. “Segregation is not the best way to go,” said Gage. “We went through a long period starting around the 1980’s of ‘get tough on crime’. Enough already with getting tough on crime! Enough!” Gage said that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he didn’t have to worry about things like gun violence. “That didn’t happen, and that was before ‘get tough on time’. Since ‘get tough on crime’ all of this is going on? Don’t tell me it works. No, it doesn’t work.” 
Advocates also discussed Act 196, a bipartisan law that favors short-term sanctions for probation and parole violations like a weekend stint in jail, treatment program or community service over total revocation back to prison. “For more than a decade, the DOC has resisted implementing this law that could’ve reduced and stabilized our prison population,” said Tom Gilbert, a member of MOSES. “Finally in June of this year, the DOC issued proposed rules, but they are an extreme disappointment.” Although the proposed rules adopted some features of the law, they do not establish “a system of short-term sanctions,”, said Gilbert, saying that the DOC is choosing to keep a system that “sabotages” people’s chances of returning home rather than promoting healing. “It would save millions of taxpayer dollars spent on needless incarcerations,” said Gilbert. “Those dollars could be re-directed to proven, successful programs such as treatment programs and diversions.” 
Others pushed for restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated people, which is already law in 25 states. Jeremy Dings, a formerly incarcerated member of WISDOM’s Post-Releases Issues Task Force, said that he has not been able to vote in eight election cycles because even though he has been  back in the community for 13 years. Dings said that democracy is strongest when it includes everyone’s voice, and that such a policy change would help people transition and feel like active, valued members of the community.

Restoring drivers licenses for immigrants was also discussed by immigrant rights advocates and dairy farmers. People in mixed-status families take great risk to perform simple tasks like driving to work, or dropping their children off at school, they said. “This is not just about paperwork,”  said Grace Mariscal, a student at St. John’s Northwestern Academies. “This is about parents being able to drive their children to school safely, or go to a doctor’s appointment, without fear.” 
Mariscal said that 19 other states have passed laws that allow members of mixed-status families to have drivers licenses, policies which reduce hit-and-run accidents, increase state revenue, and reduced law enforcement costs. “These reforms would also strengthen Wisconsin’s economies,” said Mariscal. “Our dairy farms, our factories, our restaurants, our food processing plants all depend on immigrant labor. By allowing workers to drive legally, we help businesses maintain stable workforces, and ensure that the industries that feed and sustain our state continue to thrive.”
The rights of nature was also discussed, with advocates pushing for laws that establish personhood for natural habitats, rivers, forests and other ecosystems. “It really comes out of Indigenous values,” said Jim Goodman, a member of Family Farm Defenders. “It is an international movement.” Goodman pointed out that in America, even corporations are given personhood. So why not the ecosystems and natural environments that all things, human or otherwise, depend on? Goodman also advocated for policies to require sulfide mines to prove that they won’t be harmful to the environment before digging begins, and new protections for Devil’s Lake State Park. “Wisconsin has a long history of environmental stewardship”, said Goodman, pointing out that former Wisconsin Gov.  Gaylord Nelson was the founder of Earth Day. 
Advocates also discussed closing the prison in Green Bay, and granting parole to older incarcerated people who were sentenced when they were young. Some in the room condemned Gov. Tony Evers for using his veto power to remove a deadline to close Green Bay Correctional, and pointed to the fact that the Lincoln Hills juvenile prison is still open despite plans to build new prisons to replace the aging and controversial facility. 
Several lawmakers including Reps. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), and new legislators including Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) and Karen DeSanto (D-Baraboo) said  hearing stories like those shared Wednesday are crucial for their work.
“Remember the folks that are not here,” said Madison, who told an emotional story about his brother and friends who struggled with mental illness, suicidal thoughts, and incarceration. “Give your anger to those folks, channel your grief towards those folks, because it’s a damn shame that they’re not here.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3804-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 06:56:41.911236

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state lawmakers in charge of writing the state’s budget questioned Gov. Jared Polis’ proposal to fund Medicaid less than its projected growth over the upcoming fiscal year.
“The Medicaid cuts here are particularly large. Given the scope of Medicaid in our budget, it’s not an unreasonable approach,” Sen. Jeff Brides, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said during Polis’ presentation of his budget proposal to the Joint Budget Committee on Wednesday. “It is concerning to see, and I want to know what you’ve done to ensure that these reductions are targeted and minimize impact on accessibility in the state.”
Polis said he does not characterize his plan as cutting Medicaid, but as a reduction in how fast the program for low-income Coloradans grows. The program is projected to grow nearly 12% next fiscal year, which begins in July, which would require a budget increase of about $630 million. Instead, he wants the Legislature to approve a budget that would only allow Medicaid spending to grow by about $300 million.

“This isn’t a trim,” said Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican. “It’s a blow to families who are already fighting to get care. These numbers represent real people.”
Medicaid is responsible for more and more of the budget each year, now up to about one-third. The state’s spending power is constrained by the growth of inflation and population due to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, so ballooning Medicaid costs have forced budget writers to cut other program spending.
“We want any item that grows faster than other items to be one you look at with a magnifying glass and demand better outcomes and better results,” Polis said.
Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat, suggested that the state needs to take steps to rightsize Medicaid utilization, so clients are getting care “at the right place, at the right time and at the right level of care.” Medicaid costs are determined by utilization and provider rates, and Polis recently signed an executive order to reverse a provider rate increase to address a budget shortfall.
“What we end up doing, for the most part, is not actually attacking utilization, but attacking the rates at which we pay providers,” Brown said.
Polis and Mark Ferrandino, the director of the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting, said an anticipated analysis on Colorado’s Medicaid program from a third-party firm will give insight into how the state compares nationally and what policy changes could be helpful long-term.
The Joint Budget Committee is in charge of writing the state’s annual budget, which is constitutionally required to be balanced. The governor submits an initial proposal in November and another in January. The Legislature typically debates and votes on the budget in March.
The state is also preparing to implement new Medicaid eligibility work requirements by 2027, which Ferrandino said could cost upwards of $5 million.
“That could get us a good start to get it implemented, but we are waiting on (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to give us that guidance,” he said. “That could change significantly what the requirements would be.”

(Photo of Martin Administrative Building, City of Martin Facebook)The Weakley County Grand Jury on Monday indicted Martin, Tenn. Mayor Randal “Randy” Brundige and two other city officials, one of them the mayor’s daughter, for using public funds for travel, meals and, in one case, to funnel money into a personal consulting firm.
Investigators for the Tennessee Comptroller’s Office found Randy Brundige and Bradley “Brad” Thompson, director of Economic and Community Development, used a city-issued credit card at high-end restaurants for meals and alcohol while traveling on city business, once spending $673 on a meal for the pair in 2021. 
The approved state rate for meal reimbursement at the time was $61 per day.
Comptroller’s investigators reviewed documents over a 10-year period from Feb. 1, 2015 to June 13, 2025 and accused Mayor Brundige of misappropriating at least $10,900.

Thompson, who owns a firm called One Consulting, billed the city for grant-writing and administrative services performed by the firm that were already part of his official duties. According to a Comptroller’s report, Thompson misappropriated $274,000 via One Consulting. Brundige approved all payments to One Consulting without a contract between the firm and the city.
Thompson also used a city credit card for luxury travel, including a trip to Italy.
“This case is troubling because it involves a sitting mayor and a senior city official,” said Comptroller Jason Mumpower. “City officials must ensure strong internal controls are in place to protect public funds including monitoring credit card use, enforcing travel policies, and reviewing employee timesheets.”
Randy Brundige’s daughter, Natalie Brundige, who was custodian for the Martin Police Department, where her duties were described as sweeping, mopping, dusting and emptying trash cans, earned $174,000 in salary, leave, and benefits. Evidence showed she routinely worked only about two hours of her scheduled eight-hour shifts over a six-year period. 
Randy Brundige was indicted on four counts of theft of property over $60,000, one count of accessory after the fact, one count of theft of property over $10,000, and four counts of official misconduct. Thompson was indicted on one count of theft of property over $60,000, four counts of official misconduct, and one count of theft of property over $10,000.
The grand jury indicted Natalie Brundige on one count of theft of property over $60,000 and one count of official misconduct.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Mike Simpson is one of Rhode Island’s biggest cheerleaders for hemp cultivation and the plant’s derivative products — remedies, he believes, that may help where pharmaceutical medicines cannot. 
It’s that very reason Simpson helped co-found Rhode Island’s only outdoor hemp farm, where he says many of the business’ products ship all across the country.
But Lovewell Farms’ may cease operations now that Congress has approved reopening the federal government under legislation that would effectively ban hemp products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC. If approved by President Donald Trump, the ban will go into effect in a year. 

“This might be the final straw,” Simpson said in an interview Wednesday. “I may have to shut my whole company down.” 
Simpson doesn’t sell intoxicating products, but said crops grown at his Hopkinton farm can contain up to 1 milligram of THC in it, as is allowed under existing Rhode Island hemp regulations.
“I have 700 to 800 pounds of flower that I grew this year that under that law would not be legal,” he said.
Simpson said he would grow crops with lower concentrations, but as a USDA-certified organic farm, there aren’t that many seed suppliers he can buy from.
“We’re really at the whim of what those folks are providing,” he said.
The provision in the shutdown-ending appropriations bill was championed by GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in order to close a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp but inadvertently paved the way for the proliferation of hemp-derived THC products like infused drinks — products which states have since scrambled to either regulate or ban.
THC drinks derived from hemp were illegal in Rhode Island until August 2024, when the state’s now-defunct Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, including vape shops and liquor stores.
The presence of hemp-derived drinks has led to a debate on whether such drinks should even be legal in Rhode Island. Members of the state’s recreational cannabis industry for the most part have been against allowing THC products to be sold outside licensed pot shops. 
Since the start of the fiscal year on July 1, regulators in the newly-established Rhode Island Cannabis Office have crafted recommendations on dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing conditions, and other ways to ensure children don’t accidentally consume the intoxicating drinks. 
Cannabis Control Commission spokesperson Charon Rose said the regulators are aware of recent federal developments concerning hemp and hemp-derived products and are monitoring the situation. 
“At this time, it is too soon to determine what impact these developments may have on Rhode Island,” she said in an email. “We remain committed to keeping stakeholders and the public informed as more information becomes available.”
But Nicholas Fede Jr., executive director for the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative, warns the ban could cause major disruptions in the growing beverage market. That will especially be the case should the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice decline to reclassify cannabis at the federal level. The feds still consider marijuana a Schedule I drug, meaning it’s subject to the strictest federal controls, which limit interstate distribution. 
“That would upend how it comes to market in our state,” Fede said in an interview. “All of a sudden we couldn’t take credit cards for these items, we would have separate bank accounts.”
Fede said the best path forward is to establish clear regulations for hemp-infused drinks while allowing liquor stores to continue selling them.

“We’ve proven for 100 years we can regulate intoxicating products very well,” he said.
A “nefarious misinterpretation”
Kentucky’s other Republican U.S. senator, Rand Paul, attempted to strip the last-minute hemp language from the federal funding bill through an amendment on Monday, but his effort failed on a 76-24 vote. 
Rhode Island’s Democratic Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse voted in favor of McConnell’s restrictions, though their offices noted the senators ultimately opposed the final budget bill.
“At the urging of the vast majority of the state attorneys general, they voted to table an amendment to strip this provision,” their offices said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current.
They were referring to a letter sent to key members of Congress in October by 39 attorneys general, including Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, in which they urged lawmakers to close the THC loophole.
“Industry actors have nefariously misinterpreted the Farm Bill’s legalization of low concentrations of hemp-derived delta-9,” the AGs wrote. “These products are being sold nationwide without consistent age restrictions, labeling standards, or safety requirements and are frequently packaged as gummies, candies, and beverages designed to appeal to young children.”
By itself, hemp produces little to no THC, the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication, and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested, unlike other cannabis plants.
But its potency can be increased by chemistry. Methods include soaking the hemp material in a liquid like butane or ethanol, applying enough pressure and heat to extract delta-8 or delta-9 THC compounds, or exposing the plant to acid.
“This is not natural,” Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, said in an interview. “You cannot trust anything you buy in a shop right now.”
Which is why Procter said he’s in favor of banning psychoactive hemp products until there are firmer regulations and standards for products.
“The hemp bill was never designed to allow hemp-derived delta-9 THC to be sold on the open market,” he said.
But Simpson’s interpretation of the 2018 bill is that any rules surrounding new hemp products are up to the states, which he said Rhode Island did to ensure safer products.
“We have consumable licensing, products have to go through testing, display THC amounts,” he said. “If we want a free market economy, and this is open and available, we shouldn’t be penalizing or punishing the businesses.”

Years after the prolonged fight over the Colorado Department of Transportation’s widening of Interstate 70, CDOT is now proposing to widen Interstate 270.
Coloradans learned painfully from I-70: projects that expand highways in historically burdened neighborhoods don’t heal communities, they compound harm. But, apparently, CDOT did not learn from its past mistakes.
The most immediate concern is timing: the planned 60-day comment period for the project’s environmental review process — which begins Nov. 17 — falls over Thanksgiving, Hannukah, Christmas, the New Year, and other end-of-year holidays. CDOT has denied requests by GreenLatinos and other groups to delay this comment period, choosing to bulldoze ahead and force community members to defend their health and well-being during one of the busiest times of year. This decision reflects CDOT’s philosophy that community input is an afterthought. CDOT must delay the comment period, or it will further erode public trust and faith in our government.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Timing aside, widening I-270 is a bad idea. For more than a decade GreenLatinos and the residents of North Denver and Commerce City have been raising our voices for cleaner air and healthier neighborhoods. We’ve documented how highway traffic — especially in conjunction with nearby industrial facilities like the Suncor refinery — concentrates pollution in front-line communities, and we’ve pushed for transportation solutions that prioritize health, not mere vehicle throughput. As GreenLatinos’ community work and reports make clear, widening a highway that slices through these neighborhoods will only worsen the pollution burden that residents already shoulder.
That pollution burden matters. Asthma, cardiovascular disease, and other pollution-related illnesses are not abstract statistics for North Denver and Commerce City — they are daily realities. The settlement reached over I-70 included commitments to health studies and air monitoring because the I-70 expansion exposed gaps in how transportation impacts on community health were assessed and mitigated. If CDOT wished to put health first, it would shift away from road widening and toward strategies that reduce vehicle miles traveled, invest in clean transit, and protect the people who live closest to the freeway.
Colorado also has concrete climate goals that highway widening would directly undercut. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and planners and advocates have repeatedly pointed out that adding lanes inevitably induces demand — more driving, more emissions, and more pollution dumped into vulnerable neighborhoods. Induced demand also means that adding a lane will not help with congestion. We cannot credibly meet 2030 and 2050 targets while building capacity that invites more tailpipe pollution. Policy and infrastructure must instead pull in the opposite direction, toward climate solutions.
There’s another practical problem with CDOT’s plans for I-270: cost. Colorado is facing significant budget pressures — from state revenue hits tied to federal changes to ongoing deficits — and yet CDOT is discussing multi-hundred-million-dollar to billion-dollar projects that lock in maintenance and environmental costs for decades. In a moment when state resources are scarce, we should be asking whether this is the highest and best use of public dollars. Investments in electrified transit, community health protection, and targeted industrial enforcement would deliver far greater returns for Coloradans.
Remember why Colorado created the Office of Environmental Justice and strengthened environmental justice processes in CDOT and state agencies: to prevent precisely this kind of proposal from steamrolling through without adequately protecting front-line communities. Those reforms came about because residents and organizations fought to make them real after the harms of past projects. If Colorado’s environmental justice commitments are meaningful, they must be more than checkbox language.  They should be a veto against proposals that increase pollution exposure and displacement risk for disproportionately burdened communities.
What comes next if we continue down this path? If CDOT’s core philosophy remains focused on moving cars rather than making people healthier, we will be replaying the same fights we saw with I-70: more lawsuits and more broken trust. But the state has tools to change course.  Rather than widening highways, it can and should prioritize zero-emission transit, congestion-fighting tools like differential tolling, and community-led health and safety improvements like green space and bike paths. Communities have been clear about what they need, and CDOT should listen.
CDOT’s mandate is to connect Colorado. That cannot mean sacrificing the health and futures of low-income and Latino communities to (in theory) save a few extra minutes of drive time. It must mean an approach that centers environmental justice, aligns with climate goals, protects public dollars, and restores trust in our government. And that starts with delaying the planned comment period to allow for adequate community engagement and meaningful consideration of alternatives.
If we’re serious about justice and climate, CDOT should be widening the path to a healthier, more equitable future — not I-270.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by by David Stephenson)Our representative democracy rests on a fundamental principle: We, the people, have a right to participate in decisions that affect us. 
In two prior reports, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky described how Kentucky’s General Assembly, in its 60-day legislative sessions, has increasingly fast-tracked legislation in ways that weaken that principle. 
In our newest report, “How Can They Do That? 2025 Challenges to Transparency and Citizen Participation in Kentucky’s Legislative Process,” we show that fast-tracking also occurred in 30-day legislative sessions. These fast-track maneuvers are often combined with other undemocratic tactics to create a negative, compounding effect on public participation. It is not uncommon for a bill to follow a process like this:

A “shell bill” is filed with a vague title and little or no substantive language, creating the opportunity for substantial changes to be inserted at the last minute.
The bill is given “readings” on the chamber floor before the committee discusses the bill. The public may not notice that this has happened, but the maneuver creates the opportunity to rush the bill to a floor vote after the committee approves it. 
The committee calls a meeting outside its regularly scheduled meeting time to consider the bill, with short notice to the public that it is meeting at a different time.
At the committee hearing, the original bill is replaced with a substitute version that the public has not seen and cannot access prior to the committee discussion. 
The committee approves the substitute bill and sends it to the full House or Senate for a vote that very day, allowing the public only a couple of hours to contact their legislators about the bill. 
No minutes of the committee meeting are posted, leaving no public record of committee discussions and public testimony on the bill.

Senate Bill 202, passed in the 2025 session, was one of many bills that used these tactics. The bill was introduced as a five-page shell bill filed on the bill filing deadline. It made two minor wording changes to existing law: changing e-mail to email and Web site to website. In its final form, the bill expanded to 28 pages that added new rules on a substantive issue (the distribution and sale of cannabis-infused beverages). These changes were accomplished by pulling the bill for floor readings before committees discussed the bill, then introducing substitute versions of the bill and moving it to floor votes within 24 hours. No minutes of these committee meetings were posted, leaving no record of committee discussion or public testimony. This process left little time for those affected by the new language to understand and give input on the bill.
As in our prior reports, the 2025 report recommends to the General Assembly specific ways to give the people time to understand and give input on bills before voting on them. Those recommendations include posting draft legislation before each session, limiting the use of shell bills, allowing time for the public to review changes made to bills before a vote is taken, transacting most committee business during regularly scheduled meetings, and posting timely records of legislative proceedings.  
The League of Women Voters of Kentucky supports informed and active citizen participation in government. We remind our elected officials that they work for the people, were elected to represent the people, and must give the people opportunities to understand and give input on legislation that affects us.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)More than 400 Arkansans entered the 2026 election cycle by Wednesday’s filing deadline, several of them returning candidates and some setting up rematches from the 2024 elections.
In addition to the regularly scheduled November 2026 elections, in which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton will each seek another term, some Central Arkansas and River Valley voters will head to the polls for a special election earlier in the year.
For now, the House District 70 and Senate District 26 special elections are scheduled for June 9, 2026. Voters in both districts are suing to move the elections forward in hopes of having representation during the April 2026 legislative fiscal session, where funding for a proposed state prison will be up for debate.
Both seats became vacant in September after Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch died and Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock resigned.
Five Republicans are vying for their party’s nomination to succeed Stubblefield: former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark, Wade Dunn and Stacie Smith of Greenwood, and Brad Simon and Ted Tritt of Paris.

Stubblefield’s family has endorsed Dunn, who told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette he will “tirelessly” continue Stubblefield’s opposition to Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. Smith, Tritt and Simon have also said they oppose the prison plan.
Adam Watson of Branch, one of the prison’s most vocal opponents, also filed to run for the Senate seat. As an independent, he will forgo the primary and automatically advance to the general election.
District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
In Pulaski County’s House District 70, Wing’s 2024 Democratic opponent has filed to run for the seat again. Alex Holladay of North Little Rock will face Cordelia Smith-Johnson of Sherwood in the primary. Bo Renshaw of North Little Rock is the only Republican running for the seat.
Last week, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters asked a judge to hold Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order to set the district’s special election for March 3.
In October, another judge ordered the state to hold the Senate District 26 election “as soon as practicable.” The state has appealed the order.
For the regularly scheduled elections, the primary election for partisan races and the general election for nonpartisan judicial races will be March 3, 2026.
The general election for partisan races is Nov. 3. Runoff contests for the general election, if necessary, will be Dec. 1. Judicial runoffs will be on Nov. 3 if necessary.

 Rematches

The Democratic Party of Arkansas is fielding 75 candidates across legislative, executive and congressional races in 2026. Fewer contested races were on the ballot in 2024, when the party fielded 72 candidates.
Several Democrats running for Republican-held legislative seats have run before.
Democrat Dexter Miller of Helena-West Helena has challenged incumbent Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, in the Delta’s House District 62 twice. McElroy defeated Miller by 197 votes in 2022 and by 663 votes in 2024.
Miller filed on Monday to run for the seat for a third time. Unlike the previous two elections, he won’t face a primary opponent. McElroy filed last week to run for a sixth term.
Additionally, Democrat Rey Hernandez of Rogers filed Wednesday to run for a third time against Rep. Rebecca Burkes, R-Lowell. Hernandez said last year that he hadn’t initially planned to challenge Burkes in 2024 but changed his mind when no other Democrat had entered the race.
Four other House Republicans will face rematches with their 2024 Democratic opponents in the general election:

Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville will face Doug Corbitt of Conway
Rep. Matt Brown will face Cynthia Nations, both of Conway
Rep. Karilyn Brown of Sherwood will face Andrew Cade Eberly of Jacksonville
Rep. Cindy Crawford will face Jane-Ellen Udouj-Kutchka, both of Fort Smith

Alexander City Councilwoman Gina Thomas-Littlejohn will again face Rep. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant, in the House District 81 general election if she defeats Elijah Zane Thompson of Bryant in the Democratic primary.
 Contested primaries

Other returning candidates from both parties will not be facing their previous opponents.
Democrat Ryan Intchauspe of Rudy will run again for House District 24. He lost to Rep. Brad Hall, R-Rudy, last year in their effort to succeed Van Buren Republican Rep. Charlene Fite, who did not run for reelection.
Hall filed Nov. 4 to defend his seat but notified state officials Tuesday that he withdrew from the race, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. His decision came after the Democrat-Gazette reported that his wife accused him of abusive behavior in their ongoing divorce proceedings.
Fite filed to run for her former seat Nov. 5. She will face Melissa Koller of Alma in the Republican primary.
Democrat Cassandra Mayes (formerly Green) unsuccessfully sought Republican Rep. Brandon Achor’s seat in Maumelle’s House District 71 last year. Next year she will face Republican Stephen Bright, who represented Maumelle in the House from 2003 to 2011.
Achor is running for the Senate District 13 seat and will face former Department of Human Services administrator Mischa Martin of Sherwood in the GOP primary.
Allison Grigsby Sweatman, a North Little Rock social worker and former Young Democrats of Arkansas president, is again running for Senate District 13. She lost to incumbent Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, in 2022.

English is ineligible to run again due to term limits. Sweatman will face Jason Williams of Sherwood in the Democratic primary to succeed her.
Meanwhile in the Delta, Robert Thorne Jr. of Marion is the sole Republican candidate for House District 35. He lost the 2024 election by 120 votes to Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, who is now running for an open Senate seat.
Five people filed to run in the House District 35 Democratic primary, including Sherry Holliman of Marion and Demetris Johnson of Earle. Both lost the 2024 Democratic primary to McGruder. They will face Joyce Ann Gray, Willie Williams and Audrey Willis in next year’s primary.
Another crowded primary race will be in the River Valley’s House District 46, where Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, has reached his term limit. Paris City Councilwoman Tonya Fletcher, Brian Cooper of Booneville, Curtis Varnell of Subiaco and Ronni Tate Young of Charleston are all running in the Republican primary.
Tritt and Simon, the Senate District 26 candidates, originally planned to run for House District 46 before the death of Stubblefield, who won reelection to a four-year term last year.
Two North Arkansas House districts will also see contested Republican primaries in light of their incumbent lawmakers not running for reelection.
Mike Bishop, Jon Burnside, Truman Copeland, Jeff Pratt and Boone County Justice of the Peace Kyle Evatt, all of Harrison, will seek the GOP nomination to succeed outgoing Rep. Ron McNair, R-Alpena, of House District 5.
In neighboring House District 6, Republicans Steven Baird, Cody Rogers and Carroll County Justice of the Peace Hunter Rivett are running to succeed outgoing Rep. Harlan Breaux, R-Holiday Island.
Four Republicans are vying for the House District 52 Republican nomination: Mike Jones, Dardanell City Councilwoman Crystal Malloy, Kristain Thompson and Yell County Justice of the Peace Brent Montgomery. Rep. Marcus Richmond, R-Harvey, is not running for reelection.

Former Republican Rep. Dawn Creekmore of East End, will face two primary opponents, Casey Reed and Eric Shepherd of Sheridan, in a bid to succeed outgoing Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, in House District 92.
In House District 88, Rep. Dolly Henley of Washington faces a Republican primary challenge from Lonny Mack Goodwin of Saratoga. Goodwin unsuccessfully ran as a Libertarian for a Senate seat in 2024. His wife, Tammy Goodwin, was Henley’s 2024 general election opponent, also as a Libertarian.
Coty Powers of Walnut Ridge is again running for House District 30, in which he lost the 2024 GOP primary to incumbent Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, also of Walnut Ridge. Cavenaugh is not running for another term and has endorsed Powers’ 2026 primary opponent, Josh Longmire, a Craighead County justice of the peace from Jonesboro.
No Democrats filed to run in House Districts 5, 6, 30, 46, 52, 88 or 92.
Also in Northeast Arkansas, Erika Askeland filed Wednesday to run as a Democrat for House District 32, held by Jonesboro Republican Rep. Jack Ladyman, who is running for a sixth term. Askeland unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, in 2024. She will face Josh Alfano in the 2026 Democratic primary.
 Gubernatorial and congressional contests

Sanders will not face a primary opponent on her path to a second and final term as governor. Two Democrats seek to challenge Sanders: State Sen. Fred Love of Mabelvale and Supha Xayprasith-Mays of Bentonville.

Sen. Tom Cotton is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate. He will face Micah Ashby of Bradford and Jeb Little of Harrison in the GOP primary.
Hallie Shoffner, a farmer from Newport who lives in Little Rock, and Lewisville Mayor Ethan Dunbar will compete for the Democratic nomination to run for Cotton’s seat.
All four Republicans who represent Arkansas in the U.S. House are running for reelection, and all four will face Democratic opponents:

Terri Yarbrough Green is challenging eight-term U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford in the 1st District, which covers North Arkansas, Northeast Arkansas and the Delta
Zack Huffman and former gubernatorial candidate Chris Jones will run in the Democratic primary for the 2nd District in Central Arkansas, seeking to challenge five-term U.S. Rep. French Hill
Robb Ryerse seeks to challenge eight-term U.S. Rep. Steve Womack in the 3rd District
Steven O’Donnell and James Russell III will run in the Democratic primary to challenge five-term U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman in the 4th District

Russell announced in August that he would run in the U.S. Senate primary but said in October that he would run for the 4th District instead.
Hill will be the only sitting Congressman with a primary opponent, Chase McDowell.
All Arkansas voters will see two nonpartisan state Supreme Court races on the 2026 ballot. Associate Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni will run for each other’s positions since their appointments by Sanders make them ineligible to defend their own seats.
Bronni is running unopposed, and Hiland will face Little Rock attorney John Adams, who represented 18 plaintiffs challenging a 2023 state law that would have criminalized the availability of “obscene” library content and did not provide a clear definition of the term. A federal judge blocked the challenged sections of the law, and the state has appealed the ruling.

State probe into Black communities’ displacement surges forward with infusion of funds

Virginia’s examination of its buried history of university expansion into Black neighborhoods is entering new territory — one that may test how well research efforts translate to accountability.
A legislative commission in Richmond has spent the past year surveying nearly every public institution of higher education, finding that at least 11cited using eminent domain or other means to acquire land in majority-Black neighborhoods. At the same time, a city–university task force in Newport News is documenting the local impact of one such case involving Christopher Newport University (CNU), sharing new details about its research into the erasure of a historic Black community. 
Together, the statewide study and local inquiry illustrate how Virginia’s reckoning over displacement may unfold. At minimum, both have begun to make records and acknowledgment of these histories more public.
 Early findings

The Newport News task force — formed nearly two years ago by Mayor Phillip Jones and CNU President William Kelly — held its first public forum earlier this month. Co-chairs Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany III and CNU Provost Quentin Kidd, along with four other members, outlined progress documenting property acquisitions and interviewing impacted families.
According to their presentation, researchers have identified about 130 properties tied to the university’s expansion since the 1960s and are compiling those records into a public digital map that will be housed on the Newport News Public Library’s website.
Councilman Marcellus Harris III, who grew up in the displaced neighborhood, is helping lead interviews. Harris noted eight had been completed so far, with up to 15 more planned. Members expect to release a final report in the second half of 2026, with another public meeting planned to present recommendations.

The presentation was the task force’s most detailed update to date. Previous news releases on the university’s website offered only broad language about research and outreach to the dismay of some families, local citizens, and advocates who have been urging the group to be more open with its process.
In their first on-camera, sit-down interview with the Virginia Mercury in early November, Bethany and Kidd said the cautious pace reflects a desire to ensure accuracy before releasing information publicly.
“We needed to get to a point with the actual facts so that we could provide an update that was meaningful,” Kidd said.
Task force members said much of their work has focused on understanding the scope of displacement and how best to document it. They also described that lengthy process as key to fully understanding both the history and its impact.
“Our task force refuses to issue recommendations that are performative and carry no teeth, because we know that would deepen distrust,” said member and City Councilman Cleon Long during the presentation. “We do not want to send proposed recommendations that are dead on arrival.”
The work represents uncharted territory for the group.
“There is no blueprint,” Bethany said. “We’re learning as we go.”

 Homeowners seek clarity, concrete outcomes

Long before the public meeting, the task force  faced calls for greater transparency about the makeup of the task force and why its meetings were closed. 
Citizens raised concerns at several council meetings and community events about the lack of public access to the task force’s meetings. Letters to Mayor Phillip Jones and CNU President William Kelly urged appointing descendants or expanding citizen participation, while correspondence to the task force itself sought clearer details about its purpose.
The co-chairs said their approach — prioritizing research before engagement — was meant to build credibility, and said they remain confident in that decision despite public criticism.
“At the end of the day, you have to be confident in the work you did,” Kidd said.

Roughly 40 to 50 people attended the presentation, including current and former residents, CNU faculty and community members. Questions were collected during three separate small-group breakout discussions facilitated by the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities. Participants said conversations centered on transparency, university expansion plans and potential forms of repair.
Melvin Byrd, who grew up on Prince Drew Road, said he would like to see the website include more transparency about how the remaining property acquisitions occurred. 
“The college’s original charter was not supposed to expand beyond (that) boundary line,” he said. “They did, and the methods by which they obtained that land may or may not have been above board.”
During his session, he said two attendees suggested the university establish a fund or set-aside for descendants of displaced families. Byrd also said he hoped to see the task force make more of its property data publicly accessible.
Homeowners who still live in the neighborhood expressed desire for tangible outcomes. 
“I know the history,” said Katie Luck, one of the five remaining residents. “Now I want to know Christopher Newport’s plans for our community. I’m just not getting any answers.”
The lack of answers has kept her from improving her property, Luck said. 
“I had great plans for my home, but because of what’s been going on, we haven’t done anything to it except paint the shutters, put on a new roof, and screen the porch. That’s it.”

Gail Guynn, who lives in one of the five remaining homes in the community, expressed similar sentiments.  
“They’ve shared their research more publicly,” she said, “but what matters more to me is how honestly they’ll talk about the harmful decisions that were made, who made them, and how those decision makers will be held accountable.” Local pastors Andrew Millard and William Blackwell Jr., who have been vocal critics of the task force’s transparency over the past year, said the update was encouraging but overdue. 
“We weren’t looking for results a year ago,” Millard said. “We just wanted to know what they were doing.”
Millard said it was helpful to hear the task force is interviewing displaced families but still believes descendants should be directly represented on it. He also urged the university to be forthright about its future development.

 “One thing the university needs to do is be honest about its future expansion plans — whether that 2030 plan is still on the books or not,” he said, referring to a previously reported university site plan that called for acquiring the remaining houses in the neighborhood by that time.
Blackwell said the task force’s November update was a sign of progress but urged the group to improve its communication – suggesting the website as a tool for more consistent updates  
“Providing even brief highlights when full details aren’t available would help keep everyone informed and foster greater transparency,” Blackwell said.
He also emphasized the importance of direct engagement with affected families. “A decision has to be made one way or another,” he said. “Are we going to do reparations, a plaque, something to recognize the group? That should come from the people who were impacted — but if you don’t talk to them, then you’re doing it in a silo.”
While the task force did not outline a formal framework, its recent updates offered some indication of the guiding principles shaping its approach to recommendations. Members have expressed a desire to be intentional in their work and ensure it honors the community. At the November meeting, they also sought to distance themselves from the practical implementation of proposed recommendations – emphasizing the group “lacks the authority” to enact measures and operates separately from the city and university offices that could ultimately make those decisions.
At the same time, several members hold influential positions within those very institutions. Bethany and Long serve on the Newport News City Council, while Kidd and Vidal Dickerson, another task force member, hold executive-level roles at Christopher Newport University.
 The path forward

Looking ahead, the local task force members said insights from the November meeting will guide the next phase of the group’s work. Updates on the task force’s progress could drop soon after the state commission’s current deadline to complete its work. 
The commission’s research subcommittee is working to verify universities’ survey responses using public data and records and is seeking to hire a project coordinator to support that effort. Lawmakers approved additional funding earlier this year, bolstering the commission’s continued operation through mid-2026.
The commission’s survey responses could signal growing university collaboration in helping the legislative group document displacement histories. Of the 11 institutions that acknowledged using eminent domain or acquiring property in majority-Black neighborhoods, universities including Christopher Newport, Longwood, Old Dominion, Radford, Virginia Commonwealth, and the Virginia Military Institute confirmed such activity. Respondents also outlined the types of records available to support that history, ranging from real estate transactions and property assessments to letters and newspaper clippings related to land purchases.

In Newport News, Bethany and Kidd declined to elaborate on the outlook of the group’s final recommendations, saying they are not far enough along in their research to determine that. They did say they hope any eventual outcomes reflect the intent behind their work.
“I wouldn’t feel good if we produced a report and made recommendations that weren’t actionable,” Kidd said. “And I wouldn’t feel good if we made recommendations that were so narrowly actionable that they didn’t really seem like much.”
Bethany added that he hopes the process ultimately strengthens trust between the task force and the community and that it “feels confident in the work we’ve been able to accomplish.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)The small town of Damascus in Southwest Virginia has been eagerly rebuilding after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage in September 2024. Despite their efforts, business was still significantly down for the town on the one-year anniversary of the storm, largely because the most popular part of the Virginia Creeper Trail — the town’s chief recreational attraction — was washed away. Now, the community is taking the first steps to bringing it back.
In Damascus, business is down but hopes are high one year after Hurricane Helene

The contract to rebuild the biking trail from Whitetop to Damascus has been awarded to Omaha-based Kiewit Corporation and is worth over $240 million. The company will use crews out of Peachtree, Georgia that are expected to arrive in town in the next week to start work.
“The Virginia Creeper Trail is the lifeline of our precious little Town,” said Mayor Katie Lamb. “Damascus, the heart of the Creeper Trail, is thrilled to welcome the Kiewit team. We are beyond excited for the rebuilding of the trail and the economic impact this will bring back to Southwest Virginia.”
The small town of Damascus, which boasts a population of 747 people, is a destination for outdoor enthusiasts who meet on the Appalachian trail and bike or hike the Creeper Trail, among dozens of other attractions.
The lion’s share of the economy for Damascus, dubbed “Trail Town USA,” is supported by the cyclists who take the Creeper Trail’s scenic route down from Whitetop and cruise into Damascus. It being mostly downhill makes it more accessible for all ages to ride and the mostly forested area provides shade and spectacular mountain views.
With that portion of the trail totally washed out for over a year, businesses said they were down as much as 75% during what was supposed to be their peak season in September. The U.S. Forest Service has removed 30,000 cubic yards of debris in order for the construction company to get in to replace miles of trail and 30 trestle bridges.
Local businesses have urged the public to come ride the less popular portion of the trail that stretches from Damascus to Abingdon. It is not fully downhill like the Whitetop portion, which can make it more difficult for some ability levels.
The town is hopeful that with the influx of contractors coming to town to work on the trail, the town will see some economic benefits. During the Hurricane Helene anniversary commemoration event, Town Manager Chris Bell said they hope to work out ways for the contractor to utilize local shuttles and other businesses.
“We have been proactively working with local businesses and property owners to prepare for this influx of contractors and temporary economic boost over the next year,” Bell said.
The construction is anticipated to be completed in the fall of 2026.

Ohio Senate Bill 50 recently passed the Ohio House after the Ohio Senate passed the bill in April with a party line vote. 
DeWine has not received the bill as of Wednesday morning, his spokesperson Dan Tierney said. 
Once DeWine gets the bill, he will have 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it. If he vetoes the bill, lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override it.

Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. during the school year on school nights.
However, Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
Ohio lawmakers also recently passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teen has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
Ohio Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced both Senate Bill 50 and the Senate Resolution earlier this year, which says 14 and 15 year olds would need approval from a parent or guardian to work till 9 p.m.
“Give 14 and 15 year olds another opportunity to stay an extra hour to work at a grocery store bagging groceries or even to make an extra buck,” Ohio state Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Chillicothe, said during a recent Ohio House session. “I find that there’s not a thing wrong with learning how to work at a young age.” 
Johnson shared how he delivered newspapers and worked on a vegetable farm when he was growing up. He said he got a job working at Waffle House his senior year of high school and became the assistant manager before he was 19. 
“I learned how to work and be productive at a young age,” he said. “None of that hurt me one bit.”
State Rep. Lauren McNally, D-Youngstown, was shocked her fellow lawmakers were in favor of passing the bill. 
“How dare we pretend that putting 14 year olds on late-night shifts, in dangerous workplaces, is somehow helping families.” she said. “It’s not helping anyone. It’s exploitation, plain and simple.”
She argued teenagers can not fill Ohio’s most in-demand jobs, which include nurses, home health aides, and truck drivers. 
“It’s not about filling workforce gaps,” McNally said. “It’s about filling corporate pockets. … The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was our promise to America’s children: You deserve a childhood. You deserve an education. You deserve safety. Now you want to tear that promise apart for profit.”
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.  
“We’ve created a system where families are forced to rely on their kid’s wages just to survive, and instead of fixing that by paying adults a living wage by supporting affordable child care, we’re about to hand corporations a new generation of underpaid, overworked, under-protected employees, and shame on us if we let that happen,” McNally said. 
Ohio House Democrats Chris Glassburn and Daniel Troy voted for the bill and the Senate Resolution, while Ohio House Republicans Jason Stephens and Scott Oelslager voted against them both. 
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance spoke in favor of the bill earlier this year during committee while the Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio opposes the bill.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)When six Southern public university systems this summer formed a new accreditation agency, the move shook the national evaluation model that higher education has relied on for decades.
The news wasn’t unexpected: It arrived a few months after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in April overhauling the nation’s accreditation system by, among other things, barring accreditors from using college diversity mandates. It also came after U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in May made it easier for universities to switch accreditors.
The accreditation process, often bureaucratic, cumbersome and time consuming, is critical to the survival of institutions of higher education. Colleges and their individual departments must undergo outside reviews — usually every few years — to prove that they meet certain educational and financial standards. If a school is not accredited, its students cannot receive federal aid such as Pell grants and student loans.
Some accreditation agencies acknowledge the process needs to evolve. But critics say the Trump administration is reshaping accreditation for political reasons, and risks undermining the legitimacy of the degrees colleges and universities award to students.
Trump said during his campaign that he would wield college accreditation as a “secret weapon” to root out DEI and other “woke” ideas from higher education. He has made good on that pledge.
Over the summer, for example, the administration sent letters to the accreditors of both Columbia and Harvard universities, alleging that the schools had violated federal civil rights law, and thus their accreditation rules, by failing to prevent the harassment of Jewish students after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel.
The administration’s antipathy toward DEI has prompted some accreditors to remove diversity requirements. The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, for instance, removed diversity and inclusion language from its guiding principles earlier this year. Under White House pressure, the American Bar Association this year suspended enforcement of its DEI standards for its accreditation of law schools and has extended that suspension into next year.
But state legislatures laid the groundwork for public university accreditation changes even before Trump returned to the White House.
Some public universities report fewer international students amid Trump restrictions

In 2022, Florida enacted a law requiring the state’s public institutions to switch accreditors every cycle — usually every few years — forcing them to move away from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, known as SACSCOC.
North Carolina followed suit in 2023, with a law prohibiting the 16 universities within the University of North Carolina system and the state’s community colleges from receiving accreditation from the same agency for consecutive cycles.
Then, the consortium of six Southern university systems this summer launched its new accreditation agency, called the Commission for Public Higher Education. The participating states include Florida and North Carolina, along with Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news release that the commission will “break the ideological stronghold” that other accreditation agencies have on higher education. Speaking at Florida Atlantic University, he said the new organization will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
“We care about student achievement; we care about measurable outcomes; we care about efficiency; we care about pursuing truth; we care about preparing our students to be citizens of our republic,” DeSantis said.
Jan Friis, senior vice president for government affairs at the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, which represents accrediting agencies, said the century-old system is in the midst of its most significant changes since the federal government tied accreditation to student aid after World War II.
“If the student picks a school that’s not accredited by a recognized accreditor, they can’t spend any federal aid there,” Friis said. “Accreditation has become the ‘good housekeeping seal of approval.’”
What’s next for the new accreditor
Dan Harrison, who is leading the startup phase of the Commission for Public Higher Education, described accreditation as “the plumbing of the whole higher ed infrastructure.”
“It’s not dramatic. It’s not meant to be partisan. But it’s critical to how schools function,” said Harrison, who is the University of North Carolina System’s vice president for academic affairs.
Though the founding schools of the new commission are all in the South, Harrison said, he expects accreditation to shift away from the long-standing geography-based model. In the past, universities in the South were accredited by SACSCOC simply because of location. In the future, he said, public universities across the country might instead be grouped together because they share similar governance structures, funding constraints and oversight.
Trump’s DEI ban in K-12 schools, higher ed ruled ‘unlawful’ by federal judge

“In 2025, if you were designing accreditation from scratch, you wouldn’t build it around geography,” Harrison said. “Public universities have more in common with each other across states than they do with private or for-profit institutions in their own backyard.”
The Commission for Public Higher Education opened with an initial cohort capped at 10 institutions within the first six states. Harrison said that based on the interest, the group could have accepted 15 to 20.
“I thought we’d be at six or seven. We reached 10 quickly and across a wider range of institutions than expected,” he said. “We already have an applicant outside the founding states. That’s well ahead of where I thought we would be.”
That early interest, he said, reflects frustration among public institutions around finances. In particular, public universities are mandated to undergo audits from the state, but also feel burdened by audits required by accreditors.
“Public universities already undergo multiple audits and state budget oversight,” he said. “Then accreditation requires them to do the same work again. It feels like reinventing the wheel and it pulls faculty and staff away from teaching and research.”
Harrison estimates it will take five to seven years for the new accreditor to be fully up and running, and that institutions will need to maintain dual accreditation to avoid risking Pell Grants and federal loans.
The commission is busy assembling peer review teams made up primarily of current and former public university leaders such as governing board members, system chancellors, provosts, chief financial officers, deans and faculty. In contrast to regional accreditors, which typically draw reviewers from both public and private institutions, the new commission is prioritizing reviewers from public universities.
“Ultimately, we want to be a true nationwide accreditor,” Harrison said. “Not a regional one. Not a partisan one. Just one that is organized around sector and peer expertise.”
While the creation of a public university accreditor is new, the concept of sector-specific accreditation exists in other parts of higher education, including for two-year colleges.
Mac Powell, president of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, said that tailoring accreditation to a sector can make the peer-review model more meaningful, because reviewers can identify with similar challenges. He said reviewers have been moving away from measuring resources and bureaucratic compliance toward assessing what students actually get out of their education.
“The big shift was moving from counting inputs to asking, ‘Did students actually learn what we said they would learn?’” said Powell, whose organization accredits 138 colleges across Arizona, California, New York and the Pacific.
The most important metric all accreditation models should value is how they transition their students into the workforce, he said.
“Every accreditor today is paying much more attention to retention, persistence, transfer, career outcomes and return on investment,” Powell said. “It’s becoming less about how many books are in the library and more about whether students can find a pathway to the middle class.”
The institution evolves
Stephen Pruitt is in his first year as the president of SACSCOC, the accreditation organization that the half-dozen Southern state university systems just left. Pruitt, a Georgia native, jokes that his “Southern accent and front-porch style” has helped him break down the importance of accreditation to just about anyone.










There’s this myth that I’m sitting in Atlanta deciding if institutions are good or not. That’s not how American accreditation works.


– Stephen Pruitt, president of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges


In simple terms, he said, accreditation is the system that makes college degrees real. But he feels he has to clarify a misconception about the role of accreditation agencies like SACSCOC.
“There’s this myth that I’m sitting in Atlanta deciding if institutions are good or not,” he said. “That’s not how American accreditation works. Your peers evaluate you. People who do the same work you do.”
At the same time, Pruitt isn’t dismissing the concerns that prompted states such as Florida and North Carolina to explore alternatives to SACSCOC. According to Pruitt, institutions have long raised concerns about slow turnaround times, redundant paperwork and standards that have not always adapted quickly to the evolving landscape in higher education.
“Some of the frustration is real. Institutions want less redundancy and more responsiveness. Competition isn’t something we’re afraid of,” he said. “We’re doing a full audit of our processes. We have to be more contemporary. Faster approvals, more flexibility, more transparency. Accreditation shouldn’t just be the stick. It should be the carrot too.”

(Getty Images.)The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association wants the state supreme court to reverse a decision allowing American Electric Power to charge data centers differently than it does other power customers.
In their appeal, association attorneys called the effort a “flagrant and unlawful effort to discriminate against certain customers.”
When it approved the plan, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio characterized it as a compromise meant to ensure ordinary customers aren’t forced to pay for the costs of connecting dozens of new, power intensive facilities.
Background
The case centers on a new data center tariff that Ohio utility regulators recently approved.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A tariff sets the terms on which a power company delivers electricity. You likely get power under a residential service tariff, for instance.
Ohio’s utilities are commonly known as ‘pole and wire’ companies — regulated monopolies in charge of maintaining the state’s energy delivery system.
The PUCO sets rates and allows utilities to bill customers for building out the transmission system.
According to a data center tracker, Ohio has the fifth most data centers in the country.
In 2024, AEP told the PUCO that surge in demand from data centers presents a unique challenge for its long-term planning.
The company paused new data center service requests in March of 2023.
In its filings with the PUCO, AEP claimed it had more than 50 data centers in the queue, representing more than 30,000 megawatts of additional power demand.
To cover the cost of buildout, AEP proposed a new tariff with minimum purchase requirements and long-term contracts, with a ramp-up period and an exit fee if a data center decides to exit the market early.
The company stressed that those requirements were meant to insulate other customers from associated infrastructure costs.
In July of this year, the PUCO signed off on a negotiated version of the plan.
Data center customers must pay for at least 85% of the power they say they need — even if their actual usage is less.
Contracts would last at least 12 years, with an exit fee of three years’ worth of minimum charges.
Ohio regulators turn down appeal, OK utility’s data center billing plan

In a press release, AEP Ohio President and CEO Marc Reitter said the tariff “brings clarity and certainty for infrastructure planning.”
“We are looking forward to ending the moratorium and continuing to support development of more data centers in our service territory,” he said.
The appeal
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association criticizes not just the new tariff in its appeal, but also AEP’s moratorium on new data center customers.
“AEP unilaterally imposed this discriminatory, unnecessary, unjustified, and unlawful moratorium on connecting these new customers based solely on their business function and use of electricity,” the court filing states.
Association attorneys note state regulators never signed off on the moratorium and that it “flies in the face” of state law which requires a utility serve all customers within its territory.
Choking off the industry amounted to “improper gamesmanship,” the filing continues, which gave AEP “undue bargaining power” as the tariff case worked its way through the PUCO.
What’s more, the manufacturers association thinks AEP’s claims about future demand might be bogus.
Throughout the PUCO process, the organization insisted AEP hadn’t hadn’t shared sufficient evidence to back up its dire warnings.
The association’s appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court focuses on “unreasonable assumptions” driving the tariff approval.
The PUCO tacitly agreed AEP could refuse service through its moratorium, the association argued, and tacitly agreed that future demand presents an actual problem.
Regulators also treated a tariff singling out a specific class of user as “not unduly discriminatory” and didn’t consider the tariff a rate increase.
In a press release announcing its appeal, the organization maintained that the PUCO decision was based on “overstated and speculative transmission concerns.”
“The PUCO has rigged the scales, greenlighting utility discrimination and setting a precedent that could be used to hammer manufacturers and weaken Ohio’s economic edge,” Ohio Manufacturers’ Association President Ryan Augsburger said.
“This fight isn’t about one tariff. It’s about fairness, justice and restoring balance for the future of Ohio manufacturing.”
But AEP pushed back.
In a statement after the association filed its Ohio Supreme Court appeal, the company insisted the tariff “ensures that large data center customers will pay their fair share of the costs of the upgrades needed to serve their demand for electricity.”
The “firm contractual commitments” it requires will avoid “stranded investment costs” and protect other ratepayers, the statement said.
“Frankly,” it continued, “we are confused as to why OMA would appeal a ruling that protects their members from absorbing the costs associated with building out electric infrastructure to meet data centers’ needs.”

Now, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether or not states like Ohio can count absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day after election night.
S.B. 293
When it comes to elections, every vote counts — especially in local races.
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections data shows 10 races were within about 20 votes, with six being within 10, and there were even several ties.
In Cincinnati, the Hamilton County elections board results show that at least 12 races were within 20 votes, with eight being within 10.
This is why voting rights advocate Jen Miller with the League of Women Voters of Ohio says the state’s four-day grace period is essential.
Ballots will still be counted as long as they are returned within four days of the election if they are postmarked before Election Day.
In Cuyahoga County, 2,996 valid ballots came in during that period, more than some races even had votes.
So far, 3,373 ballots have come in since Tuesday; however, hundreds are invalid. Of the total amount, 1,461 were from registered Democrats, 611 from Republicans and 1,301 from voters without a party affiliation.
More than 360 couldn’t be counted because they came in after the grace period, the elections board said.
“It’s incredibly important that every eligible voter can cast their ballot,” Miller said.
“Our concern with Senate Bill 293 would be that many votes would not count for something that’s outside of the voter’s control, which is the speed of the mail.”
Concerns for military
The majority of Ohio Senate Republicans voted to pass S.B. 293, requiring the vast majority of ballots to be returned by the close of polls on election night.
When we first reported on the introduction of this legislation in October, veterans shared concerns about active-duty military members being disenfranchised.
Following our coverage, the lawmakers made an exemption for uniformed and overseas absentee voters.
The case for S.B. 293
Each of Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s election audits has shown no proof of widespread voter fraud, but Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said that this bill could help reassure skeptics.
“You still see people losing confidence in their election officials and the election systems in those states when there’s uncertainty that extends beyond election night,” McColley said.
For years, President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders have insisted, without evidence, that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.
Following his lead, red states have started restricting access.
Supreme Court will weigh in
Now, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it will decide whether or not ballots can be counted after Election Day, as the Republican National Committee is suing Mississippi, which has a similar law to Ohio.
“We might wind up being mandated by the Supreme Court at some point in the future,” McColley said. “We also, I do think, need to look at the 50 laboratories of democracy.”
Ohio wouldn’t be an outlier in the states that make the absentee deadline Election Day.
Dozens of states, like Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, all require ballots to be in on or before Election Day.
Miller says S.B. 293 will hurt voters.
According to state data, nearly 10,000 ballots came in during the four days after the 2024 presidential election.
“Senior citizens, people with disabilities, rural Ohioans, students — these are all populations that are more likely to need to vote absentee, but may also be affected by a slower mail service,” she said.
The Ohio House will hear the bill in the coming months.

(Photo by Getty Images)As a mom with kids in Kansas schools, I see the future of our state every day. I see it every time we talk about college applications, first jobs, and what kind of future my kids want to build here in Kansas.
But as the president and CEO of an organization that works with educators, employers and policymakers across Kansas and Missouri, I also see the widening gap between the skills our students are learning and the demands of today’s workforce. The gap threatens the strength of our communities, the future of our economy, and most importantly, our kids.
Across the state of Kansas, I continue to hear the same message. In Hutchinson, business owners say they can’t fill positions. In Wichita, hospitals are short on nurses and technicians. In Salina, manufacturers can’t find enough trained workers to keep up with demand. These are not isolated challenges. They are symptoms of a talent pipeline that isn’t keeping pace with the needs of Kansas employers.
My organization has spent the past year traveling across the state on a Cradle to Career Listening Tour. We met with parents, teachers, students, and business leaders in every corner of Kansas to ask what’s working and what isn’t. Their message was clear: We have to do more to educate the future workforce that our state will need.
The path from classroom to career begins long before graduation. Early childhood education gives our kids the foundation to learn.
It continues with strong K–12 schools that retain great teachers in the classroom.
It extends through technical training and higher education that prepares students for real, high-skilled jobs.
When any part of that system falters, families and communities experience the impact. Parents who can’t find affordable child care are forced to step out of the workforce. Schools that lose experienced teachers struggle to maintain stability and quality. And when students can’t see how their education connects to real careers, too many leave Kansas to find opportunity somewhere else.
However, Kansans also know what works. Parents and educators told us about career and technical education programs that connect students directly to employers. Businesses shared how apprenticeships help students earn while they learn. Communities talked about partnerships that make college more affordable and accessible. These are Kansas solutions, grounded in practicality and collaboration.
If we want to stay competitive as a state, we must treat education as the backbone of our economy. Just as we invest in roads and broadband, we must invest in the systems that build human potential. Our teachers, our schools, and our training programs are not expenses, they are economic infrastructure.
As a mom and business leader who is passionate about helping Kansas kids succeed, I feel the urgency of this moment. The future workforce is sitting in our classrooms today. Whether those students stay in Kansas, build their careers here, and raise their families here depends on the choices we make now.
What gives me hope is the Kansas spirit I’ve seen in every community visited on the listening tour. People are willing to come together, to listen, and to find common ground. Parents, educators, and employers all want the same thing: a future where every child has the chance to succeed and every business has the talent it needs to grow.
As we look ahead to the 2026 legislative session, we have an opportunity to turn those conversations into action. Investing in education is not a partisan issue, it is a Kansas priority.
If we want a strong workforce tomorrow, we have to educate students today. Our future depends on it.

The approval of the three bills after nightfall was preceded by an all-day debate and party-line vote on a fourth bill adopting a revised version of an omnibus housing bill vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont in June. Senate votes are planned on all four bills Thursday, and Lamont pledges to sign them.

House Bill 8001, legislation enabling UConn Health to purchase Waterbury Hospital from an out-of-state owner in bankruptcy, passed on a 133-11 vote that reflected the bipartisan negotiations preceding the vote, as well as the hospital’s economic and medical importance to the state’s fifth-largest city and its suburbs.
In an era when hospital chains are dominating health care, the measure also allows the university’s teaching hospital to purchase two independent nonprofit hospitals, Bristol and Day Kimball. UConn has an agreement to buy Waterbury Hospital for $13 million. 
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, introduced the bill as “a forward-thinking proposal that will protect access to health care for thousands of Connecticut residents while strengthening the state’s public health system for generations to come across Connecticut.”
The bill allows UConn Health to create subsidiaries or joint ventures in order to purchase the hospitals while authorizing $390 million in bonding to support capital improvements at the facilities the health network acquires. The debt will be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at the University of Connecticut.
Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, who was born in Waterbury Hospital, celebrated the bill as bringing a valued community resource back from near death.
“It’s comforting to know that we have a solution to a problem that has persisted and plagued the greater Waterbury area,” he said.
Horn said the bill is critical to securing the future of all three hospitals. 
“Without intervention, we risk losing these facilities and the service that they provide to their communities. The bill we have in front of us offers a responsible, sustainable solution to that,” Horn said.
Curbing ICE activities
The final measure passed Wednesday night, House Bill 8004, was a compilation of unrelated provisions, including a child behavioral health measure incorporating the recommendations of a study group.
“We are happy to see that the legislature is taking up recommendations from the Transforming Children’s Behavioral Health Policy and Planning Committee,” said Christina Gio, the state’s child advocate. “The study of existing behavioral health services and future demand for services is critically important to ensuring that children have access to appropriate mental health services when they need them.”
Among other things, it would increase the age at which people are eligible for autism therapies and services from 21 to 26. It would also require a committee on children’s behavioral health to study existing services for that population and develop a survey for school-based health centers, add three new members to that committee, and require the committee to convene a working group
“Currently, children may need crisis intervention, such as intensive in-home child and adolescent psychiatric services, and be put on a months-long wait list,” Ghio said in a statement. “The study will help the state identify what services children need and plan for the development of a continuum of mental health services for children so that children in crisis are not waiting for treatment.”
It was the least controversial element of the final bill. The measure also would impose a 5-cent charge on mobile phone bills to raise money for a firefighters’ cancer relief fund. Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said the state should appropriate money directly for the fund, instead of taxing phone bills.
But the provisions drawing the most attention were those intended to curb the activities of Immigrations and Custom Enforcement agents in and around state courthouses.
One provision codified in state law the judicial system’s policy barring ICE arrests in courthouses without a judicial warrant. It also expands the ban to courthouse grounds and bans law enforcement from wearing masks in and around courts.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the measure creates the sense of doing more  than it actually accomplishes.
“Advocates outside of these walls think that they are getting protection through this legislation. They aren’t. They’ve been sold a bill of goods,” said Fishbein, a lawyer and the ranking House Republican on the Judiciary Committee.
The bill states that federal and state law enforcement agents cannot arrest or detain someone at a courthouse based on a civil offense, which includes staying in the country on an expired visa. But entering the country illegally is a federal crime, Fishbein said.
“An individual who has entered this country illegally has no protection under this language, even though advocates have been told, ‘You’re protected,'” he said.
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, replied that the bill was valuable even if it only protected a small number of people.
“I personally think this bill goes further than that. I think that this bill also protects many folks who are undocumented,” he said. “All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses.”
It passed on a 96-48 vote with every Republican and two Democrats, Jill Barry of Glastonbury and Michale DiGiovancarlo of Waterbury, opposed.

(Photo via the Colleen Farmer.)Although it’s all around us, most people in Florida never think about where their water comes from. They turn on the faucet, a clear liquid flows out, and that’s all they care about. But Colleen Farmer can’t afford to be so naive.
Colleen Farmer via subject
Farmer lives in Crystal River, and she’s worried that the Florida Department of Transportation and one of its contractors are attacking the source of her drinking water.
You might be inclined to scoff, but something remarkable happened last week to suggest she’s right to be concerned.
Here’s how the Citrus County Chronicle reported it: “A Florida Turnpike contractor operating an excavator at a proposed sand mine site in north Citrus County was suddenly inundated with water last week, forcing the operator to swim to safety, according to witnesses and local residents.”
Holy cow! The excavator sank like the Titanic! Excavator operators don’t normally wear personal flotation devices, but maybe it’s time they started.
The Chronicle, in a follow-up note on Facebook, reported that a DOT division known as the Florida Turnpike Authority “said it confirmed that the construction activity did not affect the underlying aquifer system.”
Yet even after the excavator was pulled loose, “the water in the ‘pond’ is not receding,” Farmer told me. “We know that it is not likely that there was any standing water on that property before they started digging. The water could have only come from one place, the spring below.”
Farmer co-chairs an organization called Stop the Sand Mine in Citrus County. It has now filed a formal complaint with both the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Southwest Florida Water Management District, seeking “enforcement action concerning unpermitted excavation and groundwater exposure.”
How the Crystal River folks got to this point with the 320-acre mine site, she said, is “a long story with lots of twists and turns.” The one constant, she told me, is this: Nobody in local or state government wants to tell the citizens what’s happening.

Manatee madness
Crystal River holds some of Florida’s most fascinating history.
The highest point for miles around, for instance, is a 28-foot-tall temple mound of shells in Crystal River Archaeological State Park. It marks the site of one of the longest continuously occupied pre-Columbian locations in Florida. People who lived there would trade with villages thousands of miles away. 
These days, shells are less important. Instead, Crystal River has a manatee-based economy. Manatee signs and figures here are as ubiquitous as Mickey Mouse ears at Disney World. Most are advertising tours to experience manatees first-hand, but that’s not all.
The first time I visited Citrus County, I was astonished at how many businesses had “manatee” in their names, even though they had nothing to do with sea cows. Auto repair, appliance sales, you name it and people were trying to be associated with manatees.
And to top it all off, every January, there’s a two-day Florida Manatee Festival.
Crystal River’s manatee madness started with a scientist named Daniel “Woodie” Hartman, who in the late 1960s and early ’70s repeatedly dove into Kings Bay to conduct the first in-depth studies of the manatees that routinely gathered there.
Hartman became so close with some of his study subjects that from time to time they would grasp his face mask in their flippers and bestow on him something like a kiss.
Jacques Yves-Cousteau via IMDB
In 1969, Hartman wrote about his research for National Geographic, which led to a 1972 Jacques Yves-Cousteau TV special on manatees, titled “Forgotten Mermaids.” Cousteau’s special tantalized viewers worldwide and they began flocking to Crystal River to see — and to swim with — the manatees.
The manatees are attracted to Crystal River by the springs that feed Kings Bay. Those springs flow from the aquifer that provides humans with their drinking water. The underground cave system that the aquifer flows through has been known, from time to time, to open up a sinkhole to the surface.
The site where the proposed sand mine is located lies within an area that’s supposed to receive enhanced protection. It’s in the Kings Bay Outstanding Florida Spring Priority Focus Area, as well as an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a Special Flood Hazard Area.
A DOT engineer’s report on the sand mine site pointed out that it is “underlain by limestone bedrock that is susceptible to dissolution and the subsequent development of … sinkholes.”
While Farmer and other members of her group are concerned about that, no one in local or state government appears to be.
Just guessing
A crucial part of this sand mine story is the toll road known as the Suncoast Parkway. I’ve been writing about the Suncoast for 25 years — usually about how it’s based on bogus figures.
The first story, published in 2000, reported on how a DOT consultant known as URS Greiner Woodward Clyde, had repeatedly produced inflated traffic projections. Those numbers were used to justify launching the construction of unneeded toll roads around the state.
“In 1992 URS predicted the Suncoast Parkway would be so popular it would make $70 million in 2002 and $119 million in 2010,” the story reported. “That persuaded the state to proceed with planning the highway.”
But then URS repeatedly scaled back its projections until it said the Suncoast would bring in only $14 million in 2002 and $31 million by 2010. If it had given those figures first, the road would never have been built.
“Ten years ago, we were basically guessing,” a URS official told me then, not sounding the least bit embarrassed. “Even two years ago.”
Even those updated projections turned out to be wrong. In 2014, the Suncoast drew so little traffic that it collected only $22 million.
But by then, the DOT was already pushing to build an extension called “Suncoast 2” another 13 miles north through Citrus County. Providing the traffic projections: The same consultant that had been so wrong before.
“There’s very little population in that area so there’s no good reason to build this road,” a member of the Suncoast Sierra Club said then. “It seems like a costly gift to road builders and developers at the expense of the environment — the very opposite of smart growth.”
Now the DOT’s Turnpike Enterprise division is working on extending the unsuccessful Suncoast even further north. To do that, they need a lot of sand, and for their convenience they’d prefer to acquire it from a new sand mine right next door to their right of way.
And that’s where George Southworth comes in.
Enter sandman
Southworth isn’t just the owner of the sand mine property. He’s also one of the DOT’s longtime contractors. He runs a Tampa company called Concrete Impressions of Florida that manufactures sound barriers.
George Southworth via Pilot Bancshares
“What I do for a living is build walls,” he told WFTS-TV in 2017, when he was offering his company’s help in building Donald Trump’s border wall. (Yes, really.) “For the last 20 years we’ve built millions upon millions of sound barriers along the side of the interstate.”
As Mark Twain might have put it, there’s gold in them thar walls. Southworth has made so much money off that and his other real estate interests that by 2014 he’d become the largest single shareholder in Pilot Bancshares, the parent company of Pilot Bank.
I talked on the phone with Southworth, who told me the people opposed to his sand mine are just a bunch of bored retirees who don’t know what they’re talking about.
“I really do like the environment,” he told me.
That prompted me to ask about his citation for harming a gopher tortoise.
In 2022, Southworth was cited by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for illegally harming or killing a gopher tortoise, classified as a threatened species. Pasco County court records show he pleaded no contest.
He told me this case resulted from a complaint from a vindictive neighbor. He said he pleaded no contest and paid $241 in court costs just to make the case go away. When I asked what he’d done to the gopher tortoise, he blamed one of his employees for damaging a tortoise burrow.
That wasn’t the only accusation he faced from Pasco neighbors. One accused him of illegally cutting down trees, prompting the water district to warn him to stop. The neighbor said he boasted on a conference call that he could “nuke” any wetland on his property and get away with it.
That’s important because on his Crystal River property, where he wants to begin mining sand to sell to the DOT, the Adventure Coast Sierra Club says, “The land has scattered wetlands onsite, and a biological survey found gopher tortoises and Sherman’s fox squirrels.”
Southworth told me repeatedly how his sand mine would be so much better for the aquifer than building another pollution-spewing subdivision or big shopping mall.
When I asked him how the excavator turned into  “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” he started laughing.
“I don’t know what happened,” he said. “That has nothing to do with the sand mine.”
He told me the luckless excavator was working for the DOT, digging a retention pond for the toll road.
“For the life of me,” he said, “I can’t understand why he was digging a hole that deep.”
‘The people that care’
Before I talked to Southworth, I watched a public hearing about the mine site at which he spoke briefly. There were 60 or so people there opposed to the mine. Southworth contended that his apparent unpopularity was misleading.
“The people that are in favor of this don’t come to meetings,” he said. “The only people that come to meetings are the people that care.”
Darryl Johnston via screen grab
Christian Waugh via Waugh website
The meeting at which Southworth spoke was held because he was seeking a change in the zoning from “agriculture” to “extractive.” Presiding over this quasi-judicial proceeding was a special master named Christian Waugh.
During the hearing, Southworth’s attorney, Darryl Johnston, repeatedly told Waugh that the mining wouldn’t affect the aquifer or the drinking water of neighbors such as Farmer.
After listening to testimony for three hours, Waugh asked several questions. One was whether, after all the sand is removed, the mining site could be restored to its pristine state, as required by the county’s comprehensive growth plan.
George Foster via screen grab
“It obviously cannot be,” Southworth’s engineer, George Foster, replied. “It’s gonna be a lake.”
To restore the mine to its original condition, Foster said, would require digging up tons of sand from somewhere else and dumping it back on Southworth’s property.
“I was very shocked to hear that,” Waugh said. “Until that point, I was prepared to recommend approval, but I can’t go against the comp plan.”
Waugh’s recommendation that the county deny Southworth’s zoning change was a wrinkle that neither Southworth nor the DOT expected.
When I asked Southworth about it, he insisted that Waugh interpreted the comp plan language incorrectly and added, “Whether he was politically influenced or just wrong, I don’t know.”
He said everyone better just get used to the DOT doing whatever it wants.
“Florida is growing, and they’re building this turnpike to promote and accommodate the growth,” he said.
The DOT is now acquiring about 50 acres of Southworth’s parcel. The agency seems prepared to push ahead with the mine. As DOT district secretary Justin Hall told Citrus County commissioners, the DOT is not bound by local land-use regulations.
But the state agency that spreads pavement wherever it goes is supposed to be bound by the state and federal regulations that protect both the aquifer and Kings Bay.
Safe for the springs
A couple of weeks ago, before that excavator turned into “The Poseidon Adventure,” the DOT held a public hearing in Crystal River. The hearing was about its next Suncoast Parkway extension.
Two Sierra Club volunteers, Robin Orlandi and P.J. Aufhammer, showed up and asked lots of questions. I talked to both of them.
Robin Orlandi via Sierra Club
Orlandi told me one of the DOT experts at the hearing suggested that the agency might use Southworth’s site for a retention pond for the new toll road.
“It sounded like they were going to create a sand mine without calling it a sand mine,” she told me.
The DOT folks made it clear to the pair that this latest iteration of the Suncoast would be built despite any public opposition. It is as inevitable as the villainous Thanos in “Avengers: Endgame.” That’s because if it’s not connected to U.S. 19, the truncated Suncoast will continue to fail to attract traffic.
But that doesn’t mean Southworth’s sand mine is inevitable.
Orlandi said she’d like to see that property wind up as part of the Florida Wildlife Corridor, which has run into a roadblock (pun intended) in that part of Citrus County.
Farmer told me something similar, but less specific.
“This land sits over the water that gives life to Kings Bay and our community,” she told me. “We want it protected — not mined, not paved, not filled with septic tanks. It should stay … safe for our springs.”
All I know is, the DOT better fix this situation before everyone’s faucets start producing something that no one will want to swallow.

Connecticut faces some serious challenges these days. Home prices are endlessly climbing upwards, pushing working folks into poverty, out on the streets, or out of the state. Our car traffic is some of the worst in the country. Carbon emissions are on the rise, accelerating the pace of climate change. What can we do to deal with these multifaceted, yet interconnected issues? 
Let’s address these problems one at a time. The simplest way to lower the cost of a home is to build more of them, but through zoning regulations, many Connecticut towns only allow for the construction of single-family homes on large plots of land. If we rely solely on this model, we would have to devastate countless acres of our state’s natural areas in order to build the quantity of housing we need to lower aggregate costs. 
Additionally, the physical distance between residential and commercial areas that single-family zoning creates makes car ownership a necessity. This has two major drawbacks. Firstly, cars are a huge contributor to carbon emissions and thus, climate change. Secondly, more cars means more traffic for everybody. One of the biggest reasons cited for opposition to new housing is the impact of new developments on local car traffic. 
The state has created quite a conundrum for itself. If we want home prices to go down, we need to build more housing, but if we only build single-family homes, we’re stuck with more traffic, more pollution, and less wildlife. What is the answer to this perplexing problem? 
Trains are the answer. Trains offer commuters a climate-friendly alternative to gridlock traffic and its poisonous exhaust. Trains enable the development of walkable communities, creating arteries of transportation that allow us to build housing up instead of out, preserving our precious greenspace. 
The Nutmeg State is crisscrossed with train tracks, many of which now lie abandoned or disused, relegated to the infrequent shuttling of freight. These forgotten tracks offer us an exciting opportunity; if we upgrade these tracks to support passenger service and build walkable housing adjacent to revitalized stations, we can cut through Connecticut’s Gordian Knot of transportation, housing, and environmental issues.
This proposal isn’t mere daydreaming; states like Maryland, New York, and Montana  have already embarked on this journey, recognizing the huge potential offered by rail reactivation. The Train Campaign now calls upon the Connecticut Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study to explore the reactivation of passenger rail service on two underutilized tracks: the Maybrook and Housatonic (aka Berkshire) lines. This study should aim to determine the most economically beneficial and least costly options for reactivating these lines, with findings made available to Connecticut policymakers by January 2027.
The Maybrook Line connects the Waterbury, Danbury, and Harlem Metro-North lines, offering a potential new east–west transportation corridor for Connecticut and New York. The Housatonic Line could reconnect communities along the Massachusetts border, reopening a historic route between Pittsfield and Danbury.
We wouldn’t be building from scratch. The tracks already exist, and several former stations remain. The potential to boost accessibility, stimulate local economies, and reduce traffic and emissions is enormous.
We urge the Connecticut Department of Transportation to undertake this feasibility study with an eye towards determining which project would yield the greatest benefits while being the most feasible to implement. If you support such a study being conducted, please click here to sign our petition. In doing so, you are helping us push forward a greener and more connected Connecticut.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The General Assembly’s top budget analyst cautioned lawmakers against draining the state’s cash reserves to offset a nearly $1.5 billion  deficit that has emerged in the coming fiscal year.
With lawmakers unlikely to raise taxes in an election year, one potential option for covering more than half the shortfall would be to pull $815 million from the state’s $2.3 billion rainy day account. But Department of Legislative Services budget analyst David Romans warned that could hurt the state’s bond-rating now and leave it unprepared for greater deficits in later years.
“I would put a plea out there that as you work on the thinking about your strategy for balancing fiscal ’27, that you try to make some headway for fiscal ’28,” when Romans said the budget challenge “is rather daunting.”
His comments came during a meeting Wednesday of the joint Spending Affordability Committee in one of the first briefings on the fiscal 2027 budget 0utlook.
Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a fiscal 2026 compromise budget that eliminated a projected $3.3 billion budget deficit through a combination of one-time fund transfers, budget cuts and $1.6 billion in taxes. Lawmakers believed that put them on solid ground for 2027, even though they knew that deficits in the billions could return in fiscal 2028 and beyond.
The latest budget projections hastened the return of those deficit projections by a year. After the projected fiscal 2027 budget gap of just under $1.5 billion, the structural budget deficit is expected to more than double in fiscal 2028 to $3.2 billion, before growing to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2029 and roughly $4 billion in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.
Budget concerns resurface as state faces projected $1.4 billion gap for coming year

“This isn’t about resources—it’s about restraint,” Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said in a statement. “You can’t promise everything to everyone and then feign shock when the math doesn’t work.”
The largest driver of those costs is the K-12 education reform program known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Lawmakers will likely have to make adjustments to how the plan is implemented in order to bend the curve on ongoing costs.
“I think the bottom line here is Marylanders have nothing left to give,” said Delegate Jefferson L. Ghrist (R-Upper Shore), a House Appropriations Committee member. “The Democratic supermajority continues to take, with historic increases in taxes and fees and an insatiable appetite for spending. Meanwhile, the government continues to grow, so the problem only gets worse.
“As massive as a $1.4 billion deficit is, the long-term projections to pay for the Blueprint in the coming years are staggering,” Ghrist said. “We knew this in 2020 when the Blueprint bill passed. The truth is, no matter who is in the White House, it was always going to be this way.”
In the near term, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said tax increases are off the table.
“This is not a time where we can go for increased revenues. Last session was brutal,” Ferguson said during a Wednesday morning interview on WBAL radio. “I think Marylanders are feeling costs everywhere, and so we are going to have to make some very hard decisions this year about how to bend the curve. We can’t keep this cycle up. This is not how we will grow, and growth is the only thing that will ultimately get us out of this.”
Republicans, however, said they fear more tax hikes are in the offing – if not now, then soon.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The 2026 session will be an Election Year Budget, and Democrats will do everything possible to paper over the problem until after November,” Ready said in his statement. “But Marylanders deserve honesty. Even if they delay new tax hikes this year, the out-years will be brutal. These programs are growing faster than our economy — and the bill is coming due.”
While dealing with the budget, Ferguson and the General Assembly also face the potential for a special legislative session to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts. Ferguson has opposed the effort, and in a statement to Maryland Matters, he implied that such a session would be a distraction from the budget.
“The highest and best use of the General Assembly’s time is keeping Maryland on strong fiscal footing by lowering costs for Maryland families and addressing the $1.4 billion structural deficit so we can meet our constitutional obligation to pass a balanced budget next session,” Ferguson said.
In Wednesday’s briefing, analysts presented a scenario in which lawmakers would pull nearly $1 billion from two accounts, the largest being the $815 million from the state’s rainy day account.
State law requires a minimum balance of 5% of general fund revenues be in the fund, which is meant as a bulwark against a severe economic downturn. Currently, the fund has $2.3 billion, about 8% of general fund revenues. By drawing down the fund, lawmakers could trim the projected deficit to a more manageable $500 million.
Panel recommends issuing up to $1.75 billion in bonds for coming fiscal year

“There are a number of downsides to that, but I want to highlight one: It does not provide any structural relief,” Romans said. “So, it doesn’t do anything for solving fiscal ’28.
“It also means you’ve spent that $800 million, so it’s not there to help you in the ’28 problem and it also isn’t there if we go into an actual recession, which is certainly a risk with the various federal cuts that seem to be continuing,” he said.
Romans described the balance as “pretty healthy” but added the amount is “is lower than typical for most of the other AAA-rated states.”
An October review of reserves held by all 50 states found Maryland could run state government for 29 days, compared to a 50-state median of 47 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trust Report.
Draining the reserve account to the bare minimum might harm the state’s credit rating. For more than five decades, the state enjoyed the highest rating from the three major bond rating agencies. Governors and lawmakers pointed to the so-called “triple triple-A bond rating” as a sign of their fiscal stewardship.
That changed in May, when Moody’s downgraded the state’s credit rating to Aa1.
The two other firms — Fitch and Standard & Poor’s — continued to give the state their highest rating. But both raised concerns about the costs of state government programs, including the Blueprint and pensions. They might take a dim view of the state tapping the rainy day fund rather than addressing ongoing costs and revenues, Romans said.
“The rating agencies that continue to rate us as AAA on our bonds have expressed concern,” Romans said. “One, about our structural budget challenge in the out years, and two, they’ve noted that our rainy day fund balance, while, pretty healthy at 8% for Maryland, is lower than typical for most of the other AAA-rated states. So, I think they would have concerns if we raid the rainy day fund balance, take it all the way down to 5% and aren’t making much progress on the structural challenge.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5248-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 23:56:29.797118

Move by $80 billion crypto giant Coinbase highlights rising competition for Delaware’s incorporation business
WILMINGTON, Del. — Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is pulling its corporate charter out of Delaware and reincorporating in Texas — a high-profile defection that adds fuel to talk of a “Dexit” and raises fresh questions about one of Delaware’s most important revenue streams.
The company, founded in 2012 and long incorporated in Delaware, disclosed in a Wednesday filing that shareholders approved a plan to move its legal home to Texas. Coinbase is valued at roughly $80 billion, generated about $7.7 billion in revenue over the last year, and reported around $3.2 billion in net income, according to recent financial disclosures — making it one of the most profitable firms ever to walk away from Delaware’s corporate franchise.
Coinbase’s decision does not affect its largely remote workforce or day-to-day trading operations. Still, it severs a symbolic tie to a state that has spent decades marketing itself as the nation’s corporate capital.
What is ‘Dexit’?
Corporate lawyers have dubbed moves like Coinbase’s “Dexit” — short for “Delaware exit” — a catch-all term for companies that are relocating their legal domicile to other states.
Concerns about Dexit accelerated after Delaware’s Court of Chancery voided Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla compensation package in early 2024, despite shareholder approval. Musk responded by urging companies to avoid Delaware and later shifted Tesla and SpaceX to Texas, a move that emboldened other founders and investors to explore alternatives.
Since then, a growing list of public companies and investment firms — including Tesla, SpaceX, Andreessen Horowitz, Pershing Square Capital and others — have either left or publicly weighed leaving Delaware, often citing legal uncertainty and an uptick in shareholder litigation risk.
Texas and Nevada have aggressively courted those corporations with reforms that promise more predictable court treatment of boards and executives. Legal scholars note that while Delaware still dominates incorporation, Dexit has evolved from a social-media slogan into a real point of leverage for rival states.
Why Coinbase is leaving Delaware
In an opinion piece explaining the move, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the company no longer sees Delaware’s courts as reliably business-friendly, warning of “surprises” and “politically charged rulings” that undermine board and shareholder expectations.
Recent decisions have expanded potential liability for controlling shareholders and directors, which critics say encourages more lawsuits and makes it harder for companies to predict outcomes in big-ticket cases.
Texas, by contrast, has created a specialized Business Court system and passed Senate Bill 29, which more explicitly protects the traditional “business judgment rule” — the idea that courts should defer to boards on most good-faith decisions.
For Coinbase, there’s also a political and industry angle. Texas has carved out a reputation as one of the country’s more crypto-friendly states, from hosting large Bitcoin mining operations to exploring a strategic Bitcoin reserve. CEO Brian Armstrong has aligned himself with pro-crypto, pro-business politicians and backed efforts to loosen digital-asset regulation at the federal level.
Roughly 78% of Coinbase’s voting power supported the switch, according to filings.
How much money is at stake for Delaware?
In sheer dollars, Coinbase is just one taxpayer among thousands. The immediate hit to Delaware’s books from a single reincorporation is likely to be modest.
The larger fear is what happens if Coinbase is a leading indicator.
Delaware’s state budget is unusually dependent on its role as a home for corporations and their “abandoned” financial assets:


Corporate franchise and related incorporation fees are projected at about $1.8 billion a year and are the state’s second-largest revenue source after personal income tax.


Unclaimed property — everything from uncashed checks to unused gift cards tied to Delaware-incorporated companies — adds another $400–550 million a year and accounts for roughly 6–7% of the state budget.


Taken together, those two corporate-driven streams represent roughly one-third of Delaware’s General Fund revenues, according to state reports and independent analyses. For fiscal 2025, Delaware budget officials forecast about $6.66 billion in General Fund revenue — meaning even a 5–10% erosion in franchise and unclaimed-property collections would force difficult choices on spending or taxes.
In March, Gov. Matt Meyer underscored the stakes when he defended a controversial bill aimed at reassuring billionaire founders that Delaware would remain attractive, saying the state “needs and wants those $2 billion in incorporation revenues every year, plus a related $420 million” from abandoned accounts as reported by WHYY on March 25, 2025.
Coinbase’s departure doesn’t blow a hole in that number by itself. But if large, profitable firms come to see Texas or Nevada as the safer default, Delaware could see its once-steady franchise cash cow turn choppy.
A warning shot for Delaware’s ‘corporate brand’
Analysts have long noted that Delaware’s advantage rests less on tax rates than on a trusted legal framework: a responsive Division of Corporations, an expert Court of Chancery and a well-understood body of corporate law.
Coinbase’s move calls that brand into question.
Credit analysts and business groups have already warned that Delaware’s heavy reliance on franchise and unclaimed-property revenues makes the state vulnerable to shifts in corporate behavior or federal court rulings. The recent MoneyGram unclaimed-property case and other challenges have shown how quickly hundreds of millions of dollars can be put at risk.
The Dexit drumbeat adds a second pressure point: competition.


Nevada markets itself as a low-litigation alternative and has been explicitly promoting Dexit to corporate counsel as reported in the Journal of Corporation Law.


Texas has paired legal reforms with a broader pro-business pitch and is now able to point to marquee names — Tesla, SpaceX and Coinbase among them — as proof of concept.


For now, Delaware still hosts more than half of U.S. public companies and the majority of the Fortune 500.  State lawmakers also updated parts of the corporate code this year in an effort to calm fears raised by Musk and other critics.
The question is whether moves like Coinbase’s will remain symbolic outliers — or signal a broader rebalancing of where America does business on paper.

What comes next for the Delaware economy?
Budget writers in Dover are watching closely.   If Dexit accelerates, Delaware could be forced to:


Diversify revenues away from franchise and unclaimed-property windfalls and toward more traditional taxes that fall directly on residents and in-state businesses.


Revisit corporate law changes that critics say have pushed boards and founders toward Texas and Nevada; and


Reassess long-term growth plans that implicitly assume incorporation revenues will keep pace with rising spending.

Reduce the Growth Rate of the Government that has been growing at 8-9% while the population has been growing at 1%.

For ordinary Delawareans, the immediate impact of Coinbase’s move is invisible. There are no local jobs to lose, and the state still enjoys a large budget surplus cushion this year.
But as more big-name firms question whether Delaware is still the safest legal home, the state’s leaders may face a tougher sell: convincing both Wall Street and Wilmington that the First State can remain the corporate capital of America — without putting its own finances on shakier ground.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-231202.jpg,,,2025-11-12 23:56:29.797118

But jousting continues among Republicans and Democrats — including those from Washington state — over who’s to blame for the longest ever shuttering of the federal government. The 43-day political meltdown jeopardized families’ food benefits, snarled air travel and left some federal employees working without pay.
Wednesday evening, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed the resolution 222-209 to fund parts of the federal government through the end of January and other parts through next fall. The Senate acted on Monday. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation.
Washington state’s House delegation voted as anticipated: Republican U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse of Sunnyside and Michael Baumgartner of Spokane supported the measure along with one Democratic defector, U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Skamania County. Gluesenkamp Perez is known for breaking ranks with her party and faces a tough reelection fight next year.
The state’s other seven Democratic House members opposed the package.
“The performative tactics that we have watched over the last seven weeks have truly been a disservice to Americans,” U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, said in a floor speech before the final vote. “But the most important thing right now is that we get back to work making sure the federal government can provide the essential services that people depend on.”
In an interview, Newhouse said the lengthy shutdown didn’t help anybody and was glad some Democrats in the Senate “finally came to their senses” to open the government. “Republicans have been on the right of this from the beginning,” he said. 
Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, was among the many Democrats offering rebuttals in the hourlong debate preceding the vote.
“This bill fails to address the fundamental needs of families across our country,” she said, blaming the rising cost of health care premiums on Republicans’ opposition to extending Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.
“President Trump and Republicans promised to lower costs on day one, and that’s been one big broken promise,” DelBene said.
The MGP factor
Gluesenkamp Perez’s vote was one of the more closely watched. She is one of her party’s most vulnerable members in next year’s midterm election because her 3rd Congressional District leans Republican. Trump won it in 2024.
Her vote wasn’t surprising. When the House passed its original short-term continuing resolution in September, she missed the vote but said she would have supported it. 
In a statement Wednesday, she called the shutdown “a case study in why most Americans can’t stand Congress.”
“Americans can’t afford for their Representatives to get so caught up in landing a partisan win that they abandon their obligation to come together to solve the urgent problems that our nation faces,” she said.
Congress, she continued, needs to focus on the economy, health care and reestablishing “a truly deliberative democracy. I’ll work with whoever is necessary to reach those goals – and I don’t give a damn which side of the aisle they sit on,” she said.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s vote didn’t cost her the backing of DelBene, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of House Democrats. 
“The reason we win is because we have representatives who are authentic to their communities,” DelBene said. “Unlike Republicans who are blindly loyal to Donald Trump, we have representatives who are going to make the decisions they think are best for their community.”
Shasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said Gluesenkamp Perez’s focus on affordability and cost of living is the playbook that led to Democratic victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia this month.
Gluesenkamp Perez “will be a linchpin for Democrats to retake control of the House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections,” Conrad said.
Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, skewered the Democratic senators who helped pass the continuing resolution. But she stood by her House colleague who sided with Republicans.
“She knows her district better than anyone, and we need her in the House,” Strickland said.
‘I am really proud’
Baumgartner gave a nod to the six House Democrats who crossed over.
“The Democrats’ decision to shut down the government was a monumental waste of time that hurt a lot of people,” he said. “I thank the Democrats who were willing to work across the aisle to end this needless shutdown and put country over party.”
There are hard feelings between some Democrats in each chamber, as they look to unite on the issue of health care and extending the tax credits.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, a leading progressive voice in the caucus, who opposed the resolution, said on social media that Senate Democrats “should not have caved.” She’s among a clutch of House Democrats supporting the ouster of Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer as Senate minority leader.
“I am really proud of House Democrats who stood up and fought back and refused to cave, and have been the wind behind the sails to make sure that the Senate held out as long as they did,” she said on social media. “This was a righteous fight for the health care of the American people.”
Up next
Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, has said the Senate will hold a vote by mid-December on the issue of health care subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, are reportedly negotiating on the content of what will reach the floor.
House Democrats want a three-year extension of the tax credits and are trying to get a majority of the chamber to sign onto a petition to force a vote on the proposal.
DelBene said many Republicans have said they think the tax credits need to be extended. 
“If they’re serious about that, they have the opportunity to join us to move that legislation forward,” she said.
Newhouse said he’s open to further debate on health care.
“What’s called the Affordable Care Act has become an unaffordable care law,” he said. “I don’t see a clean extension happening. There would have to be some reforms instituted.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmay72025-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-13 02:47:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT delegation opposes shutdown deal over health care subsidies,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/government-shutdown-house-deal-ct/,CT Democrats said they will continue to fight to extend premium subsidies that will soon expire for Affordable Care Act health plans.,"The House returned Wednesday after a nearly two-month break and took the final step toward ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, but members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, who opposed the deal because it didn’t extend health care subsidies, were not counted among the yes votes.
All five members of Connecticut’s delegation joined most House Democrats in voting against the funding package that will reopen the government after 43 days. They rejected the Senate’s shutdown deal mainly because it made no guarantee to extend enhanced premium subsidies that will soon expire for those on Affordable Care Act health plans — or in Connecticut, the state’s marketplace Access Health CT. They also objected to the absence of submarine funding in the measure.
As part of the deal, Senate Republican leadership promised to hold a vote by the second week of December on an extension, though the House hasn’t committed to such a vote. The funding package also includes three separate bills to fund parts of the government through fiscal year 2026, in addition to a short-term bill for the remaining agencies only through Jan. 30.
The bill does guarantee back pay for furloughed federal workers — a requirement of a 2019 law — though President Donald Trump has suggested at times they might not get paid. It also reverses layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, which were already paused by federal judges. The bill passed in a nearly party-line vote, 222-209. Trump will sign the bill Wednesday night, marking the official end to the shutdown.
“The whole exercise was pointless, it was wrong, it was cruel,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. said shortly before the vote, noting the airline disruptions and missed paychecks for federal workers. “We’re not going to let them succeed in that game.”
The fate of health care subsidies is uncertain at best. They are set to expire on Dec. 31 if there’s no congressional action. If they expire, those who only receive the enhanced tax credit would see their premiums rise in 2026, while those who earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level would get less assistance than they do now.
In the coming weeks, House Democrats will try to force a vote on the issue through a difficult procedural move. Across the U.S. Capitol, the Senate is expected to take it up, though passage in that chamber is far from guaranteed. 
But Democrats, including those in Connecticut, don’t want to stop fighting for an outcome they believe their constituents want, particularly after their strong showing in last week’s elections in the state and across the country.
“I don’t think we can concede defeat just based on what [House Speaker] Mike Johnson is going to do,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said. “I think we keep doing what we’re doing, making sure that the American people know what’s at stake.”
Health care fight continues
In a last-ditch effort, House Democrats are going to use a rarely used — and rarely successful — procedure to force a floor vote as the minority party. By using the vehicle known as a discharge petition, Democrats will need to garner 218 signatures to secure a vote on a three-year extension of the subsidies.
That means they’ll need at least a few Republicans to sign on, which will be a tough sell.  Some moderate Republicans, however, have been supportive of a one-year subsidies extension through a bipartisan bill.
Senate GOP leadership promised to hold a vote on the ACA enhanced subsidies by the second week of December, but it’s unclear if enough Republican senators would support such a measure. If all Senate Democrats backed the bill, they would need to sway seven GOP senators to get it to clear the 60-vote threshold.
It’s even more unlikely the House will take it up before the subsidies expire at the end of next month. A vote in the House wasn’t part of the shutdown deal, and Speaker  Johnson hasn’t made any commitments.
“I’m not promising anybody anything. I’m going to let this process play out,” Johnson said at a recent press conference.
Connecticut Democrats have vowed to keep pushing for an extension of the subsidies if the effort fails next month. 
Congress could be grappling with these same issues early next year since short-term funding for most government agencies runs out by the end of January. If lawmakers can’t pass the rest of the full-year appropriations bills, they would need to once again rely on another funding patch known as a continuing resolution.
“When we come to Jan. 30, we will see what progress has been made. Johnson said he won’t guarantee a vote in the House. The Senate says they will have a vote. Do I trust any of them? Hell no,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, said.
As the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, DeLauro plays a major role in negotiating the remaining nine spending bills and has a little over two months to hash out an agreement with Republican lawmakers on the committee.
With the House on recess for more than 50 days, DeLauro said they lost critical time on negotiations. And there’s not much time left in the year given the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
“Fifty four days, we could have been working on appropriations bills. We have nine more bills to go,” DeLauro said. “So we will see. My concern is that we’re going to be here in the same situation on Jan. 30.”
That leaves little time for work on appropriations and Democrats’ push for a subsidies extension with the next funding deadline set for Jan. 30.
“We should have been working on this literally every day before now. We should have been working on this when we knew the subsidies were going to expire,” Hayes said. “We could have had bipartisan conversations.”
“I think that we’re going to still be fighting. I know that I’m going to keep fighting to try to get these health care subsidies for my constituents,” she continued. “I’m hoping that we don’t end up in another shutdown situation because people know how devastating that is, but that means we gotta work every day until then.”
No funding for Columbia-class subs
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, noted the omission of funding for the Columbia-class submarine program as another red flag. He said the Senate “dropped the ball” on that front in the negotiations, particularly with the House out of town for the past 54 days.
When Congress passes short-term bills like continuing resolutions that keep most government functions running at current funding levels, lawmakers can use what’s known as “anomalies” to make adjustments to funding levels. 
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said that program has gotten anomalies in past budgets because it is viewed as a top priority for the U.S. Navy. And he noted that the White House had submitted its request for an anomaly of about $3.9 billion for the Columbia-class submarines, but it was left out of both the original short-term bill and the one that just passed the House.
“They made a judgment call that it was such a short-duration [continuing resolution] that it was not really as critical to have an anomaly for it,“ Courtney said, referring to the original short-term bill that funded the government through Nov. 21.  “But now we’re talking Jan. 30, and that’s where the Navy’s request really made sense if you were going to treat this as the priority program which it always has been given.” 
The continuing resolution, however, included anomaly funding for the Virginia-class submarine program. 
Electric Boat is the lead contractor on the nuclear-powered ballistic missile vessels to replace the Groton-based company’s Ohio-class submarines. It works alongside Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia on the construction of those subs. Both of those companies work on the Virginia-class program.
The goal of the Navy is to produce two Virginia-class and one Columbia-class a year, though there are delays in the production cadence impacting that goal, according to a March report from the Congressional Research Service.
“There was an assumption that they were going to do an anomaly for it, and it’s zero,” Courtney said. “To me, it just shows not having the House here and just letting these senators who, in my opinion, didn’t pay attention to the priority of keeping schedule, given the age of those boats, that’s what happens.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25316821370012-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

The state’s hospital-rate setting commission gave an overview Wednesday of some of the terms laid out in a future agreement with federal officials to transition the state into a federal program called the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
There are still some details to work out, some that may take several years to complete, officials said. But the new model will let the state retain some of the authority it has now to set rates and global budgets for hospitals, even if there is more federal involvement than in the prior system.
“This is going to be an ongoing discussion,” Jonathan Kromm, executive director for the Health Services Cost Review Commission, said at the Wednesday meeting. “With a two-year time window before some significant changes happen.”
The comments come as the finalized AHEAD model is expected to be signed in the near future.
Caution AHEAD: State officials nervous for Maryland hospitals under Trump administration

Maryland’s current system, called the Total Cost of Care model, allows the state to set annual payments to hospitals in advance but includes patient outcome goals — reducing readmissions, for example — as incentives.
With that system ending this year, state health officials have been working out a new system with federal agencies. Maryland was one of the first states, with Vermont, selected by the Biden administration last year to implement the new AHEAD model.
The federal AHEAD program is actually modeled on Maryland’s Total Cost of Care system and took inspiration from similar models in Vermont and Pennsylvania.
Gov. Wes Moore signed an agreement with Biden administration officials last November on terms of the AHEAD model, but the incoming Trump administration put that plan on hold so it could take another look at the model agreement and make some changes.
The state has been negotiating with officials at the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) on the revised AHEAD model since February. The parties appear to be near an agreement, as the HSCRC is now mapping out what policy changes are ahead for the commission.
One of the major changes is that Maryland will likely lose its ability to set Medicare rates, an authority that’s been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by CMMI.
In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the HSCRC now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.
Draft terms of the revised AHEAD model indicate that Maryland is set to lose the authority to set Medicare rates. That could have ripple effects on rates for Medicaid and private insurance, due to the state’s all-payer model that aims to keep costs for health care consistent across the board, according to health care advocates.
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

That said, the new agreement seems to also prompt Maryland to “stabilize” the state’s uniquely challenging Medicare Advantage market.
Insurance carriers say that Maryland’s current hospital system is costly for them to do business in. This is leading to several carriers pulling out of the state or reducing their coverage, kicking thousands of retirees off their health care plans in the process.
The revised agreement still aims to track population health as the previous agreement had, but adds a new emphasis on finding new ways to enhance choice and competition in the health care market. The HSCRC is also expected to “determine services that could be carved out of global budgets” while still meeting population health goals and hospital revenues.
As the state moves closer to this change, HSCRC Commissioner ​Nicki McCann said it will be an opportunity to track the effectiveness of the state’s hospital model going forward.
“What we’re doing is meaningless if we’re not improving the health of Marylanders, and so I think this is critically important to measure success of this over the long term,” she said during the meeting.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/ct-emergency-relief-fund-lamont-legislature/,Vanishing federal subsidies and stricter benefits rules threaten health care and nutrition aid for thousands of Connecticut households now.,"This story has been updated.
The state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a $500 million emergency fund late Wednesday to bolster social service programs threatened by the longest federal government shutdown in national history.
The House voted 126-20 to approve the bill following a two-and-a-half-hour debate, with 28 out of 48 Republicans siding with all 98 Democrats to back the measure. Because creating the emergency fund potentially could push Connecticut over its budgetary spending cap, the measure had to pass with at least a 60% majority, which meant at least 90 supportive votes in the House.
But given that the 43-day shutdown is nearing its end, the House debate was more a prelude of a larger discussion expected to continue for years: Should Connecticut tap its wealth to temper the deep, longer-lasting cuts to federal human service programs ordered last July by President Trump and Congress?
While many cutbacks to Medicaid don’t start for two more years, vanishing federal subsidies and stricter benefits rules threaten health care and nutrition aid for thousands of Connecticut households now.
“This bill is really about our job to protect our families, particularly in the wake of Washington’s failure to act,” said Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, who added the shutdown “has wreaked havoc on households across our state.”
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the finance committee, who voted for the bill, said, “Our politicians in D.C., on both sides of the aisle, ought to be ashamed of themselves.”
But as Congress late Wednesday approved a temporary federal funding measure — allowing the shutdown to end in the coming days — Polletta added that, “I don’t think there’s going to be a need for this fund.”
“This government shutdown has ended,” said Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “At the end of the day, this bill is not necessary at all.”
The measure before the Democratic-controlled state House would set aside one-fifth of last fiscal year’s historic $2.5 billion state budget surplus to aid those harmed by the shutdown — or by any other federal budget cuts — between now and the end of the state’s fiscal year on June 30, 2026.
The state Senate, where Democrats also hold a majority, will debate the emergency fund Thursday.
Gov. Ned Lamont, who already has announced his support for the measure, could tap this $500 million pool to bolster the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and six other human service programs. These include: a second nutrition assistance program that serves women, infants and children; school meals; winter heating and energy assistance; Medicaid; and federal child care and housing assistance grants.
Any of the $500 million that remains unspent by July 1 of next year would be used to retire Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, which exceeded $35 billion entering last fiscal year, according to Lamont’s budget office.
Is CT response fund needed with federal shutdown ending?
But just as Polletta and Mastrofrancesco questioned the need for any state intervention once the federal government shutdown has ended, others said Connecticut needs to do more for years to come — unless Washington reverses a dangerous trend of cutting back aid to states.
“The fact is that so many working people throughout this state struggled — prior to the federal shutdown, prior to the federal budget cuts,” said Rep. Brandon Chafee, D-Middletown.
“I know people in my community that are going hungry,” said Rep. Anthony Nolan, a Democrat from New London, one of the state’s poorest communities. “I know people in my community that are watering down milk to make milk last longer.”
“For people to say that there are no emergencies,” Nolan added, “that is ridiculous.”
The Trump administration since last spring has used a host of legal maneuvers to block health care, education, nutrition and other federal aid to Connecticut.
Majority Democrats in the General Assembly also began talking — months before any federal government shutdown — about tapping Connecticut’s coffers to offset the big cuts in federal assistance pursued by President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, ordered more than $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief — breaks aimed chiefly at high-earning households.
The bulk of those spending cuts involved Medicaid, an omnibus program that supports medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home care. It also supports hospitals and federally qualified health centers that treat uninsured and underinsured patients.
Congress and Trump also imposed stricter work requirements that could remove about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness from SNAP eligibility in Connecticut between Dec. 1 and March 31.
And starting Jan. 1, Washington will cancel subsidies that help people afford health coverage through through state-based insurance exchanges like Access Health CT. The cost to consumers here is projected at almost $300 million per year.
“Do we want to start thinking about hiring more people to make sure we can deal with Medicaid changes?” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, asked during a Wednesday morning press conference. “Do we want to put more money to Medicaid, potentially? How do you want to deal with SNAP benefits and the reductions that we’ve seen there?”
State Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said last week Connecticut should immediately explore options to help families cope with a huge, impending jump in health insurance costs.
But tempering ongoing federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and health insurance subsidies likely would require state appropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars year after year — not just diverting dollars from a temporary, $500 million emergency fund.
Many Democrats in the General Assembly have said Connecticut easily could afford to help. The state has used aggressive budget caps and savings rules in place since 2017 to force annual surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion over the past eight years. That’s a total currently represents more than 8% of the General Fund.
Those surpluses, created by drawing dollars from health care, education, municipal aid and other core programs, have been used to retire state pension debt faster than Connecticut has in the past. But analysts say, even at this aggressive pace, that debt won’t be eliminated until well into the 2040s.
“It’s time that we re-examined how we do our budget in this state,” Chafee said, adding that asking one generation to solve a debt problem created by three is unfair. “We’re asking the current generation of taxpayers to pay off the whole bill. It’s ridiculous while people are struggling.”
Leaders of the General Assembly’s Republican minority said last week that Connecticut should tap its reserves to assist the state’s roughly 360,000 SNAP recipients who lost benefits when the shutdown entered its second month on Nov. 1. Lamont, who originally was reluctant to commit state dollars to fund those benefits, agreed to do so last Friday, and payments to households resumed Saturday.
Now, with the federal shutdown expected to end, not all Republicans in the state House said Connecticut can afford to drop its guard.
State House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford pledged to support the $500 million response fund during a press conference prior to the House debate.
“What we are doing today points to a failure at the federal level,” Candelora said. “And we cannot have government holding individuals hostage to try to get what they want — either party — and it’s something in Connecticut we don’t do.”
Will Lamont tap CT’s coffers to protect social services, health care?
But Lamont will play a huge role in whether Connecticut taps it coffers — for even a few months, let alone for years to come — to replace vanishing federal aid for social services.
According to the legislation the state House passed, Lamont has sole authority to propose expenditures from that pool. But a 6-member panel of state legislative leaders — which includes the House and Senate majority and minority leaders along with the House speaker and Senate president pro tem — can block any spending with a simple majority vote.
The governor already has been using small amounts of funds from the state’s basic pool of operating cash, to replace stalled federal funding for nutrition assistance for women, infants and children and also for heating assistance. Connecticut had commitments from the Trump administration that Washington would reimburse any state dollars advanced in these areas after the shutdown.
In other words, that won’t cost the state anything.
Lamont did pledge last Friday to commit as much as $72 million in state funds, if necessary, to cover November SNAP benefits stalled by the shutdown. But he did so only after hundreds of thousands of SNAP recipients here already had gone one week with no benefits — and amid public appeals from legislative leaders from both parties.
The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would cover the November SNAP benefits costs promptly after the shutdown ends, Politico reported.
A fiscally moderate Democrat, Lamont has traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
When asked last week whether he would support a state-funded SNAP benefit to protect the 36,000 recipients affected by new work requirements, the governor said only that officials would consider it.
Will SNAP crisis boost support for universal free school meals?
Also Wednesday, advocates for Connecticut funding free school breakfast and lunch for all students said they hoped to use the recent SNAP crisis to build support for their cause.
Representatives of End Hunger CT and the American Heart Association appealed to state legislators to consider funding the service when the 2026 session resumes in slightly less than three months.
“The crisis over SNAP funding has highlighted the very real problem of food insecurity here in Connecticut,” said Amari Brantley, policy coordinator for End Hunger CT. “The restoration of federal funding is welcome, but Connecticut cannot ignore the working families who will continue to fall through the cracks.
Connecticut had offered free meals during the 2023-24 academic year but pulled back due to state budget constraints.
Advocates for universal free meals have said Connecticut could offset most or all costs of the program by establishing a sales tax surcharge on sweetened beverages.
“We know that one of the most effective solutions to food insecurity is feeding all the kids at school and we are encouraging lawmakers to support funding in the 2026 session,” Brantley added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_SpecialSession_004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

(Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)Joe Belvedere has seen many people go through the Veteran Treatment Court, a voluntary program  designed to help vets charged with misdemeanors to get back on their feet. But the story of one veteran from a few years back sticks out.
He came to the program facing substance abuse issues, homelessness, unemployment and had no ties with his family — he had “burned a lot of bridges,” in the words of Belvedere, the case manager and veteran mentor coordinator for the District Court in Anne Arundel County. But he graduated from the program and is now thriving as a master electrician who has been reunited with his family.
“He’s just one of so many who have come through the program,” said Belvedere, noting that the “overwhelming majority” of veterans in the program have faced similar challenges.

There have been 135 veterans who have graduated from the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court since its inception in 2015, including five who graduated Wednesday during the treatment court’s 10th anniversary celebration in Baltimore. The program typically takes 18 months to complete. Over the 10 years the program has been in place, there have been 24 unsuccessful graduations.
“Anybody who works in the criminal justice system knows that those kinds of numbers are astounding,” said District Court Senior Judge Halee F. Weinstein, the founder of the program and a veteran herself. “But they are not just numbers — they are people.”
The court originally only served veterans from Baltimore City, and now has been open to veterans from Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties for about a year. The central Maryland program has 44 active participants — about twice as many as last year, when it expanded to a regional court.
“That is double the amount of veterans who have had the ability to rebuild their lives,” said Belvedere, who will soon assume his role as a veteran mentor coordinator for both the District Court in Anne Arundel and the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court.
Belvedere hopes that the decision to expand will be an example for other court programs, emphasizing that this is “just the beginning.” He noted the “ripple effects” the program has in the community, such as multigenerational impacts and the ways in which veterans who have completed the program give back to the community — some becoming veteran mentors themselves or finding other ways to use their experience to help others.
Veteran treatment programs are offered in 13 counties across the state through the District Court in Anne Arundel County, the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court, the Dorchester County District Regional Veterans Court, the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County and the Frederick and Washington County Regional Veterans Treatment Court.
“I’d like to thank the judge for offering grace — if that’s what it is — to veterans who need the time to reflect on their lives,” said retired Army Col. Edna W. Cummings, who spoke at the ceremony.

Cummings encouraged veterans to write down stories from their service, pushing each of them to reflect on the significance of the role they played in leading a unit or organization to its success.
“I like to think that the military sent each of us to a superpower training camp — it’s designed to bring out our strengths we didn’t know we had,”  she said. “Once you document your story, you too will realize your superpowers.”
Program graduates on Wednesday each approached the front of the room to share words with Weinstein, with whom the veterans had regular status hearings during their time in the program. Each veteran shared a moment, complete with both laughs and emotional sentiments, with their mentor and Weinstein before taking a photo in front of the flag that represented their respective service.
“I get to look at not the person who I was, but the person I became as a result of using drugs and getting into all that negative stuff. Now I get to be the person I truly am — who I was raised to be,” said Kevin Johnson, a veteran who graduated Wednesday. “It’s just a really good feeling to be able to feel this way.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to stay two lower court orders requiring her to set earlier special election dates for two legislative vacancies Wednesday evening.

Arkansas judge rules against Sanders in second special election lawsuit

The identical orders, which did not explain the justices’ reasoning, granted the state’s motions for expedited consideration of its appeals of the orders handed down by two Pulaski County Circuit judges last month. Associate Justice Rhonda Wood would have granted the request for a faster briefing schedule, according to the order. Associate Justice Barbara Webb did not participate.
“I am disappointed by the rulings and will continue to vigorously defend the Governor and Secretary of State,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said via a spokesperson. Griffin’s office is representing Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in both lawsuits.
Sanders set special elections for the Senate District 26 and House District 27 seats earlier this year, after Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch died and Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock resigned to lead Arkansas PBS in September.. However, her decision to set the special elections for June 2026 — after the Legislature’s fiscal session in April — immediately generated bipartisan criticism and lawsuits from SD 26 and HD 70 voters, as well as the Democratic Party of Arkansas, who said it would deprive them of representation for important legislative deliberations on issues like education and prison funding.
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
‘Far-reaching ramifications’: Judge says special election dates violate constitutional rights

A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Judges in both lawsuits sided with the plaintiffs and ordered Sanders to schedule the elections earlier, finding that the June 2026 dates were impermissible under state law and the U.S. and Arkansas constitutions, though the reasoning varied between the cases. In the HD 70 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson explicitly ordered Sanders to set the general special election for March 3, 2026. In the SD 26 case, Judge Patricia James said Sanders needed to set it “as soon as practicable” after the 150-day deadline, but did not specify when.
Sanders subsequently appealed those orders to the Arkansas Supreme Court, asking the justices to consolidate the cases into a single appeal and put the lower court decisions on hold.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AR-SUPREME-CT-JCSR9975.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

As expected, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo on Wednesday issued the proclamation calling legislators to convene in Carson City at 10 a.m. Thursday.
Lombardo will also be asking legislators to pass a crime bill he championed during the regular session of the Legislature earlier this year. Like the film tax credit proposal, the crime bill met its demise as the regular session was winding down. Both measures have been publicly discussed for months as likely items during a legislative special session. 
Another half dozen laws that failed to make it across the finish line when the regular session ended in June will also be making a reappearance before lawmakers, including a bill that aims to relieve Nevada’s health care provider shortage, a juvenile safety bill, and some statutory housekeeping measures.
Lombardo’s proclamation also includes what is for a special session a large number of other issues, ranging from cybersecurity prevention to school zone safety to fire trucks for the state Division of Forestry.
“Nevadans deserve action now – not years from now – on legislation that implements critical public safety measures, expands healthcare access, and supports good-paying jobs,” Lombardo said in a press release accompanying the proclamation.

States like New York and Vermont have also taken a hard look at their emissions mandates in light of clean energy shortfalls.,"OF ALL THE impacts President Trump is having on Massachusetts, one of the most significant is the constraints he is putting on our efforts to bring clean energy online. From canceled wind contracts to ending tax credits, almost overnight the Commonwealth has found itself confronting a new reality when it comes to energy and climate ambitions – and a new bill in the House is poised to help us confront that reality. 
Massachusetts has certainly led on climate over the years. Beginning with passage of the Green Communities Act and Global Warming Solutions Act in 2008, the Commonwealth has addressed greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation. With increasingly aggressive emissions mandates—a 50 percent reduction by 2030, 75 percent by 2040 and net zero by 2050—the state has dramatically expanded energy efficiency programs and encouraged the development of solar, geothermal, energy storage, and offshore wind – while transitioning away from natural gas to a system that relies primarily on electricity.  
Unfortunately, even as the dates for these mandates get closer, they remain unrealized. Today, only about a quarter of Massachusetts’s electricity is renewable – more than half of which comes from not solar or offshore wind power but the burning of wood and waste.  
Meanwhile, offshore wind projects that would provide enough energy to power more than a million homes—Southcoast Wind (1,100 megawatts) and New England Wind I (800 megawatts)—have been delayed and now contract negotiations are not expected to be completed until next year at the earliest, with new energy solicitations being put on hold. In fact, only two large clean energy projects are under construction: the 1,200 megawatt transmission line delivering hydropower from Canada, and the 800 megawatt Vineyard Wind 1 offshore wind project – neither of which will move the needle on greenhouse gas emissions within the next five years.  
So, as the Legislature considers Gov. Healey’s energy affordability bill, the question becomes: Do Massachusetts leaders need to re-think our 2030 emissions mandates? 
Rep. Mark Cusack, who leads House energy policy as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, has introduced legislation to shift Massachusetts’s 2030 emissions target from a mandate to advisory goal – maintaining the 2050 net-zero objective, while allowing flexibility to protect households and businesses. His bill would also address rising energy costs, in part by creating an affordability and competitiveness standard to ensure the Commonwealth’s emissions efforts will not impose unreasonable adverse impacts on the cost or availability of energy.  
The longer we wait, the harder it’s going to be. In part, that’s because policies designed to incentivize zero emissions fuels and constrain our use of natural gas and leave us increasingly dependent on the one fuel everyone agrees Massachusetts shouldn’t be using: oil.  
While we all remember the spike in energy costs from last winter, less attention was paid to the negative climate impact during the coldest days when gas was in short supply. On January 22, 2025, the region required 20,000 megawatts of electricity to meet demand – the most all season. Cold winter spikes in electric use are not unusual. What was unusual is that about 30 percent of the electricity used this time was not generated by clean sources or even natural gas, but by oil. Greenhouse gas emissions averaged around 137 metric tons per minute.  
Only a year earlier, when the region’s peak electricity demand reached 18,300 megawatts on January 17, 2024, emissions averaged about 85 metric tons per minute most of the day. Why? Because natural gas was available. In a single year, a 10 percent increase in electricity usage drove up emissions by 60 percent.  
With ratepayer-funded rebates encouraging installation of up to 500,000 heat pumps—which cost between $20,000 to $30,000 apiece—adding stress to our already overburdened electricity grid, the problem will only get worse and more expensive.  
As bad as this all sounds—and it is bad—Gov. Healey is smart to leave all options on the table. 
Last month her administration announced a partnership with the University of Massachusetts Lowell to accelerate the state’s leadership in advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Additionally, she reiterated her commitment to an “all-of-the above” approach to energy resources, specifically noting that natural gas “continues to play an important role in our overall energy supply.” 
Massachusetts isn’t the only progressive state reassessing this challenge. States like New York and Vermont have also taken a hard look at their emissions mandates in light of clean energy shortfalls. Even California is rethinking its environmental codes in light of housing construction shortfalls. They recognize that increasing costs with little or no practical emission reduction is not only counterproductive but—with a hostile Administration in Washington—an increasingly urgent issue to address.  
For more than a decade, Massachusetts climate strategy has effectively traded higher emissions, higher costs, and less reliability today for a promise of lower emissions tomorrow. But a promise is far from a guarantee – and with 2030 almost upon us, tomorrow still isn’t here.

(Photo by Ian Karbal/The Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The last state in the nation without some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year finally has a spending plan in place.
Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a $50.1 billion state budget Wednesday after intensive meetings between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in recent weeks. They had been deadlocked for nearly five months since the June 30 deadline. 
The budget, Shapiro’s third, increases overall spending by 4.7% compared to the previous year but represents a $1.4 billion reduction from his proposal in February. 
Before signing the bills that make up the spending plan, Shapiro noted leaders from the House and Senate had worked through the summer and fall and rejected calls by some Republicans to slash healthcare spending and other critical programs.

“We stayed at the table. We refused to accept inaction,” Shapiro said. “Because my top priority has been delivering a budget that makes a meaningful impact on the good people of Pennsylvania.” 
Shapiro stressed that the spending plan is balanced, reduces taxes and preserves the state’s roughly $7 billion rainy day fund. 
It continues a phased reduction in the state’s corporate net income tax to 7.49% and provides a state earned income tax credit for low- and moderate-income families that will provide $193 million in tax relief. It also projects that the state will end this fiscal year with $8 billion in its rainy day fund.
In a major concession for some Democrats, Republican lawmakers won a long-sought policy goal by getting Shapiro to withdraw from a regional greenhouse gas reduction program they likened to a tax on energy and a drag on economic growth in the commonwealth. And it includes reforms to environmental permitting that advocates say make Pennsylvania more business friendly.

“This budget took much longer than expected but ultimately Senate Republicans held the line to keep our promise to the people of Pennsylvania by not raising taxes and ensuring our state savings account – the rainy day fund – was not attacked,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward said. “It is important for Pennsylvanians to know this budget is the direct result of a divided government and two very different approaches to how we govern our state and partner with the federal government.”
Ward added Senate Republicans compromised by agreeing to spend more than the $47.6 billion they proposed in August.
House Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said before the vote that although the budget was late, it reflects the shared interests of rural, urban and suburban Pennsylvanians.
“This budget represents us coming together to recognize that while everyone may not have gotten everything, that we can work together collectively … to have a document that we can be proud of that delivers on the promises that many of us have made to the people,” Harris said.
It passed the House with a 156-47 vote and a 40-9 tally in the Senate.
“This budget builds on the progress we’ve made to be able to deliver better schools and more opportunity for our kids, because I believe every single child deserves the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed,” Shapiro said.

It continues an increase in funding to put the commonwealth’s most underfunded schools on an equal footing while enacting reforms to control what taxpayers must spend for privately run cyber charter schools. The state’s 500 school districts will receive $785 million or 7.5% more compared to the 2024-2025 budget.
That includes an additional $565 million in adequacy funding to address a state court’s finding that the reliance on property taxes to fund education put students in less wealthy communities at a disadvantage. The program will be expanded to ensure every district receives at least $50,000, although a majority will receive more to make up for decades of funding disparity.
“This budget shows bipartisan consensus that the march to constitutional school funding is not optional. It took too long, but we moved one year closer to a system that will transform lives,” Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, senior attorney with the Public Interest Law Center that helped win the lawsuit over education funding, said.
School districts will also be permitted to deduct more from the per-pupil tuition they’re required to pay for students who attend online charter schools. It’s estimated the changes will reduce the cost by an estimated $178 million statewide. 
Other cyber charter school reforms include a requirement for teachers to see and communicate with students at least once a week to help ensure student welfare in the wake of several child abuse cases that went unnoticed because the children weren’t attending school in person.
Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters PA, said the reforms are a “significant step toward reining in wasteful spending by the cyber charter industry and creating accountability for cyber operators to ensure that their students are supported, safe, and actually attending school.”

Republican leaders said Wednesday after the budget bills passed that enacting policies to foster economic and job growth, such as the withdrawal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), are essential to the sustainability of state government. 
“We would be in a situation in a couple years where we simply would not have the money to fund any budget that is anywhere close to what we have now, let alone increases in the future,” House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said in a news conference.
RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade.
But Topper and other Republicans have said the program, which former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered by executive order in 2019, restrained the state’s ability to make use of its vast natural gas resources. Pennsylvania’s participation in the program has been on hold as state courts sorted out challenges questioning whether it is constitutional.
Environmentalists spoke out against abandoning RGGI last week as it became clear the program was a bargaining chip in ongoing negotiations. Amanda Leland, managing director at EDF Action, said Wednesday the compromise needlessly abandoned a promising tool for lowering energy costs and cutting pollution.
“Pennsylvanians are calling for cleaner air, lower energy bills and a responsible state budget — not for their governor to lock the state into dirty, expensive energy sources of the past,” Leland said.
Shapiro said he still plans to pursue an alternative plan that keeps energy investments by carbon emitters in the commonwealth and positions the state as an energy exporter. But Topper told the Capital-Star that no programs similar to RGGI would get consideration in the General Assembly.
“We’re trying to address costs,” he said. “I do not believe that natural gas development is a threat to the environment. So, no, I don’t think anything needs to happen to replace it,” Topper said.
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said the permitting reforms that are included in the budget package are also essential to Pennsylvania improving its competitiveness. They would streamline the Department of Environmental Protection’s review process for air and water quality impacts and require the agency to meet deadlines or permits would be automatically approved. 
Pittman pointed to an announcement Wednesday by Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel that it plans to build a new plant in Arkansas.
“The governor of Arkansas made the comment at the time that we put shovels in the ground faster than Pennsylvania issues permits,” Pittman said. “That type of bureaucracy is not acceptable. And so what we have done here has completely changed the paradigm.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Voters who did not follow a new Montana law requiring electors write their birth year on the envelope of an absentee ballot had the chance to fix the issue if they responded to a call, mailed notice or email from their local election department, but thousands of ballots still ended up in the rejected pile when all the counting was finalized. 
According to the Secretary of State’s office, “only one percent” of ballots were rejected due to a missing or mismatched birth year. However, some counties had rejection rates significantly higher than one percent, and almost all large counties saw higher rates than previous elections. 
The Secretary of State’s office did not provide any aggregate data showing the statewide rejection rate, and did not respond to several questions from the Daily Montanan about the new process, including specifics about cases of potential fraud the office said were prevented due the new law. 
In a press release, the office celebrated a successful election across the state, and the new law which allowed “election officials to efficiently and securely verify each voter.” 
In Yellowstone County, 31,563 ballots were accepted, and 1,400 total ballots were initially rejected, according to election administrator Dayna Causby, nearly 4.5%. 
Of the rejected ballots, roughly 1,100 were rejected due to a missing or incorrect birth year. 
While more than 800 ballots were resolved by voters notified about the error, the rejection rate after all resolutions was 2.03%.
During the last municipal election in 2023, that rate was 0.78%. 
Billings had a mayoral race that was decided by less than 200 votes — while final rejected ballots that were not counted in the election were three times that margin. 
“It was definitely a strain for voters whose ballot was rejected who had to come in and fix that,” Causby told the Daily Montanan. “We’re definitely already strategizing on how to mitigate this for future elections. Not just Yellowstone, but all the counties in the state.”
Outreach about the new law, House Bill 719, varied by county. 
Lewis and Clark County had some of the highest outreach, due to holding a City of Helena primary election a few weeks before the general election. While HB 719 wasn’t officially in effect during that September election, county officials treated it as a way to educate voters on the new changes. 
The work showed, as Lewis and Clark County had the lowest percent of rejected ballots among the most populous counties. 
Just 0.9% of ballots in the county were rejected, according to the election office. 
“Anytime you change the process for voters, even if it’s a minor change, you’re going to want to find a way to tell them about it,” Elections administrator Connor Fitzpatrick told the Daily Montanan leading up to election day. 
Fitzpatrick said the trial run with the primary, combined with sending out mailers to registered voters seemed to do the trick. 
“It looks like our outreach did connect with people,” he said. 
 In Gallatin County, three staff members were tasked with calling voters on Election Day to let them know their ballots had been rejected, but less than half of voters contacted resolved them. 
“We certainly had many more rejections this election, so many more votes didn’t count compared to past municipal elections,” Gallatin County Election Administrator Eric Semerad told the Daily Montanan. “Some of those voters may be upset that their votes were not counted. You can see that 377 voters did resolve their ballots after we contacted them this election, suggesting that voters do value their votes, even in these smaller municipal elections.”
Gallatin County recorded 820 rejected ballots, 626 of which were rejected due to a missing or incorrect birth year. The county’s total rejection rate was 3.74%, and the rejection rate after ballots were resolved was 2.05%.
Semerad said ballots seemed to get better as the election progressed as voters learned about the new process, and he said he thinks elections in 2026 will be better. 
Flathead County held its largest mail-in election ever, and ended up rejecting 663 total ballots, or 2.06%. The ballots rejected due to the birth year was 384. 
After voters had the chance to resolve their ballot issues, the county ended up with a rejection rate of 1.23%. That’s close to double what was seen during the 2024 election, though the county election administrator noted that such a large turnout in a presidential year makes it an inexact comparison. 
In Cascade County, elections were held for the cities of Great Falls and Belt. 
In Great Falls, 166 ballots were missing a year of birth or incorrectly filled out the year of birth out of 309 total rejected ballots for a roughly 1.9% rejection rate. 
The town of Belt saw 28 votes cast for alderman, and three ballots rejected for a missing birth year. 
Cascade County elections specialist Heather Potter said that rejection rates were higher than normal, with data showing that previous years’ rejected ballot numbers were matched by this year’s birth year rejections alone. 
In Ravalli County,the new law showed a limited impact on voters. 
County election administrator Regina Plettenberg said that there were only 17 rejected ballots across three municipal elections, “no more than usual.”
“We didn’t do a lot of outreach before the election, but we did put a very simple notice in with the ballot and it was separate from the regular instructions,” Plettenberg said. “Of course this was a much smaller election in Ravalli County than in some other counties.”
The new law, carried in the Legislature by Columbia Falls Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Republican, was intended to enhance election security by adding a second identification point for voters to provide in addition to a signature that must be matched to county records. 
During the session, Mitchell said that the law is a “common-sense practice,” that aligns absentee voting with in-person requirements.
Montana has had just two known cases of election fraud since 1997, according to the Heritage Foundation’s election fraud tracker. 
The Secretary of State’s office, in a press release, said the recent election was the first “during Secretary (Christi) Jacobsen’s two terms in which no voter had reported a violation of someone else voting on their behalf.”
However, the office did not provide any details about previous cases of fraud during Jacobsen’s previous term.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 20:58:28.231463

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence City Councilor Sue AnderBois formally kicked off her campaign for lieutenant governor Wednesday evening.
She joins a field that already includes Cindy Coyne, a former Democratic state senator who announced in June she would challenge current Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ candidacy.
AnderBois’ event at Providence’s Wild Colonial Tavern began about 20 minutes after its scheduled start time, because she was talking to people as they began pouring into the tavern around 6 p.m. AnderBois continued that thread of goodwill in her remarks, referring to those gathered as her “friends.”
“Friends, I don’t want to be cheesy,” AnderBois said, “We need leadership that not only has a bold vision, but also a real love for the nitty gritty details of getting things done and for the people who do it. We know that some of the best work comes from love and collaboration, not from fear and intimidation.”
Several dozen supporters gathered in the dark, stone-walled pub at the outer edge of Providence’s East Side to support AnderBois, who represents Ward 3 on the capital city’s council, which includes the neighborhoods of Mount Hope, Hope Village, Collyer Park, and Blackstone. 
Joining her at the podium were fellow City Councilor Justin Roias and state Rep. Megan Cotter of Exeter, who are both Democrats. 
“When I was first elected to the Providence City Council, I didn’t know Sue,” Roias said. “But I quickly got to know her well, mostly because she sat right next to me in the council chambers.”
“When one of our colleagues would say something — let’s just call it ‘unexpected’ — Sue and I mastered the art of nonverbal communication,” Roias continued, his comments drawing laughter from the crowd. “We would just exchange that look, the one that says, ‘What on earth did that person just say?’”
Roias said he has got to know AnderBois “beyond those shared side-eye moments,” and that his fellow councilor has taught him “something profound about…government.”
“She has a way of moving through this world, both practical and principled,” Roias said. “And to be honest, I’ve always wrestled with that tension.”
AnderBois was first elected to her City Council seat in November 2022, trouncing rival Michael Fink, an Independent, with nearly 87% of the vote. 
So far in her tenure representing Ward 3, AnderBois has led ordinances to ban gas-powered leaf blowers in the city and steered $5 million in federal and state funds toward safety improvements and repairs along North Main Street. She also led eco-friendly initiatives such as an ordinance that mandates select large buildings to report their energy usage, and a municipal law that strives for carbon-neutrality in all city-owned buildings by 2040. 
AnderBois currently serves as the Council’s deputy majority whip, and she chairs the North Main Street Task Force and Special Committee on Environment & Resiliency. Her day job is director of climate and energy in the northeast division of The Nature Conservancy, a global nonprofit.
“My mom likes to joke that I was born with a to-do list in my hand,” AnderBois told her supporters.

The Rhode Island Constitution prescribes that the Lieutenant Governor replace the governor if they should “die, remove from the state, refuse to serve; become insane, or be otherwise incapacitated.” This has happened only seven times since the Constitution’s ratification in 1842, according to 2021 analysis in the Boston Globe. 
The most recent lieutenant governor to seize the highest office is current Gov. Dan McKee, who took over for Gina Raimondo when she left to work under former president Joe Biden as commerce secretary. Before McKee, the last time a lieutenant governor assumed a vacant governor’s office was in 1951, when John S. McKiernan served for two weeks, after Gov. John Pastore left office early when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
State general laws afford Rhode Island’s lieutenant governor some additional duties, such as chairing the Long-Term Care Coordinating Council, the Emergency Management Advisory Committee, and the Small Business Advocacy Council.
Roias acknowledged that the lieutenant governorship is not the flashiest state office, and he said it’s “notoriously seen as a lame duck position.” 
“But it doesn’t have to be in the right hands,” Roias said. “It can be a platform, a space, to push forward bold ideas, to challenge complacency and to make government actually work for people, and I believe Sue can do exactly that.”
The base salary for the job was $137,510 in the budgets for both fiscal year 2025 and 2026.
The lieutenant governor often gets involved in legislative advocacy as well. Current Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, for instance, has made fairer grocery prices a cornerstone of her legislative agenda since she was nominated by McKee and appointed by the Rhode Island Senate in 2021. Matos resigned from her role as president of the Providence City Council when she assumed the post of lieutenant governor. She held onto the position in the 2022 election.
No independent or Republican candidates have announced their candidacy as of Wednesday.
As of the latest filing on Sept. 30, Coyne’s campaign account trumped that of both her peers, with $69,457. Matos had $45,191 and AnderBois had $24,868.   
The primary will take place on Sept. 8, 2026, followed by the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.

(Photo by Bryan Whitten/UAF Geophysical Institute)A series of solar flares, essentially explosions on the surface of the sun, caused unusually bright and colorful displays of aurora borealis in Alaska and other northern latitudes on Tuesday night.
University of Alaska Fairbanks Physics Professor Mark Conde said he and other researchers expect that atmospheric activity will continue to result in vividly colored displays of aurora, or northern lights, through Wednesday night. He described seeing large, tall swaths of red in the night sky from his home in Fairbanks.
“It was like seeing the fine wine of the aurora,” Conde said. “Deep red aurora is quite unusual, and they only really occur during extreme events like this.”
Aurora borealis is caused by charged particles, mainly protons and electrons, that stream into the Earth’s magnetic field and strike our atmosphere. The reaction essentially paints a picture on the atmosphere that is visible in the night sky.
Recent explosions on the surface of the sun have resulted in highly visible displays of northern lights because those solar flares caused more charged particles to come into contact with the Earth’s atmosphere.

Conde said that as solar winds stream by our atmosphere, they generate electric fields. The Earth’s magnetic field generally deflects particles away from the near-Earth region, but if the solar wind has an opposite magnetic charge, then it can penetrate into the protective bubble of the Earth’s magnetic field, and eventually find its way down to our atmosphere. He said that results in highly visible auroras like what was observable in many parts of the northern hemisphere last night.
“It’s almost like a switch,” he said of the favorably aligned magnetic fields. “(The solar wind) can open the switch and let itself in. And that’s kind of what happened last night, when (the cloud of materials from the solar flare) first hit the magnetic field it was extremely favorable to allow the solar wind to penetrate into the near-Earth environment and pump up the magnetosphere and produce the displays that we saw.”
He said the unusual deep red color of the displays was caused by a large flow of low energy particles that were able to interact with the Earth’s atmosphere.
Many people are drawn to the spectacular visuals of the aurora, but Conde said scientists study it for a more practical reason: The aurora is one aspect of space weather, which has significant effects on modern technology, including satellites and radio communication. 
Conde said he and his colleagues have not yet heard of any big disruptions from this week’s solar flares, but they did disrupt data collection on two spacecraft that university researchers use to monitor the solar wind. He said in past years, solar winds have knocked Starlink internet communication satellites out of orbit, causing them to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere.

The solar flares that are causing such vivid auroras this week can also accelerate radiation that can be harmful to astronauts and spacecraft, Conde said.
“If there was an astronaut standing on the surface of the Moon last night — outside the magnetic, protective bubble of the earth — or en route to Mars, they wouldn’t have been killed, I don’t think, by the radiation, but there would have been enough radiation that they would have had significant health risks,” he said.
Another practical reason for a physicist such as Conde to observe the aurora is that the near-Earth environment is regarded by scientists as a natural laboratory.
“We can look at plasma phenomena occurring in space that we can’t possibly reproduce on Earth because… if you wanted to study those plasma interactions on the ground, you would need a vacuum chamber that would be 100 kilometers in diameter or something,” he said.
He said observations of how Earth interacts with solar wind and the near-Earth environment can help answer questions about the long term evolution of our upper atmosphere. 
“Plus,” he said, “It’s pretty!”

Following the recent resignation of Northfield’s police chief, the town was looking to neighboring Berlin to provide police service in the interim. But Berlin Police Chief James Pontbriand said this week he has no intention of filling the gap without some compensation.
Given how “murky” things are at the Northfield Police Department, “we really don’t want to be a part of that ongoing drama at all,” Pontbriand said at Monday’s selectboard meeting, referring to the town’s struggles maintaining police staff.
Pontbriand, who has served as Berlin’s police chief for more than five years, told VTDigger on Wednesday that Vermont can be a difficult place for out-of-state officers.

The certification process can be “challenging,” and there is no onboarding process for new chiefs who come from other states, he said. Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez faced “a lot of challenges” from the get go, he said.
Gomez, 58, resigned at the end of October. He was hired in September 2023 in the Washington County town after former chief John Helfant retired amid controversy.
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont, Gomez reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town two years ago from Pennsylvania. He further alleged the town, particularly the town manager, did not adequately respond to support him nor deal with the people casting doubt on his work.
Gomez, a Black Latino man, submitted a letter of complaint to the town on April 16. In June, the town paid a private firm $17,000, authorizing a third-party investigation to evaluate ethics violations, according to Northfield Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse. No action has been taken, and none of the findings have been made public. “Ethics complaints are confidential,” Morse said at the time.
Further, the board voted unanimously on Sept. 9 to instruct Town Manager Jeff Schulz and Gomez to meet weekly. Morse said the board “discovered a departure of policy” and felt a standing meeting would help “an overall continuous improvement process in performance management for both leaders.”
In response to VTDigger public records requests, Michael Leddy of McNeil, Leddy & Sheahan claimed in a Sept. 23 letter that documents pertaining to the letter and the investigations are “completely exempt” from being shared, citing several exemptions under state law. The Burlington law firm serves as legal counsel to the town, according to Leddy.
‘A lot of challenges’
When Gomez resigned in September, Pontbriand said they had “spoken frequently” about the problems Gomez faced in town and he was sorry to see him go.
“The Northfield Police Department has been struggling for years and the Chief certainly had an uphill battle from the start,” he wrote in an email to VTDigger last month.
“I think there were a lot of challenges already in place facing him as far as personnel goes and just some of the politics of the town,” Pontbriand said Wednesday. “I don’t want to speak negatively of the governance, but he did share a lot of his frustration trying to make things happen there.”
Pontbriand, who developed a friendship with Gomez, said he found him “knowledgeable and capable, certainly very vocal about the things that he needed.”
Pontbriand also said he is frustrated at the way things are playing out regarding the police assistance Berlin provides, as discussed by the selectboard this week, particularly the lack of communication from Northfield.
“I originally approached the town manager down there, probably at the time that Pierre gave his notice, to propose that, Hey, we’re not going to continue to do this for free,” he said.
An unsigned draft of the Northfield-Berlin intermunicipal police agreement was on Monday’s selectboard meeting agenda. But Pontbriand said he was never contacted by Northfield officials and was concerned “people were under the impression that we were going to take over police services.”
“I myself didn’t see this document until the other night, which caused some confusion within my own agency that we’re completely taking over police services, which we are not,” he said at the meeting, adding that the Berlin selectboard had not seen the memo either.
“There is no signed police coverage agreement and there has never been,” Pontbriand said Wednesday.
Police staffing issues 
In the past, Berlin police responded as a courtesy when Vermont State Police were unavailable to provide backup to Northfield. State Police has faced severe staffing shortages in recent years, curtailing its ability to assist local police departments. State Police were not immediately available for comment.
The Washington County town of Northfield, with a population of about 6,000, has a small police department consisting of a chief and one full-time officer. It has an estimated annual budget of almost $35,000, according to the town. 
About 14 miles north, Berlin has a larger police force consisting of a chief and nine officers serving a population of about 2,500 and a commercial corridor, according to Pontbriand, who said Monday he expects Northfield will lean more heavily on Berlin for police response in the absence of a police chief. 
“I wanted to make sure that we receive some benefit for applying the service,” he said at Monday’s meeting. “We would only come if State Police are not available. I just want to make that clear. So we’d be the third in line: Northfield, State Police, and then us if no one else is available.”
Pontbriand estimated Berlin police respond to Northfield calls about twice a month. After Gomez’s departure, for example, a Berlin police officer responded to an early morning fire that involved a person trapped inside the residence and a person with a weapon threatening first responders outside, Pontbriand said, resulting in three hours of overtime. But Berlin has never received compensation for police coverage in the past. 
“We’d be willing to assist … on a case by case basis,” Pontbriand said. “There will be a cost associated with that, but I don’t expect it to be a frequent thing.” 
Northfield has a smaller police department with limited capabilities. It currently has a Level 2 officer on staff — Sgt. Brian Gosselin — who is limited in scope on what he can respond to. A Level 2 certified officer cannot, for instance, investigate felonies or conduct death investigations, according to Pontbriand.
Certified Level 2 officers have a minimum of 30 hours of training per year, while certified Level 3 officers have more intensive training, per state requirements. Gomez was certified Level 3.
Northfield residents have voiced concerns at recent meetings about inadequate police coverage given the department’s current staffing woes, particularly since Gomez left. Gosselin said Monday he has a backlog of cases and needs help.
Pontbriand said the town needs to install “an experienced law enforcement officer” to supervise the police department in the interim. While Gosselin is “very capable,” Pontbriand said he is limited by state statutes.
Gomez, who virtually attended Monday’s meeting, said Gosselin has the training to be a good interim until the town can hire a new police chief, and suggested that the town listen and support him. Gomez said he discussed the police coverage agreement a month ago and asked the town manager for answers.
The selectboard discussed potentially formalizing the service Berlin provides and providing some compensation to the neighboring police department, as suggested by the chief. Gosselin suggested paying Berlin for the felony-type cases he cannot cover.
“They have a lot of questions, which is fine and understandable,” Pontbriand said.
The board also discussed advertising the police chief position. Gosselin recommended reaching out to veteran officers with good experience, good reputation and clean records who are interested in leadership positions and building up a police department.Schulz, the Northfield town manager who is set to retire next year, did not respond this week to queries about the process and timeline for filling the vacant police chief spot, nor whether the town has received any applications or letters of interest. 
“I do not know if the manager has received letters of interest from any one,” Morse said in an email Tuesday.
However, Morse confirmed former police chief Helfant, who earlier this year surrendered his law enforcement certification, has recommended the town hire Norwich Police Chief Matthew Romei, who was formerly the Capitol Police chief.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., doubled down while speaking to reporters in Columbia Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, on a long-shot proposal to halt congressional pay in the case of any future government shutdown. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As a restart of the federal government appears imminent, Sen. Lindsey Graham is doubling down on a long-shot proposal to change the Constitution to halt congressional pay in any future shutdown.
The South Carolina Republican introduced the constitutional amendment two weeks ago that would force members of Congress to forfeit their paychecks entirely, automatically sending their pay to the Treasury if lawmakers again fail to keep the government funded.
“If I never do anything else in this job, I’m gonna push the hell out of this,” Graham said while speaking to reporters in Columbia Wednesday.
The shutdown that began Oct. 1 became the longest in United States history as senators failed 14 times to reach the required 60-vote threshold needed to clear the way for approval of a stopgap funding agreement. A 15th vote succeeded late Sunday after Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting to advance the legislation. Expected approval by the U.S. House could reopen the government as early as Thursday.
Under federal law, the president, Congress and federal judges all receive regular paychecks when the government shuts down due to lack of funding. But unlike the lawmakers that allowed it to happen, the country’s 2 million civilian government employees and thousands of congressional staffers go without pay until the government reopens.
SC congressional delegation donating, pausing paychecks amid government shutdown

Members of Congress have the choice to receive their pay as normal, donate it to charity, give the money back to the Treasury to buy down the federal debt, or have their checks withheld. Those who opt to withhold get backpay when the shutdown ends, similar to other federal workers.
Graham opted to donate the $20,700 he received over the last month and a half to Upstate Warrior Solutions. He cut the check to the Greenville-based veterans charity on Tuesday, he said.
South Carolina’s senior senator voted consistently over the 43-day shutdown to reopen the government. But he acknowledged that Republicans caused a 35-day shutdown in late December 2018 through mid-January 2019 in a push for money to build a wall along the country’s southern border.
“But what I’ve learned from this experience, if you’ve got a policy debate, don’t shut down the government to get an outcome,” he said. “That’s not a good way to legislate.”
The Constitution prevents Congress from changing its own pay rules. Lawmakers can only make changes that impact future congressional sessions. So, a constitutional amendment would be the best option, Graham argued.
In the U.S. House, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina’s 5th District has introduced a similar measure. The Rock Hill Republican has said he will also donate his pay during the shutdown.
The measure stands little chance of success. The amendment process requires two-thirds majority approval in each chamber, then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
Still, Graham hasn’t backed down.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Regents wasn’t ready to call for any hard and fast decisions when it came to potential tuition guarantee programs Wednesday, having received a report on how they’ve worked at other institutions and potential impacts on Iowa universities.
A tuition guarantee program locks in a student’s tuition their first year, ensuring the cost won’t increase as they continue through their undergraduate education.
Board Chief Business Officer Brad Berg worked with Regent Christine Hensley and former Regent David Barker to develop a report on tuition guarantee programs. The Iowa Legislature passed legislation this year requiring study of the topic and the board this spring assigned the group to conduct the work.
“Implementation of a tuition guarantee program would require careful system planning and testing and establishment of clear policies and ongoing coordination and communication with students and families,” Berg said.

When combining sources of income for Iowa’s public universities, Berg said the breakdown falls at 20% resident undergraduate tuition, 30% state appropriations and the rest coming from tuition from other groups, such as nonresident and graduate students.
Traditionally, when state funding decreases, tuition then increases, and Berg said tax reductions from the state could lead to funding uncertainty in the future. The report also stated that federal actions have caused even more uncertainty in areas of research and student financial aid.
“Given the historical variability in Iowa’s higher education funding, implementing a tuition guarantee policy without a stable funding base could lead to unintended consequences, potentially limiting the ability of the state’s public universities to adapt to fluctuations in state support, inflation and rising operational costs,” the report stated.
Berg said there are also technical considerations when considering implementing a tuition guarantee, like whether software would need to be replaced and certain programs changed. Each of the universities uses a different system for tuition payments and houses academic programs with unique tuition costs, and students often change their majors or make other moves that impact their bills.
The study group examined tuition guarantee programs across the U.S. for the report, including Drake University in Des Moines. Results were mixed on their success, Berg said, with some discontinuing their programs due to budget shortfalls after economic downturns caused state funding to decrease. Others, including Drake, continue to operate their programs without negative impacts.
Cameron University in Oklahoma offers an optional tuition guarantee program that has students paying a premium their first year to keep tuition set for the rest of their college career, with a traditional tuition payment plan still available. Berg said enrollment in the optional program is “very low.”
“An optional program such as this would need to be carefully designed and tested to avoid unintended consequences,” Berg said.
Regent Kurt Tjaden expressed concerns that a tuition guarantee would eventually lead to cutting costs in other areas, and the area with the most costs is in staffing.
“You’re taking that financial lever away, right, because you won’t be able to increase tuition for that class,” Tjaden said. “So said differently, to maintain financial viability the regents institutions are going to have to cut people — because that’s where the costs are — to offset that lost tuition.”
It would depend on the premium rate set by universities, Berg said, if that’s the plan the board decides to move forward with.
He said the study group discussed the optional tuition plan idea and recommended not having students other than undergraduate residents be eligible to participate. The premium that students taking the optional path would pay would also need to be scrutinized annually to change it if necessary.
All the board has to do with the report is receive it and submit it to the General Assembly, according to board documents, but board members still had the future on their minds.
Hensley suggested further study of interest in potential tuition guarantees in partnership with the Iowa College Access Network, an organization she said is in high schools across Iowa answering questions from students about college affordability and financial aid.
While the “primary benefit of a tuition guarantee program is to provide predictability for students and families,” Berg said a policy approved by the board in April makes tuition increases, or their limit, predictable as well.
The policy requires that base undergraduate tuition increases at state universities don’t go over the three-year inflation average set by the Higher Education Price Index. Berg said Iowa’s universities have hiked tuition by an average of 3.2% over the past five years.
Berg suggested, and Bates and other members of the board agreed, that waiting to see how the increase cap impacts institutions and students would be the best option before implementing any new strategies based on the tuition guarantee report.
“It would be beneficial for me to see the policies that we recently put in place work,” Berg said.

The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit against several former and current officials at the women’s prison in Lusk for their role in hiring and employing a guard who was later convicted of sexually assaulting an inmate in 2023.  The state contends that the lawsuit does not make […]
The post Wyoming Attorney Gene[...]","The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit against several former and current officials at the women’s prison in Lusk for their role in hiring and employing a guard who was later convicted of sexually assaulting an inmate in 2023. 
The state contends that the lawsuit does not make a plausible claim and was filed outside the statute of limitations. The motion to dismiss, filed Saturday, also argues that Wyoming’s U.S. District Court does not have jurisdiction in the case. 
“Consequently, the State Defendants should be dismissed from this action,” the motion states. 
Since 2020, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center have been convicted of sexually assaulting female inmates. One of those women, Chasity Jacobs, filed a federal lawsuit in August that argued the sexual abuse violated her constitutional rights. 
The lawsuit also makes a claim under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act for what the plaintiff described as negligence by the prison’s Warden Timothy Lang and Associate Warden Robert Harty. 
“The pervasive problem of sexual assault by WWC correctional officers was well known to prison administrators including, specifically, Defendants Lang and Hardy,” the lawsuit argues. “Despite this, Defendant Lang, and other supervisory personnel failed to implement safeguards or address the systemic breakdowns in hiring, training, reporting, or accountability that enabled repeated sexual abuse.” 
Before he was hired to work at the women’s prison in 2019, Joseph Gaul was fired from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit.

In 2023, he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault against the plaintiff. He was later sentenced to two to five years in prison and is eligible for parole in October, according to the Wyoming Department of Corrections. 
In a Sept. 30 response to the complaint, Gaul, 46, wrote that he had not yet secured an attorney for the case. The Wyoming Attorney General is representing Warden Lang and Associate Warden Harty.
Motion to dismiss
In its motion, the Wyoming Attorney General’s office claims that the U.S. Constitution’s 11th Amendment — which prohibits federal courts from hearing lawsuits against a state filed by citizens of another state or a foreign country — provides the state with immunity in this instance. 
More specifically, it bars federal court jurisdiction over a state agency, in this case the women’s prison, for both money damages and injunctive relief, the state argues. 
In the lawsuit, Jacobs makes claims under a federal statute known as Section 1983, which allows individuals to sue state and local government officials for depriving them of their constitutional or federal rights while acting “under color of state law.” 
The prison warden and deputy warden, however, “are not ‘persons’ subject” to Section 1983, the attorney general’s motion argues. 
Furthermore, the state alleges, the lawsuit does not establish that Lang or Harty acted in a deliberate, intentional way to violate the plaintiff’s legal rights. In other words, it is not enough that either Lang or Harty acted in a supervisory role when Gaul violated the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. 
“Jacobs manages to refer to a specific act… the hiring of Gaul… but she does not allege that the State Defendants actually did the hiring,” the motion states. 
“Jacobs also does not allege that the State Defendants knew anything about Gaul’s alleged history, and thus she does not begin to allege they had a culpable state of mind (deliberate indifference).” 
The state also accuses the plaintiff of filing a Wyoming Governmental Claims Act claim outside the two years allowed under the statute of limitations. 
“The latest sexual assault alleged by Jacobs in this case occurred on July 24, 2023,” the motion states. “Jacobs had until July 24, 2025 to file a notice of claim under the WGCA.”
And because Lang and Harty are state employees, “Jacobs was required to file the notice of claim with ‘the general services division of the department of administration and information,” the state’s motion claims.
When the lawsuit was filed in August, attorneys for Jacobs included an exhibit of a notice of claim to the Wyoming Department of Corrections, the Wyoming Attorney General, Lang and Harty. It is dated July 21, 2025.

State lawmakers have been trying to assess the value of providing state funding to online programs serving students outside North Dakota and neighboring states. 
“We are still highly subsidizing,” Sen. Ron Sorvaag, R-Fargo, chair of the Higher Education Funding Review Committee said of online classes. “We still need to understand, are we getting a bang for the buck?” 
A University System presentation said the state is spending about $22 million on online courses for out-of-state students for the most recent two-year budget cycle. That doesn’t include online students from Minnesota, Montana or South Dakota. 
Sen. Ronald Sorvaag, R-Fargo, speaks during a committee hearing on Nov. 12, 2025. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Sorvaag said legislators aren’t opposed to online education, but want to make sure the dollars that go to online courses through the state’s higher education funding formula are being used wisely. 
The committee will consider possible changes to the funding formula that could be made in the 2027 legislative session. 
Much of the discussion centered on out-of-state, online students. In 2021-23, the University System had nearly 9,000 out-of-state, online students who were not residents of neighboring states, according to figures presented to the committee. Total enrollment for those two years was more than 77,000 students.
Karla Mongeon-Stewart, vice president of finance for the University of North Dakota, addressed value by saying that UND students in that category contribute $2.09 in tuition and fees for every $1 of state funding. 
She said online students pay the same fees as on-campus students that help maintain buildings, pay down debt and keep fees for things such as recreation facilities low for on-campus students.
She said revenue from online students has helped keep UND financially stable at times when on-campus enrollment has waned. 
Mongeon-Stewart also highlighted how UND has built a reputation as a credible online institution that reflects positively on the whole state. She gave examples of Sara Sabry, an Egyptian astronaut, and Paige Jones, an Olympic-level skier from Utah, who chose to take classes from UND. 
She said UND also serves the military community and the two Air Force bases in the state. People living at a base may start their education in North Dakota but end up being deployed or transferred to another state. 
UND and Bismarck State College lead the North Dakota University System in online credit hours. 
UND’s most popular courses are nursing and engineering. Mongeon-Stewart said the additional enrollment from online students helps diversify the engineering course offerings the university can offer. 
Bismarck State’s most popular classes are related to the energy industry. 
Dan Leingang, interim president of Bismarck State College, said some of those students may not be seeking a degree but needing training to succeed with their current employer. 
His written testimony included letters of support from Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, and Jonathan Fortner, president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council. 
In other higher education meetings this fall, lawmakers have shown frustration with a lack of data on where out-of-state online students are living. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Mongeon-Stewart said there has not been consistency in how North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities track out-of-state online students, but the institutions are working on a uniform model. 
She said she hopes it will include information such as a North Dakota affiliation, like being a graduate from a high school or college in the state. 
“We are going to work really hard to do a better job in the future of giving you what you need,” she told lawmakers. 
Sorvaag said he was grateful for the presentations on out-of-state online students, but added that the Legislature must still decide if subsidizing those courses is the best use of state money. Lawmakers could decide state dollars are better spent in other areas, such as supporting scholarships for in-state students, he said. 
The question is part of a larger potential overhaul of the state’s funding formula for higher education. 
“The more we dig into this, the more we understand how complicated this is,” Sorvaag said.

(Juan Salinas II /Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is trying to repeat in a competition that saves more lives than sports.
A year after nearly 4,000 donors gave blood in UNL’s name, which nearly doubled the next closest competitor, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin narrowly leads Nebraska in the 2025 version of the blood feud. Nebraska is behind Wisconsin by about 100 donors.

UNL won $1 million in the inaugural competition last year for student or community health. The school is seeking a similar prize this year.
Nebraska volleyball player Andi Jackson, a junior middle blocker on the nation’s top-ranked team, urged Husker fans to step up again for a good cause. She said she had donated blood in the past and hopes the community will pitch in. 
“I didn’t realize the significance that your donation has and the impact that it can have,” Jackson said. 
 Jackson said giving blood “can save up to three lives [and] it can just give someone a little bit more time or save their life.” 
The past few years have seen a shortage of blood supply since the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Red Cross declared an emergency blood shortage in 2024. The university is planning three large campus blood drives this week. Two are at the Newman Center Wednesday and Thursday.  Another is happening at Memorial Stadium Friday.
The university is entering people who give blood Friday at Memorial Stadium into a raffle for tickets to the Nebraska-Iowa volleyball match. 
The school that wins the blood drive competition will be announced at the Big Ten Football Championship game Dec. 6 in Indianapolis.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state panel on Wednesday approved raises for future statewide elected officials totaling more than $500,000.
The Statewide Official Compensation Commission voted to increase the pay of statewide elected officials by at least 25%. Only the governor is slated to receive a smaller increase. The next governor will see a 5.4% pay increase, boosting that position’s pay from $147,000 to $155,000. Taxpayers provide the governor with a home and transportation.
The same board, which met for the first time since lawmakers created it, voted to more than double the state superintendent’s salary from $124,373 to $250,000.
Supporters of the hike argued that statewide officials’ salaries hadn’t been increased since 2009.
“The fact that they have not had a salary increase since 2009 – I’m embarrassed,” said David “Chip” Carter, a member of the commission.
The new salaries won’t go into effect until after the November 2026 election. State law prohibits elected officials from receiving a salary increase during their term in office.
Previously, lawmakers set the salary of statewide elected officials or tied them to judicial salaries, but they delegated the task to the newly created panel.
Carter said the new salaries should attract the best and brightest to the roles. He said some officials must give up earning potential to serve the state.
“I’m not embarrassed,” said Jeff Baumann, a member. “I didn’t set them. Those people all knew what they were doing when they took the job.”
Baumann also asked why the board canceled its original meeting set for Nov. 4.
Chairman Brian Jackson said the board didn’t want to vote on pay while recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program had their benefits put on hold due to the governmental shutdown, which began Oct. 1. Over 680,000 Oklahomans receive food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized the state to begin issuing partial payments earlier this week.
The lieutenant governor’s salary will rise to $145,000 from $114,713, a 26% increase.
A motion to raise it to $120,713 failed. The lieutenant governor is provided transportation.
The next attorney general will be paid $185,000, up from $132,825, a 39% increase.
Matt Tilly, a member and attorney, argued the increase is necessary because new attorneys at larger law firms make over $100,000 a year.
Other elected positions that saw salary increases include:

The three members of the Corporation Commission. They will each make $165,000, a nearly 44% increase from $114,713.
The state treasurer. The board increased that official’s pay by nearly 53%. It will increase to $175,000 from $114,713.
State auditor and inspector. That post will earn $150,000, up from $114,713, a nearly 31% hike.
Insurance commissioner. The commissioner will earn $185,000, up from $126,713, a 46% hike.
Labor commissioner. Pay for that role will rise to $135,000 from $105,053, a nearly 29% increase.

A motion to increase all the salaries by only 5% across the board failed to advance.

Trump is expected to sign it into law as early as Wednesday night. The enactment of the bill — and the subsequent renewal of federal payments — would resolve a dizzying weekslong saga over SNAP that placed the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who use the program in the middle of a political and legal battle playing out across every level of the federal judiciary. Since the shutdown began Oct. 1, the USDA has reversed its own position, the U.S. Supreme Court paused lower court orders and Trump himself expressed contradicting views.In the most recent chapter, USDA said it would authorize states to pay 65% of benefits for November, and the Supreme Court paused until Thursday night lower court orders compelling full payments. The department had previously told a Rhode Island federal court it could take weeks or even months for beneficiaries to receive the partial allotments and the administration continued to fight rulings to immediately release full funding, even as the shutdown crept toward its conclusion.",,,,2025-11-12 18:57:08.730459

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Millions of gallons of oily water and spilled petrochemicals from the Smitty’s Supply fire and explosion have been handled at three different sites, but state officials have granted an emergency request to bring some of the liquid and solid waste to a Jefferson Parish landfill.  
River Birch LLC, which operates a landfill in Avondale, received a permit exemption last month from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to accept waste recovered after the Aug. 22 fire disaster in Tangipahoa Parish, according to LDEQ records the agency published this week.
Although River Birch’s Class 1 injection wells are permitted for only non-hazardous materials, a 1996 federal law allows them to be used to dispose of certain hazardous materials mixed when with water. River Birch uses its injection wells for petrochemical wastewater, industrial sludge, oily waters, solvents, acids, contaminated groundwater and stormwater, and other liquid wastes that would otherwise be considered hazardous, according to the company’s website.
River Birch’s injection well permit allows it to accept liquid waste statewide, but its solid waste permit is limited to a 13-parish area that doesn’t include Tangipahoa. The company requested the emergency solid waste exception on Oct. 13, and the state approved it two days later. 
“This is a unique opportunity for Smitty’s to manage all of its contaminated waste at a properly permitted facility,” Chris Casteix, River Birch’s environmental compliance manager, wrote in the company’s emergency request to the agency.

In its approval letter to River Birch, the Department of Environmental Quality said the waste from Smitty’s Supply “will have no significant adverse impact on the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.”
It’s unclear how much waste Smitty’s Supply will send to the River Birch landfill. Neither company has responded to calls or emails. 
More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28. Roughly half of that amount has already been disposed of at other facilities, according to information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state. 
As of Oct. 16, EPA contractors brought 2.7 million gallons of recovered waste to Preston Environmental Solutions in Baton Rouge for recycling and 3.7 million gallons to Woodside Landfill in Livingston Parish for solidification. 
Another 595,000 gallons has been taken to a landfill in Liberty, Mississippi, and injected underground, according to LDEQ records.
Underground injection of liquid waste is an accepted disposal practice under state and federal laws. 
Whether it’s an injection well for waste disposal or an oil well for extraction, the structure is mostly the same. A hole is drilled to a desired depth, typically around 4,000 feet for Class 1 wells, and supported with long sections of pipe cemented in place to prevent cave-ins. Often an additional layer of tubing lines the inner walls of the pipe to prevent leaks. There is no encasement or container at the bottom of the well. The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground. 
As of Sept. 30, 2025, petrochemicals still filled ponds near the Tangipahoa River across the street from the destroyed Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland nearly six weeks after itcaught fire and exploded. (Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
The EPA requires a Class 1 well to extend below the lowermost formations containing drinking water within a quarter-mile vicinity. Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, said there must be a good enough barrier of impervious rock to prevent any of the waste from seeping upwards. 
 River Birch’s website says its wells are positioned 6,500 feet underground.   
Injection wells are generally the cheapest option to dispose of contaminated liquid waste, but they do carry some risks such as well leaks and groundwater contamination, according to the EPA and other sources. The federal agency says underground injection is safe when the wells are placed at an appropriate site and properly maintained.
As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday. 
“River Birch will be disposing of non-hazardous solid waste that they are already permitted to dispose of,” LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said.

Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply. She wants to know who determines whether the waste going to River Birch is hazardous or not and if any kind of testing is required to make that determination. 
“Even if it’s technically OK, should the parish take in waste from Smitty’s?” Karlin said. “Everything I’ve seen suggests that the Smitty’s waste is likely highly toxic.”
Members of the Jefferson Parish Council have not responded to her questions about River Birch’s permit, she said. 
Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng and Councilmembers at-large Jennifer Van Vrancken and Scott Walker have not responded to a reporter’s request for comment.
Karlin also questioned whether River Birch’s permit exemption warranted expedited approval when waste from Tangipahoa Parish was already going to other landfills that were closer in distance.

(Screenshot from livestream)As the Capitol building buzzed with news of a long-awaited budget deal on Wednesday, two dozen House lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee debated the wording of bills on post-conviction relief for certain veterans and restitution for juvenile offenders.
Several measures on the lengthy agenda passed unanimously, but some Republicans had concerns that imprecise language could have unintended consequences. 
“Many of these are just not ready for prime time today,” summarized Franklin’s Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin), the minority committee chair. 
House Bill 458, sponsored by Rep. Carol Hill-Evans (D-York), sought to expand an existing allowance made for veterans in the criminal justice systems with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. 
State law allows veterans to submit either diagnosis as a mitigating factor during sentencing, but not as part of a post-conviction review — leaving out those who are diagnosed while incarcerated. 
 
Veteran defendants made up 5.6% of all criminal dockets in Pennsylvania between 2016 and 2021 — with rural counties having disproportionately higher numbers of veteran defendants.


“These are men and women who served our country honorably, and it’s not uncommon for their trauma to go unrecognized or untreated for months or even years,” said Hill-Evans. 
“Those invisible wounds of war may have contributed to the circumstances that led to their incarceration. Justice demands that we take that into account,” she added.
A December memo accompanying the bill notes that any veteran diagnosed prior to 1980, when PTSD was first recognized as a mental illness, couldn’t use their diagnosis as a factor during their sentencing. 
“This bill does not guarantee anyone a reduced sentence; it simply gives the courts the opportunity to review the full picture,” said Hill-Evans. 
But Republicans questioned whether its wording might cover other mental health disorders.

“I am concerned that the broad nature of this bill technically allows for the defense of just mental distress or disability,” said Rep. Timothy Bonner (R-Mercer). “I would support the bill if it were limited.” 
Three of the 12 GOP committee members joined the 14 Democrats in support of the proposal. It passed on a 17-9 vote.
The panel unanimously approved House Bill 866, sponsored by Rep. Joe Webster (D-Montgomery), that would require the state Department of Corrections to provide briefings to veterans about whether their veteran benefits might be restored upon release.
 Restitution and the juvenile justice system

A bill seeking to eliminate most fines and fees for juvenile offenders also encountered pushback.
House Bill 1385 sponsor Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny)  said such costs kept low-income young people in the justice system longer than their wealthier peers. She said the proposal came at the recommendation of the state’s 2021 Juvenile Justice Task Force.

“These are intended for adult offenders and not really contemplating the ability of a juvenile to be able to pay them,” said Kinkead. “In many instances, these kids aren’t actually even able to get jobs.”
Originally, the measure addressed several topics, but a committee amendment stripped that all away — leaving only the portion addressing fees and fines. 
Kauffman questioned the use of the phrase “actual victim” in the bill, an undefined term. Kinkead said she believed that phrase was “a reflection of the bill’s intent to only have restitution imposed in cases where an individual suffers actual material loss.” 
“The idea that (actual victim) was included in the bill makes my skin crawl,” said Kauffman. “A victim is a victim.”
Kauffman also shared a concern that eliminating such costs “prioritizes the offender over the victim” and shifts the focus away from compensating crime victims. 
“Once again, I think this one is not ready for prime time, but needs some additional work,” he noted.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah state senator on Wednesday officially became the first Democrat to throw her name into the race for the states’ new 1st Congressional District next year under a newly drawn map that was court ordered earlier this week. 
Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, is known to be a fighter on Utah’s Capitol Hill — often a fiery voice on the Senate floor advocating for progressive stances on issues ranging from education to health care. 
Now, she hopes to bring that same fighting voice to Congress in the 2026 midterm elections — a year when she and other Democrats have high hopes of recapturing the majority in the U.S. House. 
Democrats ‘fired up’ for Utah in 2026
Depending on how Democrats fare across the country, the 2026 midterms could shine a unique spotlight on Utah, which for the first time in more than 20 years is on track to have a Democratic-leaning congressional district. The state that has long been reliably red now has the potential of tipping the political scales in the U.S. House for Democrats. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, in a statement earlier this week lauding Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map said “every seat counts, and Democrats everywhere are fired up and ready to take back the House” in 2026. 
“It’s going to totally change the face of Utah at the national level,” Riebe told Utah News Dispatch in an interview, adding that the Beehive State has long been “taken for granted” as a guaranteed Republican stronghold. 
“It’s going to be a big change,” she said. “You know, we have people concerned that we’re a flyover state. And now we won’t be.”
Riebe said she was planning on running for Congress next year regardless of what map 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson picked in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, but now she’s gearing up to run for District 1 — a district concentrated around northern Salt Lake County. 
Because that district leans heavily Democratic, it’s likely the race will be determined by the Democratic primary. And Riebe isn’t the only one eying the seat. Utah’s last Democratic congressman, former Rep. Ben McAdams, is expected to formally announce his candidacy Thursday. 
Utah Democrats want a ‘strong Democrat,’ Riebe says
Riebe said she’s “not concerned at all” about facing off with McAdams, saying she’s confident that she’s a “strong candidate.”
“I’ve done a lot of hard work for the people of Utah and Salt Lake County,” she said. “(McAdams) has his voting records, and people can start to look at that. I know that something that’s really been brought up to me, frequently, is his support of independents. And Democrats want a Democrat. And they want a strong Democrat. So I feel like that’s going to be the difference between him and I.” 
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

McAdams has been known to have more of a moderate and collaborative style. In 2022, he was a leading voice urging his party to forfeit a Democratic nominee and instead back independent candidate Evan McMullin in an effort to unseat Republican Sen. Mike Lee. The party voted to do so — but in the end the effort failed, and McMullin lost. 
Riebe expects the Democratic race for District 1 will be hard fought. “I always anticipate it being a hard race, and I fully anticipate doing everything I can to make sure that I present myself well.”
When McAdams won his congressional election in 2018, it was by narrow margins against the GOP — but now that the newly-drawn District 1 is likely to be reliably Democratic-leaning, Riebe said that changes the dynamics of next year’s race. 
“I think it’s going to give me a lot of strength to stand up for the values of Salt Lake County,” she said. “We’re not like the rest of the state. We have a very urban feel to it. We rely on taking care of a very diverse community. So when you’re running a state race that’s more competitive and you have a bigger field, you have to be a little bit more scattered in your decisions.”
“But for me,” she added, “I’m here to fight for what my county wants now. And I don’t think we’ve had that in a while.” 
Priorities
In her official campaign announcement Wednesday morning, Riebe signaled that affordable health care will be a top priority for her — at a time when Democrats in Congress have tried (so far unsuccessfully) to pressure Republicans to counter skyrocketing health insurance premiums for people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
“Republicans promised to bring prices down, but instead costs have gone up with Trump’s reckless tariffs, and Republicans have slashed health care — all to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Riebe said in a news release. “That’s why I was so frustrated to see Democrats in Washington take a deal that didn’t do anything to extend the much-needed Affordable Care Act tax subsidies that working families need to help them get by.”
Riebe said it’s “become evident that in order to change what we get out of Washington, we have to change the kind of representatives we send there.” 
“In Congress, I’ll never back down from the fight to lower costs and increase health care affordability,” Riebe said, adding that she also “won’t take a dime” of corporate political action committee money “so I’m only accountable to the people who sent me.”

“I know how to get things accomplished in a divided government, and I’m ready to make Washington work for working families in Utah,” she said. 
Riebe said she’ll do the same as she has on Utah’s Capitol Hill: speak up for the state’s liberal voices who haven’t felt represented by Republicans in power. While she acknowledged in the Utah Senate she doesn’t “get my name on a lot of bills,” she said she makes sure to be the fighting voice to ensure those who disagree with the supermajority GOP get heard. 
“Sometimes you have to be the fighter and the lone vote ‘no’ just to say … there has to be a line in the sand,” she said. “So I’ll fight when I need to and I’ll collaborate when I can.” 
Who is Kathleen Riebe? 
Riebe was first elected to the Utah Senate in 2019. Before her legislative service, she served on the Utah State Board of Education. 
Riebe has a long career in education — having been an educator in Granite School District and more recently a digital teaching and learning coach. She helps train teachers, including in rural areas.
But before her career in education, Riebe said she’s also worked in a lot of other working-class jobs. Aside from being a teacher, she said she’s also worked as a truck driver, waitress, police dispatcher, barista and forestry technician. 
“I’ve had to work really hard … I’m one of the few people that show up to a job every day and get paid to work,” she said. “A lot of people have a lot more financial security than I do — and I think that’s what’s really missing in our government right now. We don’t recognize how hard people are really trying to make ends meet.”

In her current role as an educator, Riebe said she sees people in rural communities who are “really struggling.” 
“I’m in schools. I see families. I understand that they don’t eat sometimes. I see how many free lunches we’re serving. I see kids come to school with medical issues that aren’t being addressed,” Riebe said, adding that it’s “really shocking to me” that those in Washington, D.C. “don’t have a heart for the people that are struggling.” 
Riebe said if she’s elected to represent Utah in Congress, she’ll prioritize fighting for affordable health care while also defending against what she characterized as attacks on the education system, both in Utah and across the nation. 
“I’m also concerned about immigration and how our average citizens are afraid to walk the streets if they are, you know, someone who speaks Spanish,” she said. “You know, calling out the National Guard to fight against the average citizen is just not what I believe America should be.” 
Riebe said she believes she’s the right person to fight for Utah at a time when she “totally” believes Democrats will take back the U.S. House in 2026 to push back against President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“I think people are very, very alarmed at what’s coming out of Washington right now,” she said. “From knocking down the East Wing, to these aggressive executive orders, to taking away congressional benefits that we really have no rights to do… It’s alarming. And it’s really hurting the people that work hard to keep America going.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns hoping for clarity on the government’s next move to keep the Colorado River from drying up and still supply plenty of water to the state will have to wait. 
Utah and six other states along the parched river haven’t reached a deal on how they’ll share the water supply a year from now, but they agree enough to keep talking. That progress means they don’t have to turn the job over to the federal government yet, Utah’s negotiator said Wednesday. 
A century-old compact governs use of the river based on flows that have dwindled during decades of overuse, drought and climate change. The river provides 27% of Utah’s water.

“The question is, how do you divide a pie that’s significantly smaller than it has been, when everybody is used to getting that big piece of the pie?” said Gene Shawcroft, Utah’s Colorado River commissioner. 
The federal government set a Nov. 11 deadline for a broad agreement, but gave the states approval to keep talking as they work toward a February cutoff to reach a firm deal, Shawcroft told reporters in a brief conference call. 
He reiterated the states are on the same page about ensuring the river’s “long-term sustainability and resilience.” He did not share specifics on any consensus they’ve reached for how they’ll get there. 
“We have agreed on a number of things that allow us to continue to work together,” Shawcroft said. “The details, we’re still working out.”
In months of negotiations, the upstream states — Utah, Colorado and Wyoming — have stood their ground against a new system that would include mandatory cuts in dry years. Shawcroft indicated they still aren’t budging. 
“In the Upper Basin, mandatory reductions are something that we don’t feel is necessary,” he said.
The Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California typically use almost all of their allocated water, while the Upper Basin does not. The downstream states have said if cuts aren’t shared across all seven in the new plan, the reductions they face may be too big to absorb. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Shawcroft’s view, negotiators did not miss a deadline because they have enough accord to satisfy the federal government. But seven conservation and recreation groups say they wanted more from Tuesday’s milestone and they’re “deeply disappointed.” 
“Without a clear operating framework, the basin remains exposed to escalating risks — from declining storage in lakes Powell and Mead to deepening uncertainty about how the system will respond to hydrologic extremes,” The Nature Conservancy, National Audubon Society and others said in a joint statement. “Every month without alignment makes it harder to stabilize the river and protect the people, economies, and ecosystems that depend on it.”

The groups called on the US. Department of the Interior and its Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees water in the West and is working with the states, to “lead with urgency and resolve.” 
Negotiators are meeting every week, Shawcroft said. They’re still working out how reservoirs including Flaming Gorge on the Utah-Wyoming border will be managed. 
Over the summer, they considered a new way of dividing the river based on how much water would flow in the basins if humans never dammed it or funneled it away for cities, farms and other uses. But the “natural flow” plan hit a wall. 
“We couldn’t come to agreement,” Shawcroft said. “Concepts, however, of the natural flow, will likely be included in where we go from here.” 
He noted the Central Utah project, which pipes Colorado River water to cities and farms on the Wasatch Front, is a junior user, meaning it’s among the first in line to absorb cuts in a shortage. 
Shawcroft said the state has to be judicious when the water runs low and compensating farmers to conserve water can help.

State reaches $500,000 settlement with retailer after inspectors discovered hundreds of price discrepancies at stores across the state.

Walgreens has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle claims of overcharging at its stores in Vermont — including in one instance where an item rang at the register $23 higher than its shelf price, the state Attorney General’s Office said Wednesday.
“Deceptive advertising harms consumers and the marketplace, and it will not be tolerated,”
Attorney General Charity Clark said in a statement announcing the agreement.
Walgreens, which operates nearly 8,000 stores in the U.S., did not “contest the facts” in the settlement and cooperated with the investigation, according to the agreement. The company did not return calls for comment. 
The pricing discrepancies were discovered in a routine inspection by the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets’ weights and measures program, according to the agreement, released Wednesday. The inspections involved visits to the stores to make sure that shelf prices of items matched the prices at the registers, according to the attorney general’s statement.
Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the attorney general, said the “pattern of pricing inaccuracies” uncovered during the routine checks at the stores in Vermont prompted the opening of a larger investigation to determine what was going on.  
Between 2018 and 2024, the statement added, the state inspectors found 416 overcharge errors, with the overcharges ranging from 4 cents to $23 per item, with a median overage of $1.92.
The inspectors randomly selected products at the stores, from personal care and health items to groceries, according to Vath.
The Walgreens stores included locations in Barre, Brattleboro, Bristol, Burlington, Colchester, Enosburg Falls, Essex Junction, Fair Haven, Hardwick, Manchester Center, Middlebury, Milton, Montpelier, Morrisville, Newport, Rutland, Shelburne, South Burlington, St. Albans, West Rutland, Williston, Wilmington and Winooski.
Vath said the parties reached a settlement before a lawsuit was filed.
Investigations leading to settlements with retailers related to overcharging claims are not “terribly uncommon” in Vermont, according to Vath. In one of Vermont’s largest such cases involving price discrepancies, the state settled with Dollar General in 2017 for $1.7 million. 
Under the terms of the Walgreens settlement, in addition to the $500,000 payment, the retailer is required to submit third-party pricing audits from stores to the Attorney General’s Office for the next three years and correct any inaccuracies.
Walgreens “has explained that the acquisition of Vermont Rite Aid stores and the challenges in store operations and staffing associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were the primary catalysts for Walgreens’ heightened failure rate in the year 2022,” the document stated. 
“Walgreens’ overcharge rates improved significantly in 2023 and 2024, decreasing each year,” the document added. 
Of the $500,000 that Walgreens has agreed to pay the state, the settlement calls for $25,000 to go to the Community Health Center of Burlington, which works to provide affordable health services to Vermonters.
The remainder of the settlement money will go to the state’s general fund.

Mikie Sherrill (D) said Wednesday she will resign from the House of Representatives next week before becoming New Jersey's new governor in January. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Mikie Sherrill used her final speech to Congress Wednesday evening to blast a bipartisan bill to end the government shutdown and urge her fellow Democrats in the House to stop its GOP members from becoming “a ceremonial red stamp” for the Trump administration.
Sherrill said she will resign her House seat next week to transition to her next job as New Jersey’s governor. Her resignation will allow Gov. Phil Murphy to initiate the special election to fill her vacancy in the 11th district, which covers parts of Morris, Essex, and Passaic counties. Sherrill will be sworn in as New Jersey’s 57th governor in January.
Speaking briefly during fiery debate on the funding bill, Sherrill said she would not vote for it because it “does nothing to protect over 450,000 New Jerseyans who will see their health care premiums skyrocket.”
The funding bill does not include a provision Democrats like Sherrill pushed for that would extend federal subsidies for health care plans bought on the individual marketplace. Costs for those plans are expected to rise dramatically in the new year when the subsidies expire.
Sherrill pointed to her Navy background and told her House colleagues she swore an oath “to run toward the fight,” adding that she would “stop at nothing to lower costs and build opportunity for everyone.”
“To my colleagues, do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp from an administration that takes food away from children and rips away health care,” Sherrill said. “To the country, stand strong. As we say in the Navy: Don’t give up the ship.”
A number of candidates have already lined up for the chance to replace Sherrill in the House, including former Rep. Tom Malinowski and Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill.
Sherrill joined Congress in 2019 and was reelected three times. Her current term expires in January 2027.

Free.,"Arizona’s Adelita Grijalva sworn in to US House, signs Epstein petition",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arizonas-adelita-grijalva-sworn-us-house-signs-epstein-petition,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to office Wednesday after a delay that U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson attributed to the long government shutdown, but that critics allege was because the Arizona lawmaker pledged to be the deciding signature on a petition to release the so-called Epstein files.Grijalva, who was elected on Sept. 23, has publicly vowed to add her name to a bipartisan measure that would force the House to vote on the release of files from the government’s investigation of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.The Trump administration said in July it would not release further information related to the case. President Donald Trump had campaigned on releasing the files.Grijalva, Arizona’s first elected Latina, called the delayed ceremony an “abuse of power.”“It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona's 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them. … One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing-in of a duly elected member of Congress for political reasons,” said Grijalva, who filled the seat occupied by her late father, Raúl Grijalva, who died earlier this year.“Our democracy only works when everyone has a voice. This includes the millions of people across the country who have experienced violence and exploitation, including Liz Stein and Jessica Michaels, both survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse,” Grijalva said. “They are here in the gallery with us this evening.”To cheers from her Democratic colleagues in the chamber, Grijalva said she was going to sign the petition “right now.”  Massie, Khanna lead petition driveAs of early September, the discharge petition, led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., had garnered the signatures of all Democrats and four Republicans, leaving the petition just one shy of the 218 signatures needed to bypass Johnson and force a vote on the House floor.The three Republicans who joined Massie in signing were Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.The petition forces to the floor, likely at some point in the next few weeks, a Massie-sponsored resolution from July compelling the Department of Justice to “disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein” and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted on federal sex trafficking charges.  The resolution attracted 50 cosponsors, nearly a dozen of them Republicans.Johnson defends delayGrijalva and her supporters have outright accused Johnson of delaying the swearing-in because of the Epstein petition.“When the American people vote, this chamber respects their will and seats them immediately. Politics should never come into play,” said Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., on the House floor moments before Johnson administered the oath to Grijalva.Democrats pointed to the fact that Johnson has previously sworn in other lawmakers when the House was not in session. Johnson argued in mid-October that Grijalva hadn’t yet been sworn in because she won her special election after the House went home on Sept. 19, followed shortly thereafter by a government shutdown on Oct. 1.  “As soon as (Sen.) Chuck Schumer opens the government … we'll have that as soon as we get back to business,” he said. At a press conference on Oct. 15, Arizona Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego accused Johnson of protecting “pedophiles, whether it's involving Donald Trump or any of his rich, elite friends.”Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein. Trump maintains he booted Epstein from his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because the financier had poached young female employees.A deluge of Epstein documentsNew emails revealing details about the relationship between Trump and Epstein surfaced Wednesday. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released three exchanges with content suggesting Trump was aware of Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. Republican leaders on the committee soon followed by releasing more than 20,000 documents they received from the Epstein estate.Reports also surfaced that the Trump administration had reached out to two GOP lawmakers, Boebert and Mace, about removing their names from the petition.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to confirm during Wednesday’s briefing that Trump had met with Boebert in the Situation Room, a secure center of national and global information for the president.“I'm not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room,” Leavitt said when asked about Trump approaching Boebert to remove her name.Boebert’s office pointed States Newsroom to the lawmaker’s afternoon social media post that read,“I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”Mace’s office did not respond to questions to confirm the White House reached out to the South Carolina lawmaker. Rather, Mace’s Communications Director Sydney Long said, “​​The Congresswoman is not removing her name from the discharge petition because of her personal story.”Mace has publicly shared her own story of sexual assault.",,,,2025-11-12 18:57:08.730459

While doing research about the Civil War, Champlain Valley Union High School social studies teacher Tyler Alexander found an image of an 1872 painting by Julian Scott titled “The 4th Vermont Forming Under Fire,” which he hoped to include in a new book.
The problem was, at least initially, it appeared that no one in Vermont knew the painting even existed.
Internet searches were no help, and it was a few months before Alexander got his first good lead. Years ago, a Texas insurance company asked Vermont art historian Robert Titteron, who had written a book about Julian Scott, to appraise the value of the painting Alexander was seeking, and he still had the written communications. The last known owner was the University of Houston — and not only did the university still have the painting, it was about to auction it off.
Alexander quickly contacted David Schutz, the Vermont State Curator, who immediately contacted Vermont historians Howard Coffin and Kevin Graffagnino. With less than a week before the auction, there was no way to secure state money, so Coffin and Graffagnino asked Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton, who owns the largest private collection of Vermont art, for help.
Orton won the bidding for the painting and agreed to lend it to the state for display in the Statehouse’s Cedar Creek Room, which already had four other Civil War paintings by Scott, including “The First Vermont Brigade at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Oct. 19th 1864,” a 10-by-20-foot mural commissioned by the legislature and unveiled in 1874.
Skip forward 151 years, to Oct. 29, 2025, and an unveiling that brought Alexander, Orton, Coffin, Schutz, Graffagnino, a uniformed contingent from Vermont’s Civil War Hemlocks, and scores of other Vermonters to the Cedar Creek Room.
Alexander read a vivid description of the battle from one of the letters in his book, Coffin described the battle portrayed in the painting, Orton talked about his affinity for Vermont art, and Schutz reminded everyone that the Statehouse opened only two years before the Civil War started, and was, in a sense, baptized by that event.
A native of Johnson, Vermont, 15-year-old Scott joined the war as a drummer and fifer. He made camp and battle sketches during the war, and after it, he became a trained artist. Not only is his newly discovered painting on display at the Statehouse — it is also on the cover of Alexander’s new book, “If I Can Get Home This Fall: A Story of Love, Loss, and a Cause in the Civil War” (University of Nebraska Press 2025).

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE, Kan. — Government, university and community leaders commemorated the opening Wednesday of a state-of-the-art convention center at the University of Kansas, which is equipped with amenities meant to draw thousands of annual visitors and generate revenue to pay off the university’s large-scale development project.
More than 100 people milled about the center’s grand entrance hall and conference rooms to hear Gov. Laura Kelly, university chancellor Douglas Girod and three others praise the teamwork and vision behind the University of Kansas Conference Center. They predicted a future of economic and community prosperity before cutting a ceremonious red ribbon held by the university’s mascots, Big Jay and Baby Jay.
The center is part of the project to revamp the school’s football stadium and northern campus entrance to create the Gateway District. The project could cost up to $808 million, and it relies heavily on state and local incentives, along with funding from the Republican-led Kansas Legislature and private donors to subsidize development.
The conference center is expected to be among the first steps in producing a return on those public and private investments.

“Not only will this facility benefit the greater Lawrence community, but it will also attract out-of-state visitors, spurring significant economic activity,” said Kelly, a Democrat. “Today marks a major step towards completion of the first phase of the university’s Gateway District project.”
The 55,000-square-foot center is the first of its kind in Douglas County. Kelly said the conference center has “required an intense collaborative effort.”
It is adjoined to the David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium, and the center’s visitors can access a patio that puts them at eye-level with players and coaches. Conference center users can also access stadium amenities, including the digital scoreboard, meeting rooms and various offices, said Girod.

The university envisions galas, weddings, conventions, trade shows and other large social events as potential uses for the center, said Girod. Event bookings already stretch into 2027, he said.
“As a result of this design, it really positions us to host all kinds of events, bringing out-of-town visitors into our community,” Girod said, “and that’s really what it’s all about at the end of the day, to generate additional economic activity to the city, county, state and beyond.”
Girod said he hopes the new center will attract events from around the world. An estimated 400,000 people visit Lawrence annually. KU’s Rock Chalk Park soccer complex on the western edge of the city is currently under consideration for hosting a team base camp for the 2026 World Cup.
The conference center isn’t a typical one, in large part because of its location, Girod said.
“Right in the heart of Lawrence, right at the foot of the hill, right at the base of campus, right at the gateway of our campus, and, of course, as part of our stadium,” he said.

The Legislature allocated $35 million to the project in 2022 from American Rescue Plan Act funds. It received $50 million in grant funding in 2023 from the Kansas Department of Commerce, which required a three-to-one match of private funds. The city of Lawrence approved in August a $95 million package of incentives, including the city’s first Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR, bonds, which allow the city to finance the project with nearly $86 million in bonds. Once built, the development’s revenues and sales taxes will pay off the bonds.
Now that phase 1 is complete, the roughly $300 million phase 2 is expected to begin once KU’s football season ends, said Girod.
The second phase is expected to begin with renovations to the east side of the football stadium and construction of a parking garage and a 150-room hotel. A roughly 440-bed student housing complex, outdoor event plaza and retail, restaurant and office space are expected to follow, extending use of the area beyond football season.

Nearly 1 million people are predicted to visit the Gateway District annually once the project is complete in 2030, according to a feasibility study submitted to the city of Lawrence. Developers expect the district to produce a net economic output of $84.9 million and more than 1,600 full-time jobs.
“Today marks a shift in what is possible in Lawrence,” said Kim Anspach, the executive director of Explore Lawrence, the city’s tourism arm.
Capacity often restricted the city’s ability to host and grow events, she said. The center helps create a “steady rhythm of activity,” which helps support the year-round stability of the local economy.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Advocates for food aid called Wednesday for the state to participate next year in a federal program aimed at making sure children don’t go hungry during the summer when school meals are not available.
Advocates with the Save the Children Network and Iowa Hunger Coalition called for the state to participate in the federal SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, in 2026. Participants access benefits through a Electronic Benefits Transfer card that can be used to buy food at retail stores.
The state this year launched an alternative pilot program called Healthy Kids Iowa, which is now ending.
The organizations gave a petition with more than 600 signatures to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ office Wednesday, saying the state is leaving $29.4 million in federal funding on the table by not participating in the federal summer nutrition program. The SUN Bucks program, which became a permanent program in 2024, provides eligible low-income families with $40 per child each month when school is not in session — $120 total — through an EBT card.
The state chose not to participate in the program in 2024 and 2025, with Reynolds saying she had opposed the program as it does not ensure families are buying nutritious food using the funds. Hunger advocates have criticized the governor’s decision, saying the choice is leaving funding on the table that is available for Iowa families in need.
While Iowa has not participated in Summer EBT, federal funding was awarded this year for a separate summer nutrition program: the Healthy Kids Iowa pilot program. This alternate summer feeding project, approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May, provided eligible families with a premade box of food each month worth $40, available for pick-up at 266 access points — largely local food pantries — across the state. The governor said in August the program is a more efficient way to address summer food insecurity, as some Iowa food banks “said that they can actually buy up to six times more food than a person using that SUN Bucks program at retail prices.”
Though hunger advocates and food bank officials said they were supportive of the additional funding available for addressing food needs through Healthy Kids Iowa, some said the program presented its own issues. Families faced transportation barriers in getting to the food banks to pick up boxes, advocates said, and pantries struggled to meet the increased demand and work required to implement the program.
Paige Chickering, the Iowa state manager for SCAN, was one of the organizers dropping off the petition. Chickering said while the Healthy Kids Iowa program did help address some food needs over the summer this year, she said participating in Summer EBT would help more Iowa families in need.
“Healthy Kids Iowa was only able to serve less than a third of those who would have qualified for Summer EBT — which does make sense, it was about a third of the funding, and so the goal of the program was to serve about a third of those children,” Chickering said. “But put that in perspective, Summer  EBT would serve 245,000 eligible children statewide, and Healthy Kids Iowa, the goal was to serve about 65,000 kids.”
The USDA granted a waiver for $9.1 million for Healthy Kids Iowa that would have otherwise gone toward Summer EBT program funding. This amount is a significant shortfall from the $29.4 million available to serve 244,000 children statewide through Summer EBT, Chickering said — though participation would require Iowa fund half of the administrative costs for the program, roughly $2.2 million.
While the USDA approved Healthy Kids Iowa funding in 2025, federal funding may not be available in 2026, Chickering said. Healthy Kids Iowa received federal dollars because was a pilot program, she said, but typically, “there’s an expectation that if a program like that is to continue, it would need to be state-funded.”
“I believe … that’s what would have to happen with Healthy Kids Iowa,” Chickering said. “And now we’re back to this disparity with Summer EBT, right, if Iowa were to put state dollars into a program, they can only do so much with those state dollars. Even if they were to match that $9 million that happened for Healthy Kids Iowa this year, we can only serve so much need that way — whereas, the state could just put in $2.2 million to receive that $29.4 million in federal funds through Summer EBT. And if we think about return on investment and how to stretch our funding and budget further, that really seems like a no-brainer.”
Chickering, alongside Luke Elzinga, board chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition, said there have been discussions on implementing similar restrictions on Summer EBT that are in place for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Iowa that would limit the purchase of unhealthy foods and beverages. Elzinga said in June the coalition was not able to persuade the governor to pursue SUN Bucks implementation with these restrictions in place.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the petition or future plans for summer nutrition programs in 2026.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Ryan Friedrichs, vice president of Related Companies and husband of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, is a vice president in the company that is now pushing the development of a 1-gigawatt Oracle and OpenAI data center in a rural Washtenaw County township.
The connection between Friedrichs and the data center was first reported by conservative news outlet The Midwesterner. The Detroit News also previously reported that Friedrichs was a registered lobbyist in Michigan for the company, although Benson’s campaign provided proof that his lobbying license was terminated for the state in May.
Still, his role as the vice president of Development with Related Companies, which is the parent company of Related Digital, which is developing the project, has opened up questions about potential conflicts of interest if Benson should win the Democratic gubernatorial primary and go on to win the race for governor next fall.
Related Companies is based in New York and owned by Stephen Ross, a billionaire who also owns the National Football League’s Miami Dolphins. Ross has had close ties to Benson’s over the years, as she was the CEO of the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality. He has also donated to her campaign for governor to the tune of $8,325, according to Benson’s July campaign filing with the state.

The multi-billion dollar data center project would be the largest such data center in Michigan history, a facility expected to create 2,500 union construction jobs and 450 permanent jobs on site, with 1,500 more planned throughout the community to support the center.
Construction on the project is expected to begin in early 2026, with Related Digital and Oracle Cloud developing the facility as part of Oracle’s partnership with Open AI. DTE Energy confirmed it will supply 1.4 gigawatts of load for the facility, marking its first contract with a data center.

But the project is only moving forward after a legal settlement was brokered between the developer and the host community, which has opposed the project. A Washtenaw County judge approved a settlement between Related Digital and Saline Township, with the developer and the owner of the 575 acres of farmland slated for the project filing suit after the Township Board voted 4-1 against rezoning the land for the project.
Environmental activists have also warned that data centers can deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, in addition to pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals. They also have raised concerns for utility  ratepayers who might be affected by the project.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has since filed a notice with state energy regulators intervening in DTE Energy’s request to approve two contracts allowing them to supply power to the data center.
As The Midwesterner noted, Friedrichs cheered on the data center project on social media, including his LinkedIn page.
Michigan Advance reached out to Benson’s campaign for comment and to answer three questions.
The Advance asked the campaign if Friedrichs would step down from his role at Related Companies if Benson becomes governor and the data center project moves forward, considering he would be involved in a company that has a clear state business interest.
The campaign was asked if Benson supported AI data centers and more specifically the Saline Township project, considering the ecological damage environmental advocates say they can cause and other community concerns.

On the perception issue, Benson’s campaign was asked if they were worried about the optics of the candidate’s husband being so closely tied to a controversial project.
The campaign, in an emailed response, did not directly answer those questions and sent over two statements from campaign manager Nikki Goldschein and Benson supporter state Rep. Carrie Rheingans.
Goldschein did at least address the question of whether Benson supported the project being led by the company that her husband works for.
“Transparency and job growth will always be at the forefront of Jocelyn Benson’s administration and she’s made that clear from Day 1 of this campaign,” Goldschein said. “This new data center will create thousands of jobs in SE Michigan, but Jocelyn knows that neither this nor any other data center can be built at the expense of Michiganders’ already high electricity bills or access to clean water. We look forward to seeing these concerns addressed as public engagement on this project moves forward.”
Rheingans touted Benson’s commitment to transparency.
“Jocelyn Benson has successfully led our state’s second-largest agency for the past seven years, demonstrating unwavering commitment to transparency, integrity, and efficiency on behalf of the people of Michigan,” Rheingans said. “To suggest that her ability to lead as governor would be compromised because of her husband’s professional work is not only unfounded but frankly sexist. Her record speaks for itself: Jocelyn Benson has proven time and again that she is more than capable of leading effectively, independently, and in the best interest of all Michiganders.”

It shut down last month because of financial problems.
It was the second charter school in two years to close during its first year, raising questions about whether North Carolina’s “Ready to Open” process does enough to ensure new schools are prepared.
Statewide, new charter schools have enrolled an average of 13 percent fewer students than projected in their first year, and only about one in four met their initial targets — a gap that has widened over the past two years. Yet the Charter School Review Board and its predecessor have approved nearly every school recommended for final authorization, granting approval to 28 of 34 schools in the past five years.
The “Ready to Open” process is a yearlong planning and review period meant to ensure new charter schools are prepared to open. Now, the review board is weighing major changes to that process, which officials say are needed to tighten oversight and set clearer enrollment and budget standards.
“This is about sustainability,” said Ashley Logue, executive director of the N.C. Department of Public Instruction’s Office of Charter Schools, which oversees the RTO process. “We want readiness to be assessed based on concrete evidence and data.”
The proposed changes would move the process from flexible guidelines to clearer, stricter standards. Schools would make two in-person presentations — in May and June — instead of a single final review. The Office of Charter Schools is also recommending higher enrollment minimums and raising the break-even budget threshold to 100 students, above the 80 required by law.
Board Chair John Blackburn said the board will take a closer look at schools with weak progress on enrollment or facilities, and may require yearlong delays before opening.
Vice Chair John Eldridge said many applicants underestimate the challenges of opening a school. 
“A lot of folks out there think that the application is the hardest part,” Eldridge said. “They’re good people. They have good intentions, and they don’t realize what’s going to happen once the green light gets pushed.”
Both Blackburn and Eldridge said the state’s process, while imperfect, remains stronger than those in many other states. They cited lessons from a recent National Association of Charter School Authorizers conference, where they found North Carolina’s system comparatively thorough.
Eldridge said that in states like Arizona, charters are sometimes approved after a brief “Shark Tank”-style pitch session — a process he described as evidence of how “wild west” charter authorizing can be elsewhere.
“We left that event almost reaffirmed about our application process,” Blackburn said. “[It] can always be improved,  but it’s quite, in my opinion, strong compared to other states. We were rather stunned to hear and interact with other authorizers who were learning about basic things about the charter—its budget, its personnel plan, recruitment efforts—after the charter had already been given, rather than upfront.”
The North Carolina Coalition for Charter Schools, which represents charter operators statewide, said it supports the board’s effort to address the problem of schools that fail to meet enrollment goals, but the group cautioned against overregulation.
When new schools can’t open on time because of low enrollment, “It’s not good for the school and it’s not good for the students who expected to go to that school,” said Dave Machado, executive director of the coalition in a statement to NC Newsline.
“So the question is, how do you regulate enough to avoid that outcome, but not so much that you actually discourage new schools from trying to open in the first place?” Machado said.
Machado is a former member of the review board.
The review board will accept public comment over the next month before finalizing recommendations in December. If adopted, the new standards would take effect for schools opening in 2026.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AdobeStock_CharterSchool-wo.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Beer distributor Byron Schafersman said the availability of buzz-inducing “THC” seltzers that South Dakotans are increasingly finding at bars and liquor stores across the state is jeopardized by a provision in congressional legislation to reopen the federal government. 
“What I can tell you is consumers said loud and clear that they want this product,” said Schafersman, of Global Distributing, based in Renner. “And now it’s getting ripped away.” 
The provision could wipe out a whole range of hemp-based products ranging from those seltzers to lotions used for arthritis pain, according to Katie Sieverding, who lobbies on behalf of both the hemp industry and beer wholesalers in South Dakota.
“My fear is that we’re going to sweep in products that we weren’t even thinking about,” she said. 
The language in the U.S. Senate’s stopgap spending package — which was expected to gain approval from the House and President Trump on Wednesday night — caps the allowable high-inducing compound (known as THC) in any hemp-derived consumer product at 0.4 milligrams per container. That’s a fraction of what’s found in the 5- to 10-milligram beverages and gummies, for example, now sold in stores. It’s also less than what is found in many of the non-high-inducing “CBD” products, often sold as pain-relieving oils, lotions and balms, according to Josh Schneider, the policy adviser for the National Industrial Hemp Council.
Schneider said the U.S. hemp industry generates roughly $26 billion annually, with “well over $25 billion” tied to hemp-derived compounds like CBD and THC. Schneider said the new cap would dismantle those markets, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and strand years of investment in processing and extraction facilities.
Hemp in South Dakota
While Sieverding said most of the hemp grown in South Dakota is for grain and fiber, a small share of South Dakota hemp farmers do rely on CBD and hemp-derived THC products. 
Production of hemp, which is low in THC, was federally authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, which defined hemp as cannabis with no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. The intent was to legalize non-intoxicating uses like hemp fiber for things like clothing and CBD for things like joint pain relief. But critics say it also created a loophole: manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Since then, hemp-derived products with intoxicating effects have taken off.

In South Dakota, hemp became legal to grow in 2021, and the state now harvests more hemp for fiber than any other.
Ken Meyer, a board member of the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association and co-chair of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable’s Farmer Advisory Council, said most South Dakota hemp is grown for grain and fiber, not for use in intoxicating products. Regardless, he said the change would devastate small retailers that serve clients who don’t want to obtain a patient card for medical marijuana, which has been allowed in South Dakota since the state started its medical marijuana program in 2021.
“These are adults who don’t want to go to dispensaries,” Meyer said. “They just want something to help them relax or manage pain.”
‘Every AG is seeing it’
A Nov. 4 letter from 39 state attorneys general, including South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, urged Congress to close the hemp-derived THC “loophole.”
“This is something that we in the attorney general community have been dealing with, especially with the sale of these products to minors,” Jackley said. “Every AG is seeing it.” 
South Dakota legislators passed a law in 2024 that closed a portion of the loophole by banning chemically synthesized versions of THC, sold under names like Delta-8 and THC-O, sometimes called “diet weed.” Jackley’s office recently conducted a sting and found five smoke shops allegedly in violation of that law.

Jackley said South Dakota’s hemp industry should remain focused on agricultural and industrial uses, not the sale of “these dangerous chemicals marketed to minors.” He said people in need of those products can apply for a medical marijuana card. 
News welcomed by medical marijuana industry
Ned Horsted runs 605 Cannabis, which grows medical marijuana and has a medical dispensary in the state. He called the federal legislation “encouraging,” given that his industry is tightly regulated and tested — which is costly — and he views it as unfair that comparable legal standards for hemp-derived intoxicating products were not being applied. 
“We need a free and fair market,” he said.

Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation

Horsted was involved with an unsuccessful past effort to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. He said if that effort had succeeded, today’s “loophole” would not have have transformed into the market it has in South Dakota.
“Our bill said you would have to be 21 to buy any of this, and there would be far more oversight and regulation than what is on the products that are currently alleviating consumers’ demand for THC,” he said. 
Horsted noted that South Dakota’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee has heard numerous complaints during its last two meetings that “smoke shops” are selling illegal and intoxicating products, often getting into the hands of minors. 
At its Nov. 4 meeting, members approved a motion urging the creation of an interim study committee to investigate the issue and another recommending that sales of THC products be limited to licensed medical marijuana dispensaries.
Smoke shops and CBD
Caleb Rose helps run what some people describe as a “smoke shop,” selling hemp-derived THC products ranging from CBD to gummies and vapes. He is part-owner of Black Hills Vapors and Black Hills CBD. 
Rose said that because the proposed THC cap applies per container, it will mean many non-intoxicating CBD products he sells will no longer be available.
“We’re going to lose a lot of those topical products that are completely non-psychoactive,” he said. 
He said there would still be legal CBD options, but they would be costly and may be less effective. 
Rose estimated a 30% hit to his business and argued that the biggest losers are people using THC seltzers and gummies as “better alternatives” to things like drinking alcohol or pain-relieving pharmaceuticals.
Bad for beverage sales
Schafersman’s Global Distributing sells 5- to 10-milligram, hemp-derived THC seltzers. He emphasized that the products are low-dose, contrasting them with some higher-milligram vapes and edibles sold at “smoke shops.” 
He also said beverages are a safer, more controllable way to consume THC than gummies or vapes, particularly due to the physical limits on overconsumption, noting, “a child can’t just go and chug 10 of these at a time.” The company has turned down offers to sell drinks with higher milligram levels.
“We’ve concluded smaller milligrams is a key to us making sure that people have a good experience and they’re not overconsuming,” Schafersman said.
He said the nation’s alcohol distribution model is already designed to keep products out of kids’ hands.

 “I’m not selling this to anybody who doesn’t have a liquor license. Nobody who doesn’t have a beer license. I’m not selling it to the little pot shops,” he said. 
Schafersman said that while demand for alcohol has decreased, especially among younger people, there is growing adult consumer demand for THC beverages. He said the federal legislation will force layoffs if it becomes law.

 “It’s going to be a huge, huge negative for us at Global Distributing,” he said. “This is a multi-million dollar market in the state.”

The federal grand jury indictment accuses Williamson and four other co-conspirators, including Becerra’s former chief of staff, of funneling $225,000 in money from a dormant campaign account. Williamson is also accused of falsely claiming more than $1 million in business expenses on her taxes, which were instead used to purchase luxury handbags, charter jets and a nearly $170,000 birthday trip to Mexico.


Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, and three co-conspirators were indicted Wednesday on 23 counts of bank and wire fraud, allegedly committed from 2022 to 2024, during her time working for the governor. 
The indictment, first reported by the Sacramento Bee, alleges that Williamson, a longtime Democratic strategist, worked with Greg Campbell, a prominent Sacramento lobbyist, and Sean McCluskie, the former chief of staff to former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, as well as two other unnamed co-conspirators to steal $225,000 from an unnamed former official’s dormant campaign account for McCluskie’s personal use.
“Collectively, they funneled the money through various business entities and disguised it as pay for what was, in reality, a no-show job,” FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a news release. 
Prosecutors allege that Williamson and one of the unnamed co-conspirators, described only as a former California public official who owned a political consulting firm, used their political strategy firms to funnel money out of a campaign account, believed to be Becerra’s, into an account controlled by McCluskie. They allegedly disguised the funds as payments for McCluskie’s spouse, who was described in the indictment as a stay-at-home parent.
Williamson is also accused of falsely claiming more than $1.7 million in business expenses on her taxes. She used the funds to purchase luxury handbags, chartered jets and a nearly $170,000 birthday trip to Mexico, the indictment alleges.
Williamson, wearing what appeared to be a gray robe and in shackles, broke into tears from time to time at her arraignment hearing Wednesday afternoon in Sacramento. She pleaded not guilty to the charges and her attorney demanded a jury trial. Williamson is expected to be released on a $500,000 unsecured bond and put her house up as collateral. She has until Nov. 26 to post bond.
She will be released under supervision and must surrender her passport and other travel documents, among other conditions for her release. Her attorney, Matthew Rowan, declined to speak to reporters following the arraignment.
Williamson, who previously held a high-level position in Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration, was well known for her negotiating ability. When she left his office, Newsom said in a statement that he would miss her “insight, tenacity and big heart.”
The indictment indicated that Becerra had no knowledge of the scheme, and he confirmed as much Wednesday afternoon in a written statement via his spokesperson, Owen Kilmer.
“The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,” said Becerra, a prominent candidate to succeed Newsom in next year’s gubernatorial election. He added that he had fully cooperated with the U.S. Justice Department and would continue to do so. 
“As California’s former Attorney General, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.”
A spokesperson for Newsom distanced the governor from his former top aide. 
“While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity,” said Izzy Gardon, Newsom’s spokesperson, in a written statement. 
“At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one’s peers,” the statement said. 
Patel, the special agent in charge, said in a news release that the charges were “the result of three years of relentless investigative work.”
Prosecuting attorney Michael Anderson said Wednesday that prosecutors will hand over more than 27,000 pages of documents and an additional 750 gigabytes of evidence related to the case as part of the discovery process.

Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year is thrown into disarray.,"HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE advanced a major bill that could scale back the state’s ambitious efforts to fight climate change.  
House members of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy greenlit the measure, H.3469, sponsored by Mark Cusack, the Braintree Democrat who co-chairs the panel. Seven House members of the committee, all Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, while four reps held back from casting an up or down vote, according to Ana Vivas, a spokesperson for House Speaker Ron Mariano.  
Cusack previously told CommonWealth Beacon, which first reported the legislative effort, that he is aiming to move the measure out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19. 
Wednesday’s vote is the first sign that Cusack’s legislation, which would cut the state’s energy efficiency program and could render its 2030 climate mandate unenforceable, has some legs among Democrats, many of whom voted for those goals just four years ago, and is gaining traction in the House.  
And it’s a concrete signal of the political muscle being exerted by at least one part of the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill to soften its commitment to fight climate change and invest in clean energy in the name of energy affordability. 
The legislation, which CommonWealth Beacon obtained on Monday, details a scenario in which the state’s 2030 climate commitment to halve pollution compared to 1990 levels could become “advisory” if those goals are missed because of actions taken by the federal government. President Trump has kneecapped the clean energy transition by halting new offshore wind permits and pulling money meant to spur uptake in solar power and electric vehicles. 
Cusack’s bill also caps the Mass Save program at $4 billion, a $500 million cut from its current budget, and rolls back the amount of renewable energy that utilities are required to purchase.  
The measure is ushering in an unexpected — and messy — debate over the state’s overall policy push to meet its 2030 climate commitments as Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year is thrown into disarray. 
Cusack is moving forward with an entirely new bill tackling affordability outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint energy committee, Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat. The bill would eventually still need Senate approval to become law, however, something that is likely a long shot. 
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack previously said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.”  
Environmental advocates, who were quick to react to Cusack’s plan with vows to fight it, are planning a rally at the State House on Thursday, according to an invitation viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
On Thursday, the joint energy committee will hold its first hearing since Cusack went public with his plan. He and Barrett are both expected there.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/State-House-at-night.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

He's a Cuban ICE detainee in Torrance County Detention Center and says employees have denied him access to important legal documents ahead of a Thursday deportation hearing. (Courtesy Haymel de la Vega)A Cuban immigrant held in a Torrance County immigrant detention center faces a key court hearing Thursday without what he described as crucial legal documents to help him avoid deportation.
Rogelio Bolufé told Source New Mexico in a phone interview in Spanish on Tuesday that an abruptly cancelled meeting with a legal aid group last week hobbled his chances at convincing an immigration judge to spare him deportation to Cuba, where he says he’ll face imprisonment and torture as a political dissident. 
“If I go back to Cuba, my life will be in danger,” he said.
His allegations of denied access to lawyers and legal materials occur as the facility, one of three ICE lockups in the state, operates without a contract. It currently holds about 550 ICE detainees.
Amid a federal government shutdown, an inter-governmental services agreement between the county, ICE and private prison operator CoreCivic expired Oct. 31, and it remains unclear when it will be renewed. 
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter to ICE on Friday demanding the agency answer what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

“I reiterate my calls for ICE to close the facility, but if you will not, I urge you to transfer all ICE detainees out of TCDF immediately until such time that the contract between ICE and Torrance County is extended,” Heinrich wrote. 
Innovation Law Lab, an organization of immigrant legal advocates who visit the jail weekly, have said ICE’s own policies require the agency to remove detainees and their equipment absent a contract. 
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry Wednesday about Heinrich’s letter, which cites recent Source New Mexico reporting and public statements from ICE about its continued operations during the shutdown. Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, said Wednesday that ICE hadn’t responded to the senator’s office yet. 
Bolufé, 43, told Source the contract’s expiration worsened a long practice of officials’ denying legal help to him or his fellow detainees, including a canceled meeting with legal advocates last Thursday. Bolufé documented that incident and others in a letter last week to Source signed by six other immigrant detainees. 
Bolufé’s letter also cited poor quality telephone communication; jail staff disruptions to consultations with legal staff; and lack of access to the jail’s legal library.
“In practice, it is impossible to access the legal library,” Bolufé wrote, noting he made 30 requests through jail tablets for appointments at the legal library and received no response.
Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s close friend and former fianceé, facilitated brief jail phone calls between Bolufé and Source this week and sent Source letters detailing his history in ICE custody. She wrote that she’s tried to send books and other legal materials to Bolufé at the facility without success.
“I have personally sent Rogelio several legal books and materials intended to support his preparation for court, but these have been withheld pending review and approval by the facility’s director, and as of today, they have not been delivered to him,” she wrote on Nov. 7.
Rubena Miranda, administrative supervisor at the facility, declined to comment Wednesday, and referred comment to public affairs officials at CoreCivic. CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company would provide a response, but had not by publication. Source will update the story if it is received. 
A long journey to NM
Bolufé arrived at the Torrance County jail about two months ago and, he says, has spent some of his time collecting testimony from inmates who, like him, spent time at “Alligator Alcatraz.”
According to Bolufé, he spent between seven and 10 days in “Alligator Alcatraz,” during which he was chained by his hands and feet for 24 to 36 hours at a time. The facility had freezing temperatures, inadequate blankets and the lights remained on permanently. 
As a result of the treatment, he said he lost mobility in his left hand, as well as other pain, numbness and muscle weakness, and jail guards shouted racist slurs at him and other detainees. 
Bolufé said the letters and accounts of abuse would help him plead his case to federal immigration Judge Brock E. Taylor, and bring the allegations about ICE’s treatment of detainees to the judge’s attention, but they are among the materials he has yet to receive, along with a character reference signed by 40 people. He also intends on Thursday to argue that he would be subject to political persecution upon being deported to Cuba.
Bolufé is seeking a Green Card under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which allows Cubans a streamlined path to permanent residency. While he acknowledges and media reports confirm that he has long-standing ties to former Cuban President Fidel Castro and his sons, he also said he is waging a campaign to liberate the country from the Communist regime and supports President Donald Trump. 
Bolufé said his Green Card application was pending when he was arrested in the Miami area in August, accused of possessing a small amount of cocaine. He denies the cocaine belonged to him, and the charges have since been dropped, according to court records. Prosecutors in Miami-Dade County did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request on Wednesday about the case.
Ahead of the court hearing Thursday, Bolufé said he is hoping for the best, but he said his case is just one of many of immigrants who have been subject to abuse, deprived of human rights and threatened with deportation without having committed crimes.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Clay Schexnayder, former speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, was charged with felony theft Wednesday in connection with a missing piece of historic cypress that had been on display at the State Capitol and was last seen at his legislative office in Gonzales.
An East Baton Rouge Parish grand jury handed down an indictment against Schexnayder, 56, accusing him of felony theft and malfeasance in office. The felony charge applies to items having a value of $25,000 or more. 
The Advocate first reported in September on the disappearance of the 20-foot by 6-foot piece of cypress, taken from a tree believed to have been nearly 1,300 years old when it was harvested in 1936 from the swamps of Lake Maurepas. The board was gifted to the state in 1955 by Walter Stebbins and placed in a showcase on the ground floor of the State Capitol until about 15 to 20 years ago.
Stebbins’ grandson, Dr. Julius Mullins of Baton Rouge, reached out to state officials to help locate the missing cypress. He got his first break in the case when he saw Schexnayder on television being interviewed at his office, and the cypress board was in the background.
Schexnayder told the newspaper one of his predecessors as speaker, Rep. Chuck Kleckley of Lake Charles, had given him the board in 2013 for his legislative office because Schexnayder represented Ascension Parish, the area where the cypress had grown. Kleckley has said he doesn’t recall that account of how the board ended up in Schexnayder’s possession. 
Schexnayder, who reached his term limit last year, did not respond immediately to a call and text message. He told WAFB-TV on Wednesday he doesn’t know what happened to the board after he vacated his office. 
“I left the board and computer stuff there for the state to pick up,” Schexnayder said. “I left it there like any representative does. What happened to it, I don’t know.”
The property manager of the strip center that included Schexnayder’s office told The Advocate his employees did not remove it.  
Attorney General Liz Murrill, who was among the state officials Dr. Stebbins asked for assistance to find the cypress piece, sought the indictment against Schexnayder.
“You don’t get to keep State property. It doesn’t belong to you,” Murrill said through her spokesman.   
Schexnayder said he has only received one call from the attorney general’s office about locating the cypress, adding that he is willing to work with the agency to recover it.
“I’m very shocked and would have thought they would have followed up with me or had a sitdown meeting,” he said. “I told them I was willing to help them find it, but there’s been no follow up.”
Schexnayder, a Republican, held the House speaker’s post from 2020-24 with the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. He had represented House District 81, which included Ascension, Livingston, St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes, since 2012.
Although the House Republican Caucus and state GOP power brokers endorsed Rep. Sherman Mack, R-Albany for the speaker’s role, Schexnayder emerged as a compromise candidate who gained votes from all 35 House Democrats and 23 Republicans. Mack received the other 45 Republican votes.
In 2023, Schexnayder ran for Louisiana secretary of state and finished fourth in the primary election.
During his time as speaker. Schexnayder created controversy when he hired his stepsons to remodel his two apartments in the Pentagon Barracks housing that lawmakers use. The state refused to pay for the work, leaving Schexnayder responsible for covering the $48,000 cost.

(Photo by Larry N Young/Getty Images)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wildlands Defense, Native Ecosystems Council, and Council for Wildlife and Fish sued the U.S. Forest Service in federal district court in Utah for approving logging and burning throughout the Dixie National Forest’s Pine Valley Ranger District in southeast Utah. Kevin Wright, supervisor for the Dixie National Forest, authorized the project’s implementation by signing a Decision Notice in May 2025.
The project will log, masticate, roller mulch, and burn 127,667 acres, which is a substantial portion of the 209,731 acres of the Pine Valley Ranger District.
It’s scientifically shown that logging and burning may actually increase the severity of wildfires by opening up the forest floor to more solar radiation and wind. But we are challenging the Forest Service in court because it’s violating the Dixie National Forest Plan, which has specific requirements for Northern Goshawk, big game winter range, and old growth habitat.
Plan would destroy old growth forests that are critical to Northern Goshawk and Pinyon Jay habitat
The Dixie Forest Plan requires the agency to maintain at least the minimum level of goshawk habitat needed to ensure a viable population. Yet the Forest Service failed to even estimate how much habitat is required for goshawks according to the best available science, or how much habitat will be destroyed by the project.
The Dixie National Forest Plan requires the agency to manage each drainage in the forest to ensure that 7% to 10% are old growth forests. The agency’s own data shows that the forest currently has less mature and old growth than required. In spite of this, the Pine Valley project calls for logging and burning even more of what’s left of the old growth forest.
The sad fact is that goshawk numbers have plummeted. Given that goshawks are very specifically dependent on mature and old growth forests, which are already severely lacking in the Dixie National Forest, the project would only result in even more destruction of critical goshawk habitat.
Moreover, Pinyon Jay populations have nosedived — plummeting by over 85% in the last 50 years — mainly due to habitat loss caused by Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management deforestation projects. Yet this project will add to that decline by destroying the very pinyon pine and juniper trees that Pinyon Jays rely on to survive.
Big game will suffer
Much to the disappointment of hunters, the Dixie National Forest’s deer population was at 57,000 in 2023. That’s 10,000 deer below their objective. The Forest Plan requirement for big game habitat requires the agency to maintain at least 30% of shrub plants in a mature age, and at least 10% in a young stage in big game winter range.
Yet the agency’s knee-jerk reaction to this population decline is to burn even more of the juniper and other forage plants that deer need to survive the winter. Last summer a lightning-caused fire already burned through the roadless areas in Pine Valley. Hunters surely can’t be happy that the federal government wants to spend their tax dollars destroying even more big game habitat.
Plan won’t reduce wildfires — but will harm public health
The Forest Service claims they are doing this to protect homes from wildfire. But the agency’s top wildfire scientist found the only way to effectively protect homes from wildfires is by having nonflammable roofs and decks and trimming shrubs and trees up to 100 feet out from a house. Anything beyond that is a waste of money and destroys wildlife habitat.
The Forest Service estimates it will take 10 years to complete the project, which means people in southeast Utah will have to suffer through 10 springs and falls of smoke-filled air. According to Dr. Brian Moench of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment: “Prescribed burns have never been shown to reduce the public’s overall exposure to forest fire smoke. In fact, a recent study found that as many people die from prescribed burn smoke as from wildfire smoke. It’s unfortunate that the only way to protect public health from 10 years of Forest Service malpractice is to take them to court.”
Forest Service already lost on these same issues in 2006
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the Alliance and against the Dixie National Forest on these same issues in 2006. Yet the Forest Service is routinely operating outside the law by destroying wildlife and their habitat. By doing so the federal government is forcing grassroots forest activists to exercise our First Amendment rights and the citizen enforcement provisions in the law to challenge their decision in court. That’s exactly what we’re doing.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1295640096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

ST. JOHNSBURY — There’s a special election happening this week, and it’s just for fifth graders. More than 1,000 fifth graders across the state are casting their ballots for Vermont’s first Kid Governor. It’s part of a new civic education program led by the Office of the Vermont Secretary of State. Vermont joins Connecticut, New Hampshire, Nebraska and Oklahoma as one of five states with a Kid Governor program.
On October 16, fifth graders at the St. Johnsbury School held a primary to elect their school’s nominee. 
Kara Abare was one of the candidates. 
“I noticed a lot of things in Vermont, and some of them weren’t so good,” Kara said. “And I was like, ‘We need to fix that.’ So then I started running.” 
The St. Johnsbury School is one of 65 Vermont elementary schools involved in the Kid Governor program. Any fifth grade class — including homeschool groups — can sign up to participate. Students learn about state government and elections using free materials provided by the Kid Governor program and the state.
Then, at some schools, students build platforms around an issue they care about. Student candidates campaign at their schools, and then seven finalists move on to a statewide election, where all the students vote. The winner becomes Kid Governor, the six runners-up form a cabinet, and together they spend a year working with state officials to bring their ideas to life.

Robyn Palmer is the director of civic and voter engagement at the Office of the Vermont Secretary of State. She helped start the Kid Governor program in Vermont, and she and other state officials will work with the winning students after the election. 
“We’ll have monthly meetings where we go over their platform and help them put it into practice,” she said.
Palmer said the Secretary of State’s office appreciates that the Kid Governor program is more than just reading about civics in a textbook. “Yes, it’s learning about how elections work,” she said. “But really, it’s focused more on helping students identify a topic that they’re passionate about, and then think about ways that they can make a difference about it.” 
Palmer said she’s been surprised by how much interest there’s been in the program in its first year. “Our goal was to get at least seven schools signed on for our pilot year,” Palmer said. “And without that much work, we got 65 schools signed on almost immediately, all across the state.”

She’s also been surprised by the big issues students are addressing in their campaigns, like homelessness and food insecurity. 
Kara Abare’s platform tackled one big issue — health insurance.
“About 20,000 people don’t have [health insurance] in Vermont, and that’s a lot of people,” she said. Kara Abare’s classmate, Max Cloutier, also focused on healthcare. “My dad was diagnosed with a disease that can’t be cured,” he said. “And my platform is to try and help the people who try to cure those diseases, to help them do their work.”
Pam Letourneau-Fallon is one of the fifth grade teachers at the St. Johnsbury School. She actually encouraged the Vermont Secretary of State’s office to adopt the Kid Governor program. She used to teach in Connecticut, where Kid Governor started.

She loves the program because of its hands-on approach and real-world application. “This is not a pretend election,” she said. “The stakes are high. Their platforms will become a reality.”
She said the stakes are high for another reason, too. According to Vermont’s 2025 Youth Civic Health Survey, fewer than 60% of Vermont youth say they plan to register to vote when they’re old enough. 
“I believe the Kid Governor program is going to dramatically increase those numbers,” Pam Letourneau-Fallon said. “I can’t see any of these students not voting in elections moving forward. They’re invested.”
None of the St. Johnsbury students advanced to the statewide election for Kid Governor. Still, Kara Abare said, the process taught her a lot about leadership. “A good leader, for me, it means making an example for yourself so others can look up to you and do the same things you’re doing,” she said. “Like, if you’re nice and kind, then they’ll be like, ‘Wow, I want to be like Kara,’ and then they’ll be nice and kind.”
The polls close today, and the Secretary of State’s office is set to announce the election results on November 19. The new Kid Governor will take office in January, following an inauguration ceremony at the Statehouse.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — While they did not see eye-to-eye on much, a Louisville Republican and Democrat both said that increasing housing stock should be a priority for Kentucky’s legislature in 2026.
During a Louisville Forum luncheon panel on Wednesday, two Republican and two Democratic state lawmakers largely disagreed when it came to changes to Medicaid backed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress earlier this year. But the lawmakers did find some common ground in wanting to better their communities in the state’s largest city. 
Kentucky Today Editor Lawrence Smith moderated the panel, which included Republicans Majority House Whip Rep. Jason Nemes and Sen. Julie Raque Adams and Democrats Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong and Rep. Joshua Watkins. The discussion served as a preview of topics in store for the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. Lawmakers will decide the next two-year state budget, meaning that significant dollars can be allocated to various programs, resources and projects across the state. 
Nemes said that a priority for him is “bringing home as much money to Louisville as I can,” earning some applause from the luncheon crowd. He added that he views Louisville as the “economic engine” of the state. 
Raque Adams said there is a “push-pull between this urban and rural divide.” However, she said Louisville’s downtown “fared really well” as the General Assembly allocated $100 million across two years to revitalize the area in 2024. 
“Our General Assembly is primarily made up of rural legislators, and so a lot of times when the budget comes over from the House, our metropolitan areas don’t fare as well,” she said. “And so we really have to work together, House and Senate, to make sure” metropolitan areas are not left out. d.” 
Raque Adams also said that suburbs should get more attention in the budget this year, particularly when it comes to developing more housing. 
Chambers Armstrong said “Kentucky only succeeds when we take care of our neighbors and when we show up for each other.” She was critical of federal changes to Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that could lead to rural health care providers losing money and hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians losing Medicaid coverage. 
Chambers Armstrong said she would file a constitutional amendment to keep the state’s Medicaid expansion intact and a bill to increase diaper access for low-income families. However, she is a member of the minority party in a state legislature with GOP supermajorities. 
She said she’s hoping to see a state budget “that reflects our Kentucky values and puts loyalty to D.C. or an administration aside to say, ‘We take care of our people, we show up for our people, and we invest in folks,’ because that means investing in our state.” 
Watkins said he agreed with much of what other lawmakers said but stressed that affordable housing is a “paramount” priority for his district. He is a Realtor and a member of the Kentucky Housing Task Force, a special legislative committee. 
“We have our different opinions about what’s happening in Washington, but if we don’t get serious about housing, we won’t have a Kentucky that our future generations will be proud of.” 
One Big Beautiful Bill Act
Raque Adams and Nemes accused Democrats of using a “scare tactic” by saying Kentuckians would lose coverage and hospitals would close. Both Republicans said that the Republican changes would help make Medicaid “sustainable” in the long run. Raque Adams said Republicans will file a bill in the statehouse that focuses on redetermination and eligibility for Medicaid recipients as well as legislation to permanently put into state law work requirements for working age, non-disabled Medicaid recipients.
Nemes said Medicaid is “not managed appropriately, and it’s time that we make a significant review of it, which is what we’re doing in the General Assembly.” 
Chambers Armstrong said that her position was “not a scare tactic” and pointed out that UofL Health delayed a South End birthing center project “indefinitely” following Congress approving the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She also argued that the legislature’s failure to raise the minimum wage has not helped Kentucky workers. 
“This is not something that is happening a long time from now. This is not something that is happening to other people. This is something that’s happening to our neighbors and our community. And I believe that it is the job of our General Assembly to protect Kentuckians and to stand up when the federal government is doing things that are going to hurt our people.”
Taxes
Republicans in the General Assembly have successfully passed reductions in the state income tax in recent years, with the goal of ultimately eliminating it altogether. However, the state’s revenue and budget numbers for the last fiscal year did not meet the legislature’s self-imposed threshold for considering another income tax rate cut in the 2026 session. 
But Nemes said he does “not accept the premise that we didn’t meet the requirement this year because of emergencies.” State tax deadlines were delayed due to severe storms, and Nemes maintains that the state should “re-measure” the budget for an income tax reduction next year. 
“I’m fully for a reduction of another full half of a percent, from 3.5% to 3%. … But if I can’t convince my colleagues to go down a full half of a percent, we need to go down a quarter of a percent,” Nemes said. 
Chambers Armstrong said that the “people who benefit the most” from lowering the state income tax are “the folks who need the benefit the least” and that income tax cuts don’t do much to help poor and low-income Kentuckians. She added that she thinks it “would be irresponsible” to permanently change state tax policy now with federal funding still up in the air. 
Watkins agreed with and added that there are ways other than lower taxes to attract businesses to Kentucky. “A business thinks about quality of life for its workers and its families,” he said. “If you don’t have the neighborhoods to live in, if your people can’t find health care … businesses think about that.” 
Louisville schools
Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest public school district, often gets the attention of the General Assembly. Asked if lawmakers are still thinking about breaking up the school district, Nemes praised the work by new Superintendent Brian Yearwood to increase student performance. 
Out of respect to Yearwood, Nemes said he would not “be the catalyst” for such legislation to disband the school district within the next year, but “if we don’t get it in the right direction, something has to happen.” 
Watkins, the only Black lawmaker on the panel, said that teachers are “having to do more today than they ever had to do when I was in school.” He added that on top of educating students, teachers are asked to support students without proper resources and that criticism of the Louisville schools often comes with a racial subtext.
“When we talk about the success of JCPS and its failures, oftentimes we are couched in discussions in communities and households with peoples and families and students that look like me. And when we think about the progress that JCPS has had with what it has to do as a public school system, that’s very different from a private school.”
Raque Adams said she agreed with Watkins and argued that the school district has had “an explosion in Central Office and no money going to the classroom, going to the teachers, going to the schools,” referring to the higher salaries of administrators compared to most other employees. 
Chambers Armstrong also highlighted a proposal for universal Pre-K programs backed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. She said that can be a way to invest early in a child’s education and set them up for success later in life. 
Transparency
Shortly before the panel began, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky released an updated report on lack of transparency in Kentucky’s legislative process. The report expanded on issues the group highlighted at the end of the 2025 legislative session, such as fast-tracking bills in a manner that limits public notice and participation. 
Chambers Armstrong said she had not read the latest report but was familiar with the group’s previous ones. She recalled times when she felt legislation was being pushed through at a fast pace forcing her to quickly read through a bill that she just received before it was called to the Senate floor. 
“The way we get good legislation is we tell folks early and loudly what we’re working on, and we ask for experts to give us insight and feedback, and we change our legislation in response to that,” she said. When we rush legislation through, and we’re just trying to get it done and we’re cramming it in secret under the cover of night, that’s not good policy.” 
Raque Adams said she experienced what Chambers Armstrong described when she was a member of the House while Democrats were the majority party. She added that she believes most lawmakers “really do have good intentions, and they really try to do the right thing.” 
“It happens and it’s unfortunate. I think we all want it to be very transparent in the way that it’s supposed to be. But sometimes you’re under a constitutional deadline, and so you’re rushing to get things done, or you’re rushing to fix a bill, or you’re rushing to do that, and it’s unfortunate.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5432-e1762982695287-1024x765.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

In a hospital room a year ago, Tlingit elder, water protector, and artist John Morris Sr. and I made a special discovery. Even though we’d talked many times about our connections to the Taku River, I’d forgotten to tell him about the woman’s decorative hair comb I’d uncovered in the dirt near the mouth of the Taku years earlier. I finally asked John if he recognized the name neatly etched on the back of this comb.
“Ah, that’s my grandmother! She must’ve lost it 70 years ago,” said John, tearing up. “She would load up the family into boats at our Douglas Island village, Akáx Yaa Andagán, so we all could go pick berries in August, before the coho started to swim upriver.”
John closed his eyes and cradled his grandmother’s comb, and asked me to tell him another Taku story.
I recounted a recent swim at Taku Harbor, where I’ve spent virtually every summer of my life. Wearing a wetsuit and goggles, I had slipped into the frigid, forest-ringed ocean, only about 100 feet from where I found the comb. I swam farther than normal that day and stopped, stunned, when the salty water suddenly turned sweet. It smelled and tasted of Sitka spruce needles, wild carrot blossoms, and watermelon berries. With a flash of excitement and recognition, I realized I was smelling the glacial stream that has raised generations of wild salmon flooding into the bay.
John opened his eyes and beamed. “I’ll be darned. Yes, I know just that sweet smell. Keep sharing your love of your home, of salmon rivers, Heather. You’ll remind others to speak of their love, too.”
John died three months later. His last words to me continue to reverberate in my mind and heart.
The big, braided T’aakū (Taku), Shtax’heen (Stikine), Joonáx̱ (Unuk), and Salmon Rivers, some of the last largely intact salmon rivers left on the planet, flow from British Columbia, Canada, across the border, and into Southeast Alaska and the Tongass National Forest. Indigenous nations like the Tlingit and the Tahltan have stewarded these wild, glaciated river valleys — collectively the size of Portugal — since time immemorial.
And here, in an ironic and miraculous piece of good climate news, scientists predict thousands of miles of new cold, clear water for salmon will emerge as vast glaciers melt — unless Canada permits mining companies to dig them up first.
Mining companies, rebranding this region as the “The Golden Triangle,” are  working hand-in-glove with the Canadian government to industrialize shared river valleys and build roads atop glaciers to extract tiny specks of gold and copper. Canada’s polluting gold mining boom upstream has largely escaped the world’s wider notice. Today more than 100 Canadian gold mine projects, most with massive earthen mine waste dams, are being explored or are operating here.
The Canadian government is incentivizing and fast-tracking this mining boom without the consent of all who are deeply connected to this place. A couple of years ago, I asked a CEO who will benefit from his proposed gold mine located just upstream of a vast emerald green wetland and refuge for salmon fry. He paused, laughed nervously, and replied, “Our investors.”
The “sweet water” smells John and I know well call the salmon home. Newly-hatched, inch-long salmon fry imprint the smells of the stream where they’re born in their olfactory systems before migrating to sea. Years later, this deep memory and the earth’s magnetic field guide salmon thousands of miles from the open ocean back to their birth streams to lay their eggs, but only as long as contaminants haven’t polluted this freshwater.
Unfortunately, these waterways, and salmon’s ability to navigate through them, are threatened with permanent mine contamination like acid rock drainage.
For decades, people have called for slowing Canada’s gold fever in this region. Many Alaskans and Alaska tribes have called for a pause in upstream Canadian mining until Indigenous peoples and communities on both sides of the border develop binding protections for shared rivers.
Native and local people sustained by salmon rivers like the Taku, Stikine, Unuk, and Salmon Rivers should determine their future  — not the distant corporations, hedge funds, and billionaire financiers behind today’s modern-day gold rush.
Amidst the current loud, constant push for power and profits, wild salmon quietly fill us with awe and are reminders of true wealth. As my friend John urged me, I will be speaking up for wild salmon rivers even more passionately than before.

By a 10-2 vote, the council backed the $9 million transfer of Vibra Hospital of Western Massachusetts and the Meadows nursing home in Leicester, along with the property they occupy. Some council members raised concerns about staffing and the financial stability of the facilities.
Everest Hospital LLC plans to take over operations of the 47-bed hospital, which serves patients with serious medical conditions requiring ongoing but non-intensive care. The company has pledged to retain all existing Vibra staff. According to a Public Health Council staff report about the application, Everest is not associated with private equity.
In that same report, Everest said that if the sale did not proceed, “Vibra would continue to operate the Hospital without the Proposed Project; however, the [nursing home]… likely would have been at risk for closure if Vibra had been unable to find a buyer.”
Council members pressed for details about the proposed transfer.
Mary Moscato, a long-term care management expert on the council, said she was concerned about the operators’ lack of Massachusetts experience, given the state’s complex regulatory landscape. Moscato, along with Lisa Blondet of the Massachusetts Association of Community Health Workers, voted against the transfer.
“I do feel that that is a concern going forward, especially from the applicant, who are three individuals who developed an LLC, Everest Hospital, in Massachusetts, and have not had any experience in operating health care centers in Massachusetts, and do not have any experience in operating long-term acute care hospitals,” Moscato said.
Everest’s three principals are Chaim Klein, a dentist, and Yisrael Klein and Yedidya Danziger, both of whom have administrative experience with skilled nursing facilities.
Danziger told the council that Everest plans to increase staffing to serve more patients. The hospital, licensed for 47 beds, is currently operating at roughly 50 percent occupancy under Vibra.
According to application materials, Vibra’s patient volume has declined since fiscal 2020. Everest called that drop “unusual” and attributed it to “staffing issues and the termination of a dialysis service provider who exited the business.” Dialysis services are expected to resume soon, which Everest said should help increase patient numbers.
By building a more stable workforce, Danziger said, the hospital would be able to serve more patients. 
“We’re going to go down to schools, we’re going to get schools to come in to do their rounds in the facility we intend to utilize, Indeed… directly recruit all forms of hiring with bonus structures and retention bonuses,” he said.
Vibra has relied heavily on travel nurses to staff the Leicester facilities, Danziger said. Everest plans to move toward a full-time workforce, staffing levels “accordingly” based on patient needs.
Many of Vibra’s travel nurses are local but employed through agencies, he added.
“Knowing they’re local makes a big difference, but I’m just puzzled as to why they would use an agency,” said council member Dr. Ramnath Subbaraman. “Generally travel nurses who are more mobile… they tend to cost a lot more. So it was a little puzzling to me why they would be using staff who are not more permanent if they are local.”
Danziger replied that “to be honest” he does not “fully understand as well” why Vibra relies on agency nurses.
“We honestly don’t understand fully why that’s being done, and that’s really why we wanted to try to bring them on board,” he said. “Because of what you’re saying. It’s significantly more expensive to have them through the travel agency… So I can’t fully answer that question, it predates our involvement.”
Everest’s application highlighted one advantage of the transfer: the operator would own both the hospital and nursing home, eliminating the role of Medical Properties Trust, the current landlord.
Medical Properties Trust was the landlord for hospitals operated by Steward Health Care in 2024 at the time that health system went bankrupt and collapsed, shuttering two Massachusetts hospitals in the process. 
“The real estate is not being held in a [Real Estate Investment Trust] and this Proposed Project would terminate Medical Properties Trust (Steward’s landlord) interest in the real property that it currently has with Vibra,” the application said. “The real property would be owned by the operator with no lease-back or unrelated third-party interests.”
The Health Policy Commission noted the deal is a cash transaction.
Moscato cautioned Danziger that Massachusetts’ long-term acute care hospital network “has little to no margin of operation.”
“Their operating budgets currently are very, very slim, if not negative,” she said. “Are you familiar with that? And upon taking this $9 million acquisition, that you might not get your return in many, many years?”
Danziger responded, “Absolutely, yes. It’s similar to any health facility when you initially take over any health facility, it’s expected that you don’t get returned for a very long time. So yes, we’re expecting that.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hospital.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 21:57:18+00:00,CT Mirror,New CT housing bill poised to pass House during special session,Ginny Monk and Josie Reich,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/ct-housing-bill-special-session/,"The bill is a compromise between lawmakers, local leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont after he vetoed a major housing bill during session this year.","The state House of Representatives on Wednesday was poised to pass a replacement for the broad housing bill that the governor vetoed in June, a moment that has been months in the making for many Democrats.
The bill requires towns to create housing growth programs, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
Lawmakers drafted House Bill 8002 as a compromise with local leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont after Lamont vetoed the housing bill passed during the regular session. The House of Representatives debated the bill for most of the day during a special session Wednesday.
“We’ve done a lot of compromise,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “We’ve come together and talked about a lot of the things that were in former House Bill 5002. Here, we’re talking about what really is at the heart of what we were doing here and what we are doing now, and that is housing growth.”
Democrats passed House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing bill, during the regular session. Lamont, whose staff had worked on the bill with lawmakers, vetoed the bill weeks later. The governor said he wanted to get towns on board, and called for a special session to pass a negotiated version of the bill.
On Friday, several town officials, including some Republicans, stood alongside House Democrats and Lamont to announce the new version of the bill.
Republicans and some moderate Democrats voted against the measure. Much of the debate focused on the shortened timeline to debate the bill during a special session and arguments from Republicans that the bill would ultimately hurt towns.
Republicans argued that the bill hadn’t been released with enough time for the public to review it and hadn’t gone through the public hearing process. Concepts in the bill got public hearings during the regular session.
“I’m super disappointed in the lack of transparency in Democratic level from the top all the way down,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a morning briefing that support for the bill was clear at Friday’s press conference, when groups that opposed the bill in the last legislative session showed up in support, including members of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and the Council of Small Towns.
“On the floor, people throw things, it’s bombastic, that’s the world we live in. There’s theater to it,” Ritter said. “But you just take a step back and go, look who got there. It truly is a compromise.”
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said that local leaders at the conference were supporting a bill they hadn’t read, because copies had not yet been released.
“We have one-party rule in the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said. “So I’m guessing these individuals didn’t feel like they actually had a choice, and they had to try to get something for their communities, because the alternatives were much worse.”
Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said on Friday that there had been a bipartisan effort to find a solution that included Republican local leaders.
“We have leaders from the local level, from the regional level, certainly from the administration, from the legislature, advocates, all standing here trying to focus on the end game and focus on the prize,” Rojas said. “And the prize is advancing policy that creates homes for people and for families to live in here in Connecticut.”
CCM executive director Joe DeLong said town leaders with his organization as well as COST had worked on the legislation for months and offered multiple updates and presentations about the progress.
“Municipalities were in no way kept in the dark on any of this type of work,” DeLong said. He added that while there are some towns that would have preferred no bill pass, the issues raised were “systematically resolved” in the new bill.
COST executive director Betsy Gara said in a statement that there have been several improvements to the bill. 
“The bill is certainly not perfect, but it makes more sense from a planning standpoint. Our municipal leaders, as board members of their respective COGs [councils of government], have already been discussing ways of promoting housing development, including affordable housing, in their regions,” Gara said.
“The reality is that given broad support in the state legislature for a housing bill; something was going to pass. COST worked hard to mitigate some of the most onerous provisions in the bill to develop a more workable, balanced framework for addressing local and regional housing needs,” added Gara.
Still, some lawmakers opposed to the measure said they feared the bill would wrest power away from municipalities. Rep. Tina Courpas, R-Greenwich, said it was a “declaration of war” on towns.
“That destroys our longstanding tradition of home rule. It establishes an adversarial relationship between Hartford and the towns, which I do not think is beneficial to our communities, and it abrogates all of the local considerations and essentially sacrifices them at the altar of affordable housing,” Courpas said.
Supporters, as well as the organizations that represent towns, said local officials worked with lawmakers and the governor to develop the bill. Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, voted no on the old bill. She said the first selectman in her town, who spoke at the governor’s press conference last week, is now on board.
“I am grateful for the movement forward and for the opportunity to vote yes,” Berger-Girvalo said.
The bill says municipalities must either create a housing growth plan or participate in a regional housing growth plan. It includes specifications for what the plan must include, such as: what strategies the town will use to improve access to affordable housing, an inventory of developable land in the town and housing goals.
If towns do not create these plans, they are not eligible for temporary pauses from being sued by developers whose affordable housing plans are denied under the state’s affordable housing statute 8-30g.
The bill eliminates off-street parking minimums for residential developments with up to 16 units and allows towns to exempt two contiguous zones amounting to not more than 8% of the land.
In those zones, towns could require a parking needs assessment and developers would have to build no more than one parking space for each studio or 1-bedroom apartment and two spaces for each unit with two or more bedrooms, or the number recommended by a parking needs assessment paid for the developer. The requirement would be for whichever number is lower.
For towns that participate in certain types of zoning that increases density near transit hubs, the conversion of commercial to residential must be allowed for up to nine units, but the town can require that the ground floor stay commercial.
The bill also allows towns to access new state money if they comply with the housing growth plan requirements, meet specifications to allow more housing near train and bus stations or join the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority to increase density near public transit and downtown.
It says that towns with populations of 15,000 or more must create fair rent commissions or join a regional commission. Current law says towns with 25,000 or more residents must have these commissions. 
It establishes the Department of Housing as a statewide housing authority that can develop affordable housing on state land and in towns. It also bans “hostile architecture,” or tools such as armrests in the middle of benches or spikes that make it hard for people experiencing homelessness to rest or lie down.
“We are very excited that we have finally gotten to this point, and I am certainly grateful for all of the people who are standing here today, but I do want us to focus on the fact that the people who are not standing here today are the people who are counting on us and who have been counting on us for years,” said Planning and Development co-chair Rep.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The gap between Rhode Island revenue and spending appears to have closed ever-so-slightly, though the outlook for the state’s fiscal 2027 budget remains bleak.
An extra $29.2 million is expected to flow into state coffers by June 30, 2026, equal to 3.3% of the $5.8 billion in general revenue expected for the year, according to new estimates adopted by state budget analysts Monday. The conclusion to the biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference also hiked revenue projections for fiscal 2027 by $173 million, assuming the state maintains the existing hospital tax rates.
An unexpected $202 million over the next two years is hardly sofa cushion change. But it’s little reassurance for state officials already facing a $300 million deficit heading into the year that starts July 1 alongside costly consequences from federal budget cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other social programs. 
“The results of the Revenue Conference are a welcome, albeit only slightly positive, update to our budget picture,” Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement Wednesday. “Our budget is otherwise significantly impacted by federal actions that limit access to affordable healthcare and critical services for many Rhode Islanders.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson also spoke to concerns over the impact of federal policy changes, which include bigger business tax breaks expected to diminish state revenue collections next year.
“Serious budget challenges lie ahead, particularly due to the impact of federal changes to health care, SNAP, and other vital services upon which Rhode Islanders rely,” Lawson said in a statement Wednesday. 
A series of state commissioned reports unveiled in October offered a broad and dire account of the human and financial losses that federal budget cuts will create in Rhode Island, where more than one-third of the state’s annual spending plan comes from federal dollars.
But the projected financial fallout still requires more analysis, and further federal guidance. Actions by Congress could reverse some expected losses, such as the Dec. 31 expiration of federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.
Job losses and spending cutbacks amid the record government shutdown could also drag down Rhode Island’s economy well after the federal government reopens, with consequences worsening the longer the shutdown drags on, a Moody’s analyst warned state budget analysts in October. 
Lawmakers are expected to devote much of the 2027 legislative session to understanding and compensating for federal funding cuts. The annual jigsaw act commences in earnest in January, when Gov. Dan McKee unveiled his version of a state budget, based on the newly updated revenue estimates.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The $29.2 million revenue boost for the current fiscal year is driven by higher than expected personal income tax revenue, now coming in $55.5 million, or 4.4%, higher than projections from five months earlier.
Revenue from estate and real estate conveyance taxes contributed another projected $15.2 million, a 16.4% increase that potentially reflects the very early stages of an increase in the state’s real estate conveyance tax. The tax rose from $2.30 per $500 of value to $3.75 for all properties, with an extra increase on the sale of homes exceeding $800,000 (with an inflation adjustment) starting Oct. 1. 
The higher property tax revenue forecast does not account for a more controversial change to state property taxes that adds an extra tax on non-owner occupied homes over $1 million. The “Taylor Swift tax,” referred to because of its application to the pop star’s Westerly home, does not begin until July 1, 2026.
Lottery revenue also rose $10.3 million, or 4.1%, compared to prior expectations, driven primarily by video lottery and iGaming activity. In-person table gaming revenue and sports betting through Bally’s Corp’s two Rhode Island casinos slipped downward versus prior estimates.
The largest downward revision now expected in fiscal 2026 shows up in business taxes, now expected to come in at $33.4 million, or 4.7%, lower than five months ago.
Federal expansion of business tax deductions set to start in January, halfway through Rhode Island’s fiscal year, are expected to shrink state tax rolls by $79 million a year, according to state analysis. However, this could change if state lawmakers move to decouple state tax code from federal requirements, as they did for the 2025 tax year.
Tax revenue collected from financial institutions is now poised to be $9.7 million, or 51.2% less, while cigarette sales taxes are expected to drop $4.6 million, or 2.3%.
And, amid warnings of inflationary pressures and recession fears suppressing consumer spending, sales tax revenue projections have fallen 3.2%, or $581,707.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 21:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT utilities keep former regulator in sights after PURA shakeup,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/eversource-united-illuminating-marissa-gillett-lawsuit-bias/,"Eversource and UI are seeking evidence of bias by CT's former top utility regulator, Marissa Gillett, despite her departure from PURA.","Two of Connecticut’s largest utility companies are pressing forward with an effort to uncover evidence of bias by the state’s former top utility regulator, Marissa Gillett, despite her departure from government and a shakeup of the agency she once led.
That effort is playing out largely through of pair of lawsuits filed over the last year by Eversource and Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, alleging that Gillett flouted state laws and exerted near total control over rate cases during her roughly six years spent as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
The allegations raised in those lawsuits, as well as mounting pressure from lawmakers, led to Gillett’s resignation on Oct. 10. 
Since then, attorneys for PURA have conceded in court filings that many of Gillett’s actions — including her decision to appoint herself “presiding officer” over hundreds of contested matters — violated the state’s Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. 
They’ve also offered to reconsider a 2024 rate case involving two of Avangrid’s gas utilities that is at the center of one of the lawsuits.
Attorneys for the utilities say that is not enough. They are seeking access to records and permission to conduct interviews with Gillett’s former colleagues regarding her alleged bias against utility companies — including allegations that she helped author an op-ed with two state lawmakers accusing the companies of “propaganda.”
“All of these issues remain in play, and we need to get to the bottom of it,” Perry Rowthorn, an attorney representing Avangrid said during a hearing Wednesday in New Britain.
The judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, at times during Wednesday’s hearing appeared skeptical of the utility’s argument, asking more than once why he needed to “get to the bottom of it.”
The state has agreed to send the underlying rate case — PURA’s decision to deny Avangrid’s request for an increase in gas rates and instead ordering the company to lower prices — back to regulators for a new set of hearings. In those hearings, Budzik noted that PURA has agreed to implement new procedures to correct the issues raised during Gillett’s tenure.
“I’m not sure what you want me to do other than say that this process was infected by all these issues and you have to do it over again,” Budzik said. 
Neither PURA nor Gillett responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. Gillett is currently serving as a senior fellow for the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit which describes itself as part of the “anti-monopoly movement.”
A colleague’s testimony
The utilities’ claims against Gillett were further bolstered last week when one of her former colleagues, PURA Commissioner Michael Caron, gave a deposition in which he said Gillett was a self-described “control freak” who appeared to harbor a bias against utilities.
Caron also called Gillett a “talented… borderline brilliant person” whose tactics were nonetheless controversial, even within the agency.
“There’s some who find her a champion [of consumers] and there’s some who believe she’s upending the regulatory compact,” Caron said, according to a transcript of the deposition. “I found that the decisions that have come out during her tenure tended to push costs out into the future. She wasn’t really saving the ratepayers anything.”
Caron’s deposition was delivered in a joint lawsuit, filed by Eversource and Avangrid in January, in which the companies alleged that Gillett had overstepped her authority by issuing hundreds of rulings on procedural matters without approval or input from her fellow commissioners. Caron stated in his deposition that he felt sidelined by Gillett, and that the chair limited his access to staff and information about pending cases.
On Monday, Attorney General William Tong’s office filed a complaint in that case accusing the utilities’ attorneys of using Caron’s deposition as a “fishing expedition” into other topics, such as whether Gillett helped to write the controversial op-ed or whether she attempted to cover up communications with the piece’s authors through an auto-delete setting on her personal cell phone.
Tong’s office is also seeking a pause in future depositions in order to get a court ruling limiting the scope of those proceedings.
In their response filed on Wednesday, attorneys for Eversource and Avangrid argued that their questioning of Gillett’s biases and use of auto-delete was necessary to determine whether those issues were present throughout the agency, including among existing staffers.
In addition, while the companies acknowledged efforts to reform internal procedures under Gillett’s successor, Interim Chairman Thomas Wiehl, they said those changes have yet to be fully put in place.
“To understand the ongoing problems at PURA, the parties need to have a truthful, straightforward understanding of what has happened over time to distort the agency’s internal procedures and decision making protocols, including what was done to hide, reinforce, or modify those procedures to avoid public scrutiny,” the companies said in their response. 
Both Gillett and the two listed authors of the op-ed, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, and Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, have repeatedly denied that she played any role in its drafting. Attorneys for Avangrid have sought to depose both lawmakers regarding the op-ed, though the state is opposing that effort. 
Steinberg and Needleman are co-chairs of the Energy and Technology Committee, which oversees legislation dealing with utility costs and regulations. 
“Chair Gillett is gone, I would have hoped that the utilities would have moved on,” Steinberg said in an interview on Wednesday. “It would be good for everybody if these lawsuits were resolved and PURA was allowed to focus on the things that matter to the people of Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_230-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Lee Zeldin, administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, came to West Virginia on Wednesday to learn more about the Mountain State. 
But despite his position leading the agency responsible for protecting public health and the environment nationwide, his focus was more on the state’s energy and manufacturing industries.
Zeldin appeared at a roundtable Wednesday morning with Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. The event was not open to the public or the press.
In comments afterward, Capito said Zeldin was joining her to tour the Toyota manufacturing facility and the John E. Amos power plant, both in Putnam County, as well as the Nucor facility.
“[Myself and] Administrator Zeldin know that we need every single power source that we can and elongating [the lifespan of] not just our power plants, but also being able to create new power plants is going to be essential,” Capito said.
In an interview on MetroNews TalkLine earlier Wednesday, Zeldin was clear on where his interests lay during his visit.
“When you’re visiting these different businesses and industries, job creators, employees and you’re able to hear their perspective and make their perspective our perspective in decision-making, then West Virginia truly has that seat at the table at that agency,” Zeldin said.
Capito, in the same interview, said it was critical for the nation’s highest environmental agency to also be concerned with the economy.
“[The EPA] impacts every manufacturer, every coal and natural gas plant, every chemical [plant], so many jobs here,” Capito said.
The administrator — who was appointed by President Donald Trump last November and confirmed by the Senate in January — has spent his first year in office working to undo environmental protection policies enacted under former President Joe Biden.
He told MetroNews TalkLine that a decision will be released shortly regarding the repeal of a Biden-era rule regarding the operation of coal-fired power plants. 
That rule would have required coal plants with operations planned past 2039 to cut or capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032. Before the rule, there had been little oversight in the U.S. regarding carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.
While Zeldin did not specify exactly what the new, potentially repealed rule would look like, he did say the EPA would soon be “able to make the final decisions that will be a very big win, after win, after win for West Virginia.”
In comments to the press after his roundtable, he emphasized that coal will remain king in West Virginia. He did not, however, mention the very real health concerns faced by communities where coal-fired power plants continue to operate or any plans by his administration to curb those impacts. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and a significant driver of greenhouse gas emissions. 
When asked by WCHS TV’s Bob Aaron whether it was “realistic” to believe that new coal-fired power plants could be coming to West Virginia, Zeldin said he was focused on “making the economics work” to ensure coal remained a key power source.
“I have continued to see coal plants that were about to close staying open. Not only are they staying open, but now they are investing new money into their site. They are continuing to invest in capital improvements, and now, instead of closing the doors, they’re expanding their operations,” Zeldin said. “That is the direction that we want to go.”
Under Zeldin and the Trump administration, the EPA has started work to repeal dozens of policies and rules meant to keep the nation’s people — as well as its air, water and land — safer from toxins and pollution. The repeals have been touted by the agency as the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”
The proposed repeals and changes undertaken include ending the agency’s regulation on greenhouse gas emissions, which are known to exacerbate climate change and harm public health; removing limits on soot pollution from smokestacks; undoing standards for mercury and other toxic air pollution; holding up funding to replace and remove lead pipes from drinking water systems; limiting the agency’s use of independent researchers and labs.
The changes have sparked concerns among both workers at the EPA and environmental advocates, who worry about the long term effects of such rollbacks, as well as the risks of politicizing the nation’s top environmental enforcement agency.
In June, nearly 300 EPA employees signed a letter sent to Zeldin rebuking the politicization of the agency and the partisanship that had taken hold there. They said politics and money had replaced science and law as the basis for decisions made by the agency. Under Zeldin, numerous employees were suspended and fired for signing the letter.
On Wednesday, Zeldin said his agency and the Trump administration believed that economic progress — through more non-renewable energy production and manufacturing — could coincide with protecting both environmental and public health. It was necessary, though, to find a balance.
“It’s not a choice between the two,” he said. “We’re excited about doing both again.”
Zeldin, however, did not specify how that balance would be found or practiced.

(Photo by Eros Hoagland/Getty Images)The University of North Carolina System gave the state’s public universities permission in September to raise tuition up to 3% for new students who enroll in the fall of 2026.
In-state undergraduate tuition has not increased in the UNC System for nine straight years. Despite the recommendations of university staff, UNC-Chapel Hill trustees weren’t prepared to raise it in 2026, either.
During a nearly three-hour presentation Wednesday, Nate Knuffman, UNC-Chapel Hill’s vice chancellor for finance and operations, made the case for a 3% tuition increase (roughly $211/yr) in in-state undergraduate tuition for incoming students starting next year.
Knuffman also recommended a $53 fee increase per student to cover the cost of a new student recreation and wellness center. Housing costs would rise an average of 7%, or $282 to $344 more per semester for residence halls, to address the current backlog of deferred maintenance projects. And Carolina Dining Services would also see a 3.9% increase (about 53 cents more per meal) to cover increased operating expenses and inflationary food costs.
“How do we know or is there any assurance that we can have that the tuition increases that we might make here, which affects our students and their families, that those dollars won’t end up going off of our campus?” asked trustee Ritch Allison.
Allison was referring to a performance model approved by the UNC System to increase campus efficiency and student outcomes. But the model was never fully embraced nor funded by the legislature, and the individual campuses were asked to contribute toward the creation of a $30 million performance pool. For UNC-Chapel Hill, that meant returning $10.8 million to the UNC System for the performance initiative.
While some of those funds are expected to return to Chapel Hill under the system model, Allison said it was difficult to support any new tuition proposal that would put greater costs on the backs of students and families if the funds would ultimately go to another campus.
“That’s really what I have a lot of angst about,” said Allison.
Knuffman said that when UNC-CH submits its proposal to system leaders and the UNC Board of Governors for consideration, they will note that they believe strongly that the dollars need to stay at Chapel Hill.
Trustee Marty Kotis, who chairs the Budget, Finance, and Infrastructure Committee, said he was opposed to any increase in undergraduate tuition for state residents. He said they should first look at raising tuition for out-of-state undergrads and graduate students.
“Board of Governors’s tuition policy says that campuses must demonstrate that they’ve exhausted all other reasonable levers before requesting an in-state tuition increase,” reasoned Kotis.
UNC-Chapel Hill Trustee Jim Blaine voices concerns about raising tuition for in-state undergraduate students. (Screen grab: UNC-CH video stream)
Trustee Jim Blaine said he objected to raising in-state tuition because UNC-Chapel Hill simply appears to spend far too much money wastefully.
Blaine pointed to UNC-Chapel Hill’s decision to spend $1 million for an external public relations firm, while employing 100 communications professionals at the school.
“It is really inconceivable to me that we subsequently have $11.5 million give or take wrapped up in people that do comms work at this school, [yet] we need to go out and hire a DC-based comms firm to do a million dollars in PR work,” said Blaine. “If we do, we need to fire some of those 100 people and eliminate their salaries.”
Blaine clarified that he was not trying to single out any one department or individual, but he was concerned about  the external perception that the flagship university was being wasteful with its resources. He suggested that Knuffman rework his proposal to hold in-state tuition flat.
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts addresses trustees at a Nov. 12, 2025 meeting. (Screen grab: UNC-CH video stream)
With several trustees now advocating against the first tuition hike in nearly a decade, Chancellor Lee Roberts was asked to weigh in on the proposed 3% increase for in-state students.
“We think it’s a very measured, reasonable increase entirely consistent with our obligations to the North Carolina Constitution,” Roberts replied.
Robert said he was worried the university has not yet received enrollment funding from the legislature, which left town without passing a comprehensive state budget.
“I worry about a dynamic in which we’re telling the General Assembly that we need the enrollment funding very badly and they turn around and say, well, you didn’t use the tools we gave you to help yourself with a tuition increase,” said Roberts.
UNC-Chapel Hill’s full board of trustees will debate the matter further on Thursday. Any increase recommended by the trustees would need to be submitted to the UNC System office by December. The UNC Board of Governors would have the final say in the first quarter of the new year.

The Bernadette Smith for U.S. Senate committee was created on Tuesday, according to Federal Elections Commission records.
Last week, Michigan Advance reported that Smith had resigned from the party and was rumored to be gearing up for a Republican U.S. Senate primary battle against Rogers of White Lake. Although Smith had not yet filed paperwork to form her campaign committee, the Advance found that a cloned domain name of bernadettesmithforsenate.com had been registered and that the URL redirected to Smith’s existing website. The domain name was registered in late October.
Republican sources who spoke to the Advance said Smith had been saying she was running for the Senate as a Republican in the weeks leading up to her resignation from the party.

The new candidate filing confirmed the Advance’s reporting and Smith’s plans to take on Rogers.
However, she will likely have a hard time making the ballot given the amount of support that has been rallied around Rogers, and the difficulties a candidate would face trying to jump in this late in the game. Major party candidates for federal office in Michigan cannot access the ballot via a filing fee and must submit at least 15,000 valid petition signatures, up to 30,000 signatures total. Petitions must also be signed by at least 100 registered voters in each of at least half of all congressional districts in the state.
The deadline for filing those signatures is April 21, 2026. With snow already falling on Michigan, getting out now to collect that many signatures could be a feat.
Dennis Lennox, a longtime Republican political and communications consultant in Michigan, said Smith’s challenges include “all of the above.”
“She has no path to making the ballot and no path to victory,” Lennox told the Advance. “If I’m Mike Rogers, I’m not worrying about this, and I would be focused on keeping my eye on the prize. Mike Rogers has to be careful not to get distracted by Bernadette Smith and be forced into pivoting back to a primary dynamic that doesn’t exist … while the Democrats deal with their own divisive intraparty fight here.”
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel in a statement believed that the new development could open up a messy primary on the Republican side if Smith were able to make the ballot.
“Mike Rogers is a loser who underperformed Trump by over 100,000 votes in 2024 because Michiganders didn’t want an out-of-touch Floridian representing them in the U.S. Senate,” Hertel said. “Now his flailing second campaign – in which Rogers has claimed there is no inflation, mocked Michiganders facing higher costs, and nearly lost a primary straw poll to a little-known ‘Stop the Steal’ ringleader – has apparently failed to earn the confidence of Michigan Republicans.”

The disciplinary case is one of two involving an array of IV-therapy clinics or spas in central Iowa that offer intravenous delivery of products and have used advanced registered nurse practitioners as their medical directors.
The first of the two cases involves advanced registered nurse practitioner Jennifer Penisten, who is currently taking the Iowa Board of Nursing to court and seeking judicial review of her recent 90-day license suspension.
In her lawsuit, filed under the name “Jennifer Peniston,” she argues the board improperly relied on her alleged confessions to misconduct rather than citing care issues involving specific patients.
Previously undisclosed Board of Nursing records indicate the board became aware of potential issues with Penisten’s practice in August 2023 when a retired physician in Ames, Mark Guffy, contacted the Iowa Board of Pharmacy and filed a written complaint regarding a Story County business called IV Therapy Services, where Penisten served as medical director.
“On their website they promote a number of their products which are given intravenously and for which, I feel, they make fraudulent claims,” Guffy wrote. “I am quite certain that their claims regarding the benefits of their products are not only deceptive (but) frankly fraudulent.”
Guffy said Tuesday his complaint was triggered after he went to his gym and saw a large banner promoting the clinic’s hydration therapy for people with hangovers.
“The banner said something to the effect of, ‘If you’re dehydrated after a night of drinking, we offer hydration therapy,'” Guffy said. “And I thought, ‘My gosh, this is a college town and you’re promoting this? This is crazy.'”
During its investigation, the Board of Nursing focused not on the products and services that sparked Guffy’s complaint, but on the nurse-licensing issues that fall more squarely within its jurisdiction.
In 2021, the board had accused Penisten of allowing a nurse to use her prescription authority to order Botox and dermal fillers. It also accused her of failing to see the patients who received the treatments, and failing to give direction on how to administer the drugs.
To resolve that disciplinary case, Penisten had entered into a settlement with the board, agreeing to see all patients for initial assessments and to provide treatment orders that were patient-specific.
As part of its 2024 investigation of the physician’s complaint, the board ultimately concluded Penisten had continued to engage in prohibited practices. It suspended her license for 90 days, leading to her court filing seeking judicial review of the board’s actions.
IV Therapy Services offered ‘alternative care’
During a December 2023 meeting with registered nurse Lauren Pearson, who owned IV Therapy Services, a Board of Nursing investigator asked Pearson about the launch of the business.
According to the investigators’ notes of the meeting, Pearson explained that she had contacted the Iowa boards of pharmacy, nursing and medicine before opening her clinic and “each person told her that it was a new business idea and a grey area.”
According to the board, clients would schedule appointments through the IV Therapy Services website and receive a health history and consent form to fill out and return. The consent form, according to the board, included an acknowledgment by the client that the services being provided were “alternative care and not considered medical treatment.”
Upon arrival for the appointment, the client and a staff nurse would decide which “IV cocktail” recipe the patient would receive based on symptoms and the client’s own requests. The nurse would then administer the drugs through a set of standing orders and protocols approved by Penisten in her role as medical director, the board claimed.
Vivid Life Spa, Vivid IV and Vivid Mobile Solutions launched
The board records indicate that in addition to her work for IV Therapy Services, Penisten opened her own aesthetics practices, Vivid Life Spa, in November of 2021 and served as the medical director there and at a separate entity she didn’t own called Vivid IV.
The board records also show Penisten launched a separate Des Moines business called Vivid Mobile Solutions that offered what she called “mobile IV vitamin infusions.”
Vivid IV’s website, board investigators noted, promoted “complementary cancer therapy.” The website currently advertises the therapy with prices starting at $129 per treatment.
The therapy is advertised as including high doses of vitamin C, which it says “produces hydrogen peroxide which is directly toxic to the cancer cells,” plus treatment with mistletoe that “can contribute to cancer cell death.”
The newly disclosed board records show that during a February 2024 interview with a board investigator, Penisten was asked about so-called “Botox parties” that may have been staged by Vivid IV.
“I informed her that I saw where Vivid IV was also performing Botox parties,” the investigator wrote. “I asked if she saw these clients prior to the administration of the Botox. At this point, Ms. Penisten stated she hesitates to say any more. She stated I was asking about Ms. Pearson, and now I’m asking about Vivid, and she can see how it correlates, but also doesn’t want to say any more, and feels she may need an attorney.”
Penisten was first licensed in Iowa in 2006 as a registered nurse. She is also a licensed advanced practice nurse prescriber in the state of Wisconsin, as well as in Iowa.
‘Imminent danger’ alleged by Live Hydration Spa
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged the former medical director of another Ames health spa, unrelated to Penisten’s businesses, with wrongdoing.
The board accused advanced registered nurse practitioner Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill with failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and reviewing the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispending of an opioid.
The Board of Nursing has not publicly disclosed the manner in which any of those regulations were allegedly violated or indicated when or where the alleged violations took place.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the business closed in September 2024.
According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.”
The company has also alleged Thompson violated her franchise agreement with Live Hydration by opening a competing business that offered IV vitamin therapy, injections, hormone replacement therapy and Botox treatments.
Thompson denied all of the company’s allegations, and is now suing Live Hydration for breach of contract and defamation, alleging the company tried to “starve” her franchise and mount a hostile takeover of the Ames location — charges the company denies.
A trial is scheduled for Dec. 15, 2026. A hearing on Thompson’s disciplinary charges was scheduled for Oct. 10, 2025, but no board decision in the matter had been made public as of Nov. 12, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

Free.,US House expected to clear bill reopening the government after record-shattering shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-expected-clear-bill-reopening-government-after-record-shattering-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House plans to approve a stopgap spending bill Wednesday evening that will end the record-breaking 43-day government shutdown once President Donald Trump signs the legislation. Democrats are expected to oppose the package en masse, though a few centrists may vote for it, despite party leaders whipping against the measure. The House action will be the first time members, who left town while the Senate struggled to pass a stopgap spending bill and curtail the shutdown, have voted since Sept. 19.House Republican leaders need nearly all of their members to back the deal after the balance of power in the House shifted to 219-214 once Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swore in Arizona Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Two GOP lawmakers — Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz — voted against the original version of the short-term spending bill when it passed the House in September. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine voted for that bill, the only member of his party to do so.The Senate significantly reworked it into what is now a 394-page package, adding in three of the full-year government funding bills and changing the date of the stopgap measure to Jan. 30, among many other provisions. The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21. The change will give Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing that Trump “looks forward to finally ending this devastating Democrat shutdown with his signature and we hope that signing will take place later tonight.”Health care costsTrump will then turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, Leavitt said, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025. “The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said. Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.Senate floor vote pledged on ACA tax creditsDemocrats said for weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline they wouldn't provide the support needed to move the House-passed, short-term spending bill over the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster unless GOP leaders negotiated over the ACA tax credits. Speaker Johnson said those talks wouldn’t happen during a shutdown and referred to it as an end-of-year issue, though he has repeatedly declined to say if he’ll hold a floor vote on the expiring subsidies in the weeks ahead. Ramifications of the shutdown worsened the longer it went on through flight cancellations, delayed payments to U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs and no pay for federal workers, just to name a few.  Seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, concerned about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, broke with party leaders this weekend to advance the reworked spending package and then voted to approve the legislation Monday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said throughout the shutdown he was interested in a bipartisan path forward on health insurance costs after the shutdown ended, committed to hold a floor vote on a Democratic bill “no later than the second week in December.”What’s in the new billThe spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.Included are:A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January; Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House was scheduled to vote, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added. The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.Separate vote planned on senators and subpoenasBut not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out. Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post. The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022 and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between January 4 and January 7, 2021 for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. Congress will likely try to finish work on the remaining nine full-year government spending bills by the Jan. 30 deadline set in the new stopgap spending bill. Failure to broker a bipartisan deal that can pass both chambers of Congress before that deadline would lead to another government shutdown, though that would be partial and only affect the agencies included in those nine bills.",,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21. The updated measure gives Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1. Lawmakers could create a partial government shutdown if they’re unable to agree on approving the remaining appropriations bill before the new government funding deadline at the end of January.Democratic discharge petitionTrump will turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a Wednesday briefing, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025. “The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said. Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.What’s in the new billThe spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.Included are:A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January;Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House voted, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added. The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.‘Legislative self-dealing’ in Senate attackedBut not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out. Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post. The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022, and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said during floor debate the bill “contains the single most corrupt provision for legislative self-dealing that anyone in this chamber today has ever voted on.”“This provision is an affront to our taxpayers, to the rule of law, to everyone who believes that we in public office must be the servants of the people, not the masters of the people who get special legal rights and privileges and multi-million-dollar payoffs,” Raskin said. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters earlier in the day that he will “definitely” be filing a lawsuit after the new provision becomes law. “And if you think I’m going to settle this thing for a million dollars? No. I want to make it so painful no one ever does this again,” Graham said, later adding he wasn’t sure if he’d win such a case.Dissatisfaction among GOP lawmakers with that provision was on full display on social media, where Florida’s Steube responded to Speaker Johnson’s post by writing that the “Senate will never take up your ‘standalone’ bill. This is precisely why you shouldn’t let the Senate jam the House.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-12 22:56:43.537977

Bob Ferguson speaks to Andi Smith of the Ballmer Group after the announcement of a major new philanthropic donation to fund early childhood education on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Ballmer Group on Wednesday committed hundreds of millions of dollars for free preschool in Washington, a massive philanthropic contribution amid state budget cuts and federal rollbacks. 
The donation of up to $170 million per year for the next decade could fund 10,000 additional slots in the state’s Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, or ECEAP, for low-income families. The program currently has just over 14,000 slots statewide at over 460 locations.
The Ballmer Group was founded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie.
Gov. Bob Ferguson called the funding “truly transformative.”
“It’d be hard to quantify how significant that investment will be for our state,” Ferguson said at a press conference Wednesday, announcing the news at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle. 
As a condition of getting the gift, the state pledged no further budget cuts to the ECEAP program for the next 10 years.
Established in 1985, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, open to kids ages 3 and 4, is similar to the federally-supported Head Start. Washington’s program offers free early learning child care or preschool, as well as support services.
Children who participate in ECEAP are more likely to be “kindergarten ready” and less likely to need special education services, according to a 2022 Washington State Institute for Public Policy report. But as school goes on, it doesn’t necessarily correlate with better test scores or high school graduation rates. 
“We at Ballmer Group have been inspired by Washington state’s commitment to ensure that every eligible kiddo has access to high-quality early learning, and Ballmer Group’s role is simple: To help that vision move faster,” said Andi Smith, the organization’s executive director for Washington.
The exact amount the Ballmer Group will give each year will be determined by demand for additional slots and whether providers are available. It’ll likely be a years-long ramp-up to fully realize the investment.
“But we are going to be moving heaven and earth to make that happen,” Ferguson said.
The governor wants to enroll an additional 2,000 children in the program next school year. 
If the state raises ECEAP funding sometime in the next decade, the Ballmers would match that, leading to added philanthropic funding. Ferguson didn’t commit to taking that step, given the state’s ongoing budget challenges, but said, “I think we have to seize this opportunity and maximize it.”
State and federal headwinds
Facing a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall this year, state lawmakers targeted ECEAP to help fill the gap. 
They postponed expansions of the preschool program that would extend it to all qualifying low-income families and child care subsidies. They slashed about 12% of slots, totaling about 2,000, many of which were unfilled due to staffing issues. They eliminated state funding for an ECEAP program for toddlers younger than 3, affecting nearly 200 families. And they decreased funding for the state’s Complex Needs grant fund that supports providers serving children with disabilities, developmental delays and behavioral issues.
The cuts to ECEAP focused on part-day slots that might not appeal to working families, while shifting toward more full school-day slots.
In total, the budget cutbacks amounted to around $60 million.
To save money this year, state lawmakers also capped enrollment in the separate Transition to Kindergarten program.
Meanwhile, the state program’s federal counterpart has faced months of Trump administration efforts to dismantle Head Start, which serves roughly 15,000 kids in Washington. And the government shutdown threatened federal funding for programs that serve more than 3,100 Head Start students in Washington, and led to cutbacks across the country.
The Ballmers give millions every year to various causes in Washington, many of which focus on education.
In 2023, the Ballmers gave $38 million to the University of Washington for scholarships to study early childhood education. At the time, the university said the money would provide more than 1,500 scholarships over the ensuing eight years.
State lawmakers will need to pass a bill in the upcoming legislative session to formally receive the Ballmers’ latest gift.
To be eligible for ECEAP, families have to earn less than 36% of the state median income. For a family of four, that’s around $50,000 a year. It’s also available to children who are homeless or who’ve previously participated in certain birth-to-age-3 programs, and those on individualized education programs, which are for students with disabilities.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5070-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

Months after state watchdogs reported that health care spending once again blazed past the target for affordability, the Health Policy Commission convened the usual cavalcade of policymakers, analysts, providers, and insurers on Wednesday to survey the landscape and ponder steps Massachusetts can take. 
Speaker after speaker at the day-long cost trends hearing landed on a similar conclusion: The state’s long-standing health care problems will only grow more dire thanks to funding cuts and eligibility changes enacted by the Trump administration. 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell, who has repeatedly challenged the federal government in court, warned that “business as usual is not working” on the health care front. 
“It may mean we have to exercise some courage, be a little bit more bold, take a few more risks, revisit the benchmarks,” Campbell said. 
Elected officials will have their hands full charting a state response to the massive changes coming through the federal reconciliation package, a law supporters dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
About 300,000 Bay Staters are expected to lose coverage through MassHealth, the state Medicaid program, or the Massachusetts Health Connector marketplace over the next decade, according to state data cited by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation president Audrey Shelto. 
Once the myriad provisions in the law fully take effect, Massachusetts will lose about $3.5 billion annually in federal health care funding — more than a quarter of the $12.3 billion the state receives from Washington today for health care, Shelto said. 
“The state is going to have to make some really, really hard decisions. This is not a number that they can make up,” Shelto said. “Some of the decisions are going to also have to be: Who gets covered? What do they get for coverage? What do providers get paid?” 
Under the new federal law, some lawfully present immigrants — about 2,500 in Massachusetts, according to Shelto — will lose eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
Many other potential enrollees will face work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and will need to prove that they remain eligible every six months, twice as often as current policy. Shelto said those two changes together are projected to “double the rate of uninsurance in Massachusetts.” 
She stressed that impacts will bleed out to all Bay Staters, not just those who might lose heavily subsidized health insurance. If funding cuts cause providers to stop offering services or to scale back staffing, Shelto said, “it’s not going to matter if you’re receiving MassHealth as your insurance or if you have Blue Cross Blue Shield or Point32 or anyone else — that place is not going to be available to you.” 
On top of those changes, more than 300,000 residents face higher premiums starting in 2026 for insurance they get through the Health Connector because of expiring federal tax credits. 
Democrats in Congress have been pushing to extend those subsidies beyond their end-of-year sunset, making the topic a central focus during the record-breaking government shutdown, but it appears unlikely they will be able to get enough Republicans on board. 
“We may be able to turn this crisis into an opportunity,” Shelto said of the combined federal impacts. “We may be bold enough to do things that we wouldn’t go near before because they were just too hard. But the urgency and the potential devastation here is just so imperative for us to really do that.” 
Deep fissures in the state’s health care system had been apparent long before passage of the reconciliation package or agreement on a deal to reopen the government without extension of the subsidies. 
Take the assessment Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s point person on health care, delivered in March, nearly four months before Trump signed the megalaw: “We hear about a system in crisis,” she said at the time. “We’re beyond that. It is now falling apart.” 
“We’re seeing all of these issues being exacerbated by the federal administration, not just because they’re seeking to take resources away, but [also because of] the chaos and the confusion,” Campbell told reporters Wednesday. “You don’t know at times what their policy is, or you’re learning it 24 hours before it’s supposed to take effect, and then we’re in court trying to protect Massachusetts residents.” 
Total health care spending in Massachusetts grew 8.6 percent from 2022 to 2023, far above the 3.6 percent benchmark that represents the state’s cost-containment goal, driven in part by higher spending on pharmaceuticals and specialty care. 
The trend has saddled many employers and households with higher costs, too. Premiums for small businesses will increase by an average of 11.5 percent in 2026. The Center for Health Information and Analysis said in March that more than two in five Massachusetts residents struggled to afford health care in some way over the past year. 
Neil Abramson, the owner of ECi consignment stores, said the squeeze is being felt in both directions. “Businesses like ours and our employees are spending more and getting less from their health care,” he added. 
Other attendees also warned of a dire state on the front lines.  
New England Medical Association president Dr. Ellana Stinson said she’s observing more and more patients unable to afford basic medications. Liliana Patino, senior director of community impact and development for Eliot Community Human Services, said community agencies are “overwhelmed” trying to translate complex policy changes into language that people can understand. And Dr. Katherine Gergen Barnett, the vice chair of primary care innovation and transformation at Boston Medical Center, said the ability to provide high-quality care faces “grave danger.” 
Gergen Barnett called on policymakers to devote significant attention and new resources toward primary care, an area where provider burnout and comparatively low investment are making it harder for residents to get appointments. 
In 2021, only about 8 percent of all commercial health care dollars in Massachusetts went to primary care. Some policymakers are beginning to coalesce around the idea of mandating a higher share of funding for primary care, which could draw resources away from other areas. 
For her part, Gergen Barnett suggested Massachusetts direct 10 percent to 12 percent of health care dollars toward primary care. 
“This is not business as usual,” she said. “Primary care and the health of Massachusetts depend on urgent action.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_28_SNAP_rally_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Screenshot). A message by the Billings Outlaws of the Arena Football One league says the team, which won the last ArenaBowl, will go dormant for the 2026 season, placing much of the blame on the fans and the civic leaders of Montana’s “Magic City.”
Montana has no other professional indoor football teams.
The Billings Outlaws had won the ArenaBowl XXXIII championship, defeating the Albany Firebirds 46-41 on July 19, 2024, in a nationally televised game on CBS Sports Network.
The announcement said that the team will “go dormant” for a year to find its future home. An article published by KULR TV in Billings also listed a realtor as taking ownership offers.
However, the team laid the problems at the feet of fans and local politicians in a statement:
“Due to an increase in costs, the lack of any municipal or state government support, and the simple fact that even with $10 tickets in Billings, we couldn’t fill TDS Fiber Field for nationally televised games, it is apparent that the Outlaws being in Billings isn’t longer feasible for the team.”
The Outlaws compete in Arena Football One and played at the MetraPark complex in Billings. They were founded in 2022 and became the third indoor football team to call Montana’s largest city home. Another team, the Billings Outlaws, played from 2000 through 2010 there, while the Billings Wolves competed in 2015-2016.
The Billings Gazette reported in May that the ownership group, which was led by Wyoming attorney Steven Titus, was considering moving the team, which was accompanied by a decision to drop the name “Billings” from the team title.
The Billings Outlaws franchise finishes with a total of 24 wins and 10 losses. Eight teams remain in the Arena Football One, with Titus serving as its chairman. The two nearest teams are the Washington Wolfpack, located in Everett, Washington, or the Oregon Lightning, located in Redmond, Oregon.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Billings-Outlaws-homepage-1024x633.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

She also criticized national pro-redistricting groups' ""completely unacceptable"" methods.","Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, defends a farmland ownership bill in the Senate Chamber on March 4, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Longtime Indiana Sen. Jean Leising on Wednesday announced she “will vote NO” on early congressional map changes, citing constituent opposition.
“I have heard from hundreds of constituents on this matter in the past two months, and they are overwhelmingly opposed to mid-cycle congressional redistricting — with only 6% supporting new districts,” Leising, R-Oldenburg, said in a written statement.
She joins five other Senate Republicans to publicly pan plans to reconfigure congressional maps created just four years ago. Thirteen have come out in support, but more than half of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.
Indiana lawmakers will meet in December to consider creating more GOP U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Author of 2021 congressional map now on board for mid-cycle redistricting

Indiana’s current map advantages Republicans 7-2, but proponents are gunning for a 9-0 version. Boundaries are typically adjusted every 10 years using new census data.
“Washington, D.C.-funded organizations in favor of redistricting are using extremely negative texts, videos and phone calls to try to win support for their cause,” Leising said.
“Some have even been sent via cell phone to students in my district, including my 14-year-old grandson,” she continued. “These groups do not have the best interest of my rural area or the state of Indiana at heart, and their methods are completely unacceptable. I have never supported negative campaigning.”
One influential Washington, D.C. group on Wednesday began airing another round of pro-redistricting TV ads in Indiana.
Also Wednesday, an Indiana-based organization with ties to Trump’s presidential campaigns launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undeclared Republican members of the Indiana Senate. There’s more focus on that chamber because the Senate GOP’s caucus leader has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.” His counterpart in the Hosue has confirmed enough support to pass new maps.
Leising also called it “discouraging that we are being asked to vote for a map that we have never seen,” adding, “I would never vote YES on a bill that I did not know the contents of.” She hoped her constituents would understand “that we should not vote YES on completely unknown changes.”
“I will be listening to my constituents and will vote NO if there is a vote,” she concluded.
The longtime lawmaker has served in the Senate since 2008, as well as 1988-1996. She represents Decatur, Fayette, Ripley and Rush counties in southeast Indiana, along with portions of Franklin, Jennings and Shelby counties.
Leising is a retired nurse who works as a travel agent and farmer, according to her legislative biography. She lives on her farm in Oldenburg, and has three grown children and eight grandchildren.

Conservation groups say Taylor, like Asha, is probably roaming to find a mate. (Aislinn Maestas, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation groups this week criticized New Mexico wildlife officials for the recent capture and relocation of “Taylor,” a wandering male Mexican gray wolf, back to a protected zone in the Gila National Forest.
The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish caught Taylor on Nov. 7 near Gallina, a small, unincorporated community in Rio Arriba County. He was captured by helicopter and returned to the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, which includes most of the state below I-40. 
According to a statement from the Department of Game and Fish, Taylor first ventured north of the interstate in mid-July and was relocated. Such wandering away from an established pack is known as dispersal. Since late October, Taylor “has made significant movements to the north, showing no signs of returning to the” experimental population area.
“Dispersal events like this often occur when a wolf is in search of a mate,” the department stated. “As there are no other known Mexican wolves in the area, there was a potential risk of mortality as well as a likelihood of a negative interaction or breeding with domestic dogs.”
However, several conservation organizations have condemned the department’s decision to relocate Taylor for a second time to stay within government-set boundaries, which they describe as “arbitrary.” Their statement also notes that conservation groups named the wolf Taylor after Mount Taylor, where he was first encountered in May 2025. The peak is located near Grants, north of I-40. Moreover, a joint news release from several conservation groups notes, Taylor’s movements indicate he might be looking for a mate as the breeding season for the species begins in January.
“It’s ridiculous to keep moving wolves back south of Interstate 40 when wolves have clearly decided there’s great habitat to the north of the highway,” Greta Anderson, deputy director of Western Watersheds Project, said in a statement. “We fully expect that, like Asha before him, he’ll head right back to his northern territory. We can’t explain his desire, but we shouldn’t deny his instincts.” 
Asha, a female Mexican gray wolf, wandered north of I-40 in New Mexico several times. She was recently released from captivity in August to the Gila National Forest with her mate and pups. Another female gray wolf, known as Ella, was found dead in April this year soon after she was also spotted near Grants. At the time, Sally Paez, staff attorney for New Mexico Wild, told Source New Mexico that it was “exciting” to see these endangered wolves traveling into parts of the state that could offer “suitable wolf habitat” and “good wildlife corridors.”

Conservation organizations added that there have been two other wolves to wander too far north in recent years, making Taylor the fifth wolf in recent years to wander north. They also emphasized that Taylor’s wandering did not lead to any conflict with humans these last several months.
“We’ve long known that the political boundaries imposed on Mexican gray wolf recovery do not match ecological ones, and that this poses a significant hindrance to recovery,” Luke Koenig, Gila grassroots organizer for New Mexico Wild, said in a statement this week. “We have an opportunity here to advance recovery efforts by simply allowing Taylor—and other lobos—to wander north into historic and suitable habitat, and yet we expend significant resources time and time again preventing just that.”
According to the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, a nonprofit organization working to restoring wolves and ecological health in the Grand Canyon area, Mexican wolf dispersal and reintroduction into northern New Mexico and southern Colorado would contribute to the animal’s long-term recovery and provide opportunities for interbreeding and genetic diversity.
“Taylor knows where he belongs,” Claire Musser, executive director of the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, said in a statement. “Wolves like him are showing us what real recovery looks like, not confined by arbitrary lines, but led by instinct, resilience and the search for connection.If we truly care about their survival, we must let lobos lead.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ashawolf-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Board of Regents tossed around potential bylaws and metrics for measuring success of the University of Iowa’s new center for intellectual freedom during its Wednesday meeting as the center’s overseers prepare for the program’s launch.
Multiple regents suggested changes to bylaws presented to the board for the first time Wednesday by interim center director Luciano de Castro. Among the top concerns was staving off potential out-of-state control, prompted by proposed rules as to the tenure status of committee members.
Regent and advisory council chair Christine Hensley said the legislation requiring the center’s formation is “vague” in some areas.
“We, after having conversations with legal counsel and staff, determined that the best approach for the bylaws would be to keep them simple, and maybe understanding also that we would maybe miss or not address every single thing,” Hensley said. “So this is the start.”

Included in the bylaws in their current form are the center’s purpose and mission and rules for committee membership, duties, course and certification offerings and more. The center “shall educate students by means of free, open, and rigorous intellectual inquiry to seek the truth,” according to the bylaws, and it “affirms the value of intellectual diversity in higher education and aspires to enhance the intellectual diversity of the University.”
De Castro also recognized in the bylaws the center’s responsibilities to instill in students necessary mental skills and habits to “reach their own informed conclusions on matters and political importance” and to facilitate a community that respects intellectual freedom, differences of opinion and people’s individual abilities to work and grow.
The center’s advisory council will oversee the nationwide search for a director, according to the bylaws, in addition to advising the director and board of regents on topics impacting the center and overseeing center operations. No council members are eligible for the director job.
Meetings of the advisory council must occur at least once every semester, the bylaws stated, and it is bound by state open records laws.
Two committees will be formed from the council membership, split between executive and scholarly duties. A majority of executive committee members must be current or former tenured professors from an R1 research institution, according to the bylaws, and every scholar committee member must meet those criteria.
Regent Nancy Dunkel’s concerns about out-of-state control of the center lingered Wednesday, with her asking Hensley who on the advisory council would be excluded from committee appointments and how many of them are Iowans.
Regent Robert Cramer proposed striking the language in the bylaws referring to executive committee membership requirements for tenure, which Dunkel agreed with and said similar language relating to the scholar committee should also be struck.
“I’m hoping that we have, and can maintain, Iowa control,” Dunkel said.
The executive committee will manage the search for a director and handle materials and minutes for the full advisory council, as well as advise the council chair on the center and its activities. The scholar committee will advise the center director on hiring, promotion and tenure of faculty involved in the center and other academic matters.
Ad hoc committees can be created by the advisory council, according to the bylaws, or by the center director for the purpose of reviewing faculty for tenure. The director has “sole and exclusive authority” to hire support staff and faculty, from temporary or part-time to tenured professors, as well as bring in visiting teachers and speakers. He also sets “the responsibilities and compensation” for center employees.
The advisory council’s first meeting is scheduled for Nov. 18, Hensley said, and an inaugural center event is being planned for early December.
Dunkel also wanted to know how success was going to be measured at the center. Hensley indicated state lawmakers, who ordered the creation of the program, would be a key part of judging its value.
“We are required to give an annual report to the Legislature outlining what has all transpired, and to be perfectly honest, I think that annual report will be really key,” Hensley said. “And if you continue to receive state appropriations for the center, I think that would be a concurrence, if they agree with the work moving forward.”
Dunkel asked if Hensley was saying that the center making money would be a measure of success. Hensley disagreed but reiterated that they’ll measure success “based on the annual report.”
Cramer said he thinks the center’s goal is “to raise the level of civic, both knowledge and engagement, by our students, by bringing in speakers and by offering these classes, but then also with the long-term intent of … adding more debate to our campus, where people of different sides can view different opinions, and we can let the students grapple with those things.”
De Castro and others have been working hard over the past month or so, Hensley said, getting bylaws ready and contracting with a firm to conduct a market study. He has also started contacting potential speakers to visit the center and is  developing two courses to be offered in the spring semester.
“To be perfectly honest, we are way beyond what was outlined in the legislation,” Hensley said.

Both legislators are working a bill to modify funding for higher education that is tied to outcomes. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The chairs of the Alabama Legislature’s education budget committees are drafting legislation that could change the funding mechanisms for higher education.
Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee chair Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, said after a hearing on the proposal before the Joint Modernizing Higher Education Funding Committee on Wednesday that they were working on criteria for the model, aimed at linking some public funding to education outcomes.
As a model, Orr cited the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) Act, passed earlier this year, which allocates more money to K-12 schools to help educate certain classes of students, such as English Language Learners and students in poverty.

“With each institution, how can we help you, emphasis on help, improve your outcomes,” Orr said. “One that the Legislature would like to see –- and I am filling in a blank — would be jobs that the state of Alabama needs. One of them is educators or teachers, one is nurses or more qualified people in health care. We need more lab technicians, who are going to be junior colleges and not universities. What are the needs that our state has, and how can we help you with additional funds to increase your numbers for those particular outputs.”
Orr said that the model would apply to two-year colleges, regional institutions of higher education as well as universities engaged in research. The model would be tailored to each of the three categories.
Orr said that the portion of the funding that is tied to outcomes will be in addition to the total that states already receive for their operations and expenses. About 30% of the funds allocated to implement the RAISE Act, he said, were intended for higher education
The senator’s comments came after a series of presentations to members of the education budget committees on how outcomes-based funding works in other states.
Consultants with ExcelinEd, a national nonprofit founded by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican, that focuses on education policy told lawmakers Wednesday that lawmakers should tie funding to their priorities for higher education and allocate additional money for students with additional needs.
Matthew Joseph, senior policy advisor for education funding with ExcelinEd, said the model must provide sufficient funding, right outcomes and some focus on higher need students to be a success. Kentucky, he said, saw “an immediate impact” from adopting the guidelines.
“If you looked at their graduation rates in the last 10 years, what you see is their growth just stalled, it just wasn’t growing very much,” he said. “Then they fine-tuned, upgraded their outcomes-based funding, and they saw a significant boost in their graduation rates, 50% higher change from year to year, over the last five years.”
Metrics could include attainment goals or ones geared toward a particular priority of the state, such as workforce goals.
House Ways and Means Education Chair Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, kept repeating workforce development as an issue, particularly Alabama’s lower labor force participation rate.
“We just created the Department of Workforce,” he said during the meeting. “We have the lowest labor force participation rate in the country, and so we are trying to focus on connecting with the business community and the consumer to find out what our job needs to be. I believe the universities need to be part of that.”
Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement that colleges and universities must have flexibility to offer courses, “include those in the humanities and liberal arts, which are essential to developing critical thinking and civic engagement.”
“The key will be balance and ensuring that policy encourages responsiveness to workforce needs while preserving the full educational mission and integrity of Alabama’s colleges and universities,” the statement said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Arthur-Orr-Danny-Garrett-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 15:57:17.553093

Jennifer Wortz […]","GOP Reps. Brian Paquette, Jennifer Wortz, and Rachelle Smit present their bill package to re-introduce abortion reporting requirements to the House Health Policy Committee. Nov. 12, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. The House Health Policy Committee heard testimony on Wednesday on a package of bills that seeks to introduce reporting requirements for abortions that providers would have to meet. 
“These bills would bring Michigan in line with most of the other states and with the data that is currently being collected federally,” said Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy), the sponsor of one of the bills in the package. “This is a no nonsense step to protect women.”
The bills would require reporting of 19 different pieces of information for each abortion. Those include demographic information, like age and marital status, as well as information about the abortion itself, including the method of abortion, method of payment, and “whether the fetus showed evidence of life” when the abortion took place. It further requires reporting of why the abortion was sought out, as well as any complications that occurred due to the abortion. 
“In this state, we have a lot of abortions that are occurring, and this legislation is designed to give us data around these procedures, to inform us to support women in these challenging times, to try to come up with policy to decrease the amount of abortions that are happening in this state,” said Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles), whose bill establishes the reporting requirements themselves. 
The package also includes legislation to criminalize the disclosure of the personal information of those receiving abortions, introduced by Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Shelbyville). Though the information collected under these bills would not include personally identifiable information, this would prevent any of that information being disclosed. 
“It’s hard to make an informed decision too, if, as a woman,” Smit said, “you don’t have any of these measures to look at.” 
Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) seemed to express some trepidation, while asking questions of presenters from Right to Life of Michigan and other anti-abortion groups, about the amount of information that would be collected under this bill, questioning how information on marital status would be relevant to understanding risks and complications. 
“I understand the desire here, and I understand the need for informed consumers,” Tisdel said. “I don’t want to be creating policy simply because we don’t like something.”
Rebecca Mastee, a policy advocate for the Michigan Catholic Conference, responded that the bill only sought to return reporting requirements to what they were prior to changes to law that went into effect after the 2022 ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights into the Michigan Constitution. 
Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, added that the details could be used to drive public policy if certain demographic groups were overrepresented in abortion statistics. 
“It restores common sense laws, which Michigan had for over 40 years and which bring needed transparency to the abortion industry,” Marnon said. 
However, Dr. Katherine Starr, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan, stated in submitted written testimony in opposition to the bills, that together, they sought to “single out abortion care from all other kinds of health care, impose medically unnecessary administrative burdens, and force providers to interrogate patients so they can deliver deeply personal and highly sensitive patient information to the state.”
Michigan had previously published reports annually with detailed statistics on abortions, including demographic data and information on complications, but those ceased after a 2023 law change. 
45 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have some kind of reporting requirement, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The requirements in these bills would be among the most detailed, with just seven states requiring data on method of payment and 10 states requiring information on the viability of the fetus. 
“Any vote against these bills is a vote against women’s safety,” said Ariane Fisher, the director of community outreach for a Catholic pregnancy resource center in Southfield, Mich.  
In contrast, Starr noted that many patients are already fearful about protecting their privacy, which could impact their care.
“Being asked to disclose where they live, their age, their marital status, and why they are seeking care, knowing that this information will be shared with the state, could further deter people from seeking care and insert more fear into what may already be a very difficult situation,” Starr said.

Patrick Morrisey has established a committee that will oversee putting a statue of West Virginia World War II hero Woody Williams at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. 
Morrisey established the Hershel “Woody” Williams Statue Commission Tuesday by executive order. 
The Williams’ statue will replace a statue of John E. Kenna in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol. Kenna was a Confederate soldier, Kanawha County prosecutor and circuit judge and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. His statue has been at the Capitol since 1901. 
State lawmakers passed a resolution during a special legislative session in October 2024 that the state should replace the Kenna statue with one of Williams. According to the resolution, Kenna’s statue will be moved to the state Culture Center for display.
Williams, of Marion County, was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroic acts as a Marine in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II and was the nation’s last surviving medal of honor recipient from World War II.
Williams also established the Gold Star Families Memorial Monument program, which honors the families of fallen service members. He died in 2022. 
According to Morrisey’s executive order, the commission will consist of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby, the deputy tourism secretary, and the following officials or their designees: the governor, the secretary of Veteran’s Assistance, Senate President Randy Smith, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, minority leaders of the House and Senate, the director of the state purchasing division and 12 members of the public that Morrisey will appoint. 
Funding for the design and creation of the statue will come from the Governor’s Contingency Fund, according to the resolution. 
The executive order does not include a timeline for appointing the remaining members of the public or of placing the statue.

At least 36 states have crafted subsidies specifically for data center projects, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group that tracks economic development incentives. But only 11 of those states — Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — disclose which companies receive those incentives.
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

In a new study, the organization examined a lack of transparency in data center deals, which are proliferating across the country as technology demands increase.  
Despite data centers’ significant energy requirements, states frequently compete heavily to land the projects, which invest millions or even billions into new construction. But the study noted those projects often employ nondisclosure agreements, project code names and subsidiary names that hide the firms behind the new server farms.
“Only when governments disclose information on which companies get public money and what they do with it can there be meaningful analysis, greater public participation, and wiser use of public financial resources,” the report says.
Good Jobs First specifically examined sales and use tax exemptions that benefit data centers. The study does not account for local property tax abatements, corporate income tax credits and discounts on electricity and water rates.
Virginia, the largest data center market in the world, forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue each year without telling the public which companies benefit or how much they receive, the study said.
Good Jobs First underscored state calculations that show data center subsidies do not provide a return on taxpayer investments. It recommends states eliminate or curtail data center subsidies. “At the very least, states should practice full transparency,” the report said.
Good Jobs First says states must reassess their investments in data centers with federal cuts looming that will strain state finances.

Montana inmates were again experiencing problems with water this week.
This time, though, it wasn’t in Deer Lodge and the solution didn’t take weeks.
Family members and inmates reported on Tuesday morning the hot water in a private prison in Mississippi had been out, with no communication on how long it would last.
Core Civic, the private-prison operator which contracts with the State of Montana and runs facilities in several locations, says that hot water has been restored to its Tutwiler, Mississippi facility after just 24 hours. The State of Montana contracts with Core Civic to house male inmates at the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility.
This isn’t the first water issue for MT inmates this fall. For several weeks in October, crews worked around the clock and the Montana National Guard was called in to help solve water supply issues to the Department of Correction’s largest facility, the Montana State Prison, in Deer Lodge. Those problems have recently been resolved and water there has been flowing normally and has been tested as safe, according to Montana Department of Corrections Officials.  
A spokesperson for the company said the problem was reported, addressed and corrected all within a day. Ryan Gustin, Senior Director for Public Affairs released this statement after the Daily Montanan inquired about the situation:


“The safety, health and well-being of those in our care and the staff at all our facilities, including Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility (TCCF), is our top priority. Earlier today, TCCF facility staff were made aware of an issue related to a lack of hot water, which was affecting several housing units. The maintenance staff at TCCF quickly isolated an issue with one of the facility boilers. They were able to address this issue within a short period of time and all hot water to the facility has been restored. At no point did the issue with the boiler impact the facility heat. It’s important to note that at all our facilities, including TCCF, we have contingency plans in place to address issues such as this if the repair were to take longer than expected.
“TCCF staff conduct inspections on all housing units, at least once per shift, to monitor for any maintenance-related issues. If any issue related to the physical plant is observed, a maintenance work order is generated immediately. Maintenance work orders are typically resolved within 24 hours, as was the case here.”
 
Officials with the Montana Department of Corrections confirmed the situation on Wednesday and said they’re also monitoring the situation in Mississippi.
As of Wednesday, the department’s dashboard showed 239 inmates from Montana housed at that facility. Montana can send a maximum of 240 inmates there. Currently, Montana has 3,356 inmates housed throughout its different facilities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tallahatchie-front-entrance-1024x985.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 15:57:17.553093

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.



The No Kings protests in October, which drew over seven million people across the country, were hailed as the largest demonstrations in American history. Now the question for many people is: What works to stop authoritarianism?
Maria Stephan has been studying this question. Her award-winning book, “Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict,” co-authored with Erica Chenoweth of Harvard, examines a century of resistance movements around the world. They determined that nonviolent protests are more than twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts. Chenoweth went on to coin the widely cited 3.5% Rule, which states that when 3.5% of the population protest nonviolently, the movement will win. 
“When you have 3.5% of a population, which in the United States is roughly 12 million people, that means a movement is representative. It’s hard to ignore. It’s highly disruptive. And behind those 3.5% are many, many more people who support the aims of the movement,” Stephan told The Vermont Conversation.
Maria Stephan was a strategic planner with the U.S. Department of State and founded and directed the Program on Nonviolent Action at the U.S. Institute of Peace. She is the author and editor of five books on authoritarianism and civil resistance. She was born and raised in Vermont and currently lives in New York City, where she is chief organizer with the Horizons Project, which she describes as “building a strong pro-democracy front that brings people together from different parts of society to effectively counter authoritarianism in the U.S.” 
Stephan highlighted the many tactics of the movement against authoritarianism. “We know from studying nonviolent resistance campaigns against authoritarian regimes around the world that it’s the organized acts of non-cooperation — when people withhold their consumer buying power, when workers withhold labor, when security forces refuse to use repression vis a vis peaceful protesters — these acts of non-cooperation are what is really key to the success of pro-democracy movements, and we’re seeing this across the country.”
She cited examples of “people taking courageous stands both as individuals and collectively.” These include “the powerful image of the Idaho teacher, Sarah Inama, who refused to take down the sign ‘Everyone is Welcome Here’ in her classroom, which resulted in the whole community mobilizing in support of inclusive classrooms.”
There was Rachel Cohen, “the young lawyer who left her law firm after it capitulated to Trump. She not only left the firm, she organized thousands of lawyers to similarly commit to not be part of firms that engage in that type of capitulation.” 
Stephan said that in the higher education sector, “seven out of nine universities have refused a higher education compact offered by the Trump administration that would have offered access to federal funding in exchange for various forms of censorship on campus.” And the World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers, she said, refused ICE agents access to their grounds to coordinate arrests of immigrants and undocumented people.
“For all these reasons and all the powerful, joyful, creative acts of defiance and community care I’m seeing across the country. I believe we will prevail.”

Vendors had 72 hours following the Nov. 3 announcement to notify the state of their intent to challenge the decision.The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis has announced its intent to award a multibillion-dollar Medicaid managed-care contract for medically complex children to Molina Healthcare of Florida.
The decision, announced earlier this month, is not final and can be challenged. Vendors had 72 hours following the Nov. 3 announcement to notify the state of their intent to challenge the decision. 
Thereafter, statutes provide vendors an additional 10 days to file formal written protests with the state.
The Agency for Health Care Administration did not immediately say whether it had received any protest notices.
But Sunshine Health, the wholly owned subsidiary of Centene Health, won’t be challenging “at this time” and attributed the decision to “concerns related to terms contained in the final version of the state’s [invitation to negotiate] that we were not able to agree to.”
The company did not elaborate on what those concerns were.
 “Having served this program statewide, we have a deep understanding of the level of service and care the children who rely on this program need,” the statement read. “In evaluating the state’s proposed terms, our understanding of this population informed our consideration of multiple key factors, including whether the terms align with our mission of transforming the communities we serve, are sustainable for us as an organization, and will ultimately enable Sunshine to provide our members the quality care they deserve.”

Centene is the health care company that negotiated a Medicaid settlement with the state that resulted in $10 million being sent to the nonprofit foundation associated with Hope Florida, an initiative pushed by First Lady Casey DeSantis designed to help people move off of government assistance programs.
Health care giant Centene writes a $10M check to Hope Florida Foundation

The Hope Florida Foundation wound up sending millions to two groups that then steered money to an effort to defeat a ballot proposal on marijuana. The arrangement triggered a probe by the Florida House and has led to a grand jury investigation, according to several published reports. Centene has said previously that the Agency for Health Care Administration directed the terms of the settlement.
The ITN vendors were asked to bid on does contain a section on Hope Florida and a requirement that the winning health plan coordinate with the program to help “graduate” people from Medicaid and Florida KidCare. 
Rising enrollment, payments
The CMS managed-care plan is for medically complex children living in lower income households, whether they qualify for Medicaid or Florida KidCare, the state’s version of the children’s health insurance program. Children enrolled in KidCare pay monthly premiums for the coverage whereas Medicaid-eligible children don’t.
The new contract will expire Dec. 31, 2030, and cannot be renewed but can be extended if necessary to cover any delays during the transition to a new contract. There is no guaranteed payment; the contract notes payment is “contingent upon availability of funds.” 
But a review of Medicaid data shows state economists anticipate increases in the number of medically complex children enrolling in the managed-care network and hikes in the payments to the health plan for treating the children.
Florida’s top economists predict enrollment in the plan will climb from an anticipated 113,171 children this year to 120,277 by June 2030. The state’s monthly managed-care payments are expected to increase from about $4,555 per member per month to more than $5,400 per member per month by June 30, 2030.
Molina Healthcare of Florida is under contract for another Medicaid managed-care program to provide health care services in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. While the CMS managed-care program caters to medically complex children, the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program provides services to a more traditional Medicaid population.

The completion last month of the two-year-long, $31.6 million cleanup effort at the USS Yorktown averts the potential of the aging battleship-turned-maritime-museum springing a toxic leak.
“The USS Yorktown was a ticking environmental time bomb, with the risk of disaster increasing each year, and now it has been safely and successfully defused,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement Wednesday celebrating the project’s success.

“Had these materials leaked, they would have caused catastrophic damage to Charleston Harbor, destroying marshes and estuaries, killing marine life, and threatening industries that support thousands of jobs across the Lowcountry,” McMaster added. “Instead, we took action to prevent that disaster and protect South Carolina.”
The USS Yorktown came to South Carolina in 1975. The ship, built in 1943 to replace the original Yorktown sunk by a Japanese submarine in the Battle of Midway, saw tours in both World War II and the Vietnam War. At its peak, 3,300 sailors manned the 820-foot vessel, which is now a national historic landmark that welcomes some 300,000 visitors annually.
When the United States military decommissioned and gifted the ship to the Palmetto State, however, it did so on an as-is basis.
The fuel and oil that had once kept the ship running remained on board for decades. After nearly 50 years mired in pluff mud, the ship’s outer hull began to corrode, posing a serious risk to the state’s pristine beaches and $29 million tourism industry.
Using federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds, the state brought in contractors in the fall of 2023 who pumped out nearly 600,000 gallons of oily water and 9 tons of sludge from a portion of the ship’s 428 liquid storage tanks and removed 4.5 tons of asbestos. Divers also patched 35 holes in the ship’s hull.
Then, in a second phase that began in February, workers from HEPACO LLC, Shipwright, Inc., and Isla Maritime pulled out the remaining 1.4 million gallons of fuel and oil, as well as 9 tons of asbestos insulation.
Crews added back freshwater to the now clean tanks to ensure the Yorktown remains stable.
The former warship has become the crown jewel of the state-owned Patriot’s Point Naval and Maritime Museum visited by 300,000 tourists each year.
“I am proud of this team for identifying the need to act and working efficiently to mitigate the possibility of contamination, while preserving a significant historical landmark in our state,” Ben Duncan, who leads the state Office of Resilience, said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/USS-Yorktown-Photo-1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 15:57:17.553093

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey NAACP and two Latino groups sued state insurance regulators Wednesday, alleging they improperly allowed insurers to use proxies for income and race when setting car insurance rates.
In their suit, the NAACP, Latino Action Network, and Latino Coalition of New Jersey argue that the use of income proxies like education and occupation allows insurers to skirt restrictions and raise rates for low-income and Black or Latino drivers, regardless of their actual risk.
“A person’s degree or job title should not determine what they pay to drive. These so-called risk factors are thinly veiled discrimination that keeps communities at a disadvantage,” state NAACP President Richard Smith said in a statement.
Consumer advocacy groups have long sought to outlaw the use of income proxies in car insurance rate setting, though they’ve found little success nearly two decades into the fight.
Those groups argue factors like education and occupation raise insurance rates for good drivers who are low income, and investigations have shown car insurance rates are higher in neighborhoods with majority non-white populations, even when accident costs are similar.
The suit charges that by allowing insurers to consider occupation and education in rate-setting, regulators violated state anti-discrimination protections, constitutional equal protection guarantees, and state law barring discrimination in insurance rates.
They asked a judge to declare the use of income proxies in insurance rate setting unconstitutional.
“After decades of meetings and appeals without meaningful change, the courts are now the only path to accountability. This case challenges a system that punishes people for who they are instead of how they drive,” said Alex Shalom, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
New Jersey’s insurance regulators have long denied that the use of education and occupation data systematically boosts rates for residents with lower educational or occupational attainment, arguing those factors are simply among the many used to set rates.
In a 2008 report on the use of occupational and educational factors in car insurance, the state Department of Banking and Insurance found they had not pushed overall premiums higher for such consumers.
The report says rates proffered by Geico, which was then pioneering the practice in New Jersey, were often lower than rates of competing insurers who did not weigh a driver’s occupation or education.
Higher accident and moving violation rates in dense urban areas, where Black and Latino New Jerseyans are likelier to live and where incomes tend to be lower, could explain part of the difference, according to the report.
Research from Consumer Reports Digital Lab found lower-ranked, lower-educated New Jersey workers typically paid more for car insurance than higher-ranked, higher-educated counterparts, though the trend did not always hold true.
Not all New Jersey car insurers inquire about a prospective customer’s job or education levels.
At least five states — California, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New York — bar the use of educational and job attainment in car insurance rate setting.
New Jersey lawmakers have weighed outlawing the use of proxies like occupation and education, but those efforts have been hard fought and ended with the law unchanged.
In 2021, the Senate narrowly approved legislation that would have barred car insurers from using a customer’s profession, education level, marital status, and credit score, among some other factors, in rate setting, but the bill did not advance in the Assembly.
Successor bills reintroduced in more recent legislative sessions have not moved at all.

(Official legislative photo)The entrance of another Democrat in the race for Maine’s 1st Congressional District has teed up a primary for incumbent U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who is seeking her 10th term.
State Rep. Tiffany Roberts of South Berwick announced last week her plan to run for Maine’s southern district in the November 2026 election. She is the only Democrat currently challenging Pingree, who is seeking her 10th term in the office. The two will face off in a June 9 primary election to determine who will be on the November ballot.
Roberts’ entrance into the race came ahead of a shake-up in the Republican primary, with Sanford Police Chief Eric Small announcing his decision to conclude his run. Instead, he plans on running for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives because he feels he could be more effective in state office. In his announcement, Small backed Republican Ron Russell in his bid to unseat Pingree. 
Russell won the Republican primary for the 2024 election, but ultimately lost to Pingree by 57% to 35%. Federal election records also list Republicans Joshua Duprey and Anthony Piantidosi as candidates.  
At her launch event at the South Berwick Town Hall, Roberts talked about being elected to the Maine House seven years ago, saying she didn’t know at the time what she was getting herself into, but felt people deserved someone who would listen and fight for them. 
“In Maine, showing up still means something,” Roberts said. “It’s how trust is built, how problems get solved, and how progress starts. But let’s be honest. For far too long, government hasn’t been listening. We are tired of being talked at. Tired of promises that sound good but don’t change anything back home.”
Roberts also discussed her grown children who no longer live in the state, though “not for lack of me trying.” Because she doesn’t want other parents to see their children leave to make a decent income, she’s driven to come up with ideas for how to make Maine a place where the next generation can afford to live. 
She said her work chairing the Legislature’s Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business Committee showed her that Maine’s heritage industries need upgrading, while new technologies and markets need to be explored to create jobs for young people.
“This isn’t a campaign against anyone,” Roberts said. “It’s a campaign for something. For Maine’s future. For the next generation. For a government that listens first and acts second. Because the postcard platforms and clickbait talking points have gotten us here — where our kids are leaving, families are priced out, seniors are struggling, and small businesses are tangled in red tape. This campaign is for changing that.”
Roberts said that following the launch event she’d be starting a “Six Counties in Six Weeks” tour, during which she’ll spend a week in each county of the 1st District. She plans to hold town halls, walk shop floors and meet with voters and is asking for volunteers to help with her campaign as well as donations for staffing, field offices and other outreach. 
Roberts didn’t respond to an interview request Wednesday from Maine Morning Star.

Special Legislative Session Set for November 13 to Address State Revenue Concerns and Consider Separation Bill
Delaware Faces Significant Budget Gap as Lawmakers Reconvene
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE
DOVER, Del. — Delaware legislators are scheduled to convene in a special session on November 13, 2025, to address a projected $400 million budget shortfall. The deficit, recently forecasted by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (DEFAC), is largely attributed to federal tax changes passed under President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” As the state grapples with potential cuts to essential services, lawmakers are considering urgent measures, including a proposed separation bill that would decouple Delaware’s corporate tax code from recent federal reforms.
Background: Revenue Forecast and Federal Tax Changes
According to DEFAC, state revenues are expected to fall short by approximately $400 million for the upcoming fiscal year. The council cites the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” enacted earlier this year, as a primary factor. The legislation introduced sweeping tax breaks for corporations and high-income individuals, altering federal deductions, exemptions, and taxation structures. Because Delaware’s tax code is partially linked to federal standards, these changes have an immediate and significant impact on state revenue collection.
Impact: Essential State Services at Risk
The anticipated shortfall raises concerns about funding for critical state services. Education budgets, infrastructure improvements, and health care programs could all face reductions if new revenue sources or policy adjustments are not implemented. School districts warn that cuts could lead to larger class sizes and deferred maintenance, while health care advocates fear reduced access to programs serving vulnerable populations. Infrastructure projects, including road and bridge repairs, may also be delayed or scaled back.

Legislative Response: Urgency and Bipartisan Debate
State lawmakers from both parties have expressed a shared sense of urgency ahead of the special session. “This is not just a financial issue; it’s a matter of protecting the services Delawareans rely on every day,” stated House Majority Leader Kerri Evelyn Harris. The rapid timeline for addressing the budget gap reflects widespread concern about the ability to fund core government operations in the coming year.
Bill Details: Separation Bill Proposal
At issue are two provisions of the complex law that pertain to tax breaks for large businesses, specifically those related to research and development expenses and equipment investments. The new provisions gave business owners greater flexibility in claiming deductions for these expenses and made these favorable terms retroactive to 2022.
In response to the federal tax act’s impact, Rep. Harris is leading the introduction of a “separation bill,” formally known as the Delaware Corporate Tax Independence Act. The measure aims to decouple the state’s corporate tax code from recent federal changes, restoring Delaware’s authority to set its own definitions for corporate income, deductions, and exemptions. Proponents argue that this move would help stabilize state revenue and protect funding for essential services, while maintaining Delaware’s competitive business environment.
Stakeholder Perspectives: Diverse Reactions from Lawmakers and Advocates
Rep. Daniel Short (R-RD39) image from Delaware Legislature website.
Supporters of the separation bill, primarily among Democratic lawmakers, emphasize the need to preserve the state’s fiscal health and prevent cuts to education and health care. “We cannot allow federal decisions to undermine our ability to govern responsibly at the state level,” said Rep. Harris.
The Delaware BioScience Association (Delaware Bio), a group dedicated to advancing bioscience innovation in Delaware, noted in a recent post that the OBBBA “once again allows companies to deduct their domestic R&D costs upfront instead of stretching it out over five years.” Proponents of the change maintain that it provides both predictability and a boost to advanced manufacturing and rising start-ups in the biotech sector, enterprises that many Delaware officials believe will be key to delivering future quality jobs and new sources of state and local revenue.
Delaware State Chamber of Commerce tax expert Marie Holliday was quoted in the same piece saying that the legislation was an investment in the long-term growth of critical emerging industries. “I believe this is a win for our state,” she said.
State Rep. Danny Short, R-Seaford, a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, questioned the governor’s skewed sense of urgency.
“Early this year, the Meyer administration presented the JFC with projections showing slowing state revenue growth and significantly higher outlays outpacing that growth,” he said. “In fact, it predicted that spending would increase by 5% in each of the next two fiscal years, that we would entirely burn through our $469 million reserve budget smoothing fund, and would face a budget deficit of nearly $408 million by FY 2028. That’s an amount nearly identical to what the governor cited in calling us back into session! Somehow, that wasn’t a priority, but this is?”
Analysis from the Caesar Rodney Institute
Charlie Copeland (CRI) image from caesarrodney.org.afsaf
Charlie Copeland, president of the Caesar Rodney Institute (CRI), offers a different perspective, urging that Delaware’s budget woes are rooted more in longstanding state-level spending decisions than in federal tax law changes. Pointing to years of CRI research, Copeland highlights that the state’s fiscal challenges are the result of persistent spending growth—a pattern evident long before the most recent federal tax reforms.
“Federal tax changes may have accelerated our budget problems, but as we’ve noted at CRI for years, this is a Delaware-made problem,” Copeland writes. He notes that for six consecutive years, lawmakers have approved supplemental “off-budget” spending bills, adding more than $915 million outside the regular budget process, which has increased overall state spending beyond what is officially reported. For instance, the Fiscal Year 2024 budget included a $5.6 billion general fund, plus a $195 million one-time supplemental bill, resulting in a 13.2% spending increase—more than twice the rate of inflation.
Copeland argues that Delaware’s recent budget surpluses, often described by state officials as proof of prudent management, were actually the product of one-time federal COVID-19 relief funds from both the Trump and Biden administrations. When that aid ended, the state’s familiar boom-and-bust cycle returned: new governors inherit deficits, raise taxes, increase spending, and repeat the cycle.
The core problem, according to CRI, is that Delaware’s spending is growing at an unsustainable pace—projected at about 6.9% per year through 2027, while revenues are expected to grow just 2% annually. By that time, state spending is forecasted to outpace revenue growth by more than threefold, potentially deepening future deficits.
Beyond spending, Copeland points to Delaware’s broader economic challenges: slow growth, an aging population, and the loss of young workers and high earners. Delaware’s economy has consistently lagged the national average, and the state now has one of the lowest shares of young adults and is among the nation’s oldest by median age. These trends limit economic growth and put further strain on the tax base, especially as the costs of health care and social services rise with an older population.
Next Steps: Upcoming Vote and Possible Outcomes
The separation bill is expected to receive a committee hearing on November 13, with a floor vote anticipated soon thereafter. If passed, the legislation would take effect in the next fiscal year, allowing Delaware to set its own corporate tax policies independent of federal changes. If the measure fails, lawmakers may need to consider alternative budget cuts or revenue-raising options to close the gap ahead of the next budget cycle.
Conclusion: High Stakes for Delaware’s Fiscal Future
As Delaware lawmakers prepare to debate the separation bill, the outcome will have significant implications for state finances and essential public services. Residents, educators, health care providers, and business leaders alike are watching closely to see how the General Assembly addresses the shortfall—and whether Delaware will chart its own course in corporate taxation and spending reform. The special session promises to be a pivotal moment in the state’s ongoing efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with the needs of its citizens.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FB_IMG_1631792563094-002-1.jpg,,,2025-11-12 14:57:36.038987

In a gruesome murder that shocked the state in 2024 and culminated in a frantic weeklong search in Gallatin County, a jury has convicted Darren Christopher Abbey of deliberate homicide as he killed Dustin Kjersem, whose body was found at a campsite near Big Sky.
During the time before Abbey was apprehended, authorities told the public not to camp in the area after concerns about the killer still being on the loose in the heavily forested area, which is also hosts a huge resort.
The original crime scene indicated extreme violence such that originally it was called in as a suspected bear attack. However, when authorities arrived and began their investigation they quickly concluded Kjersem’s death was the result of a violent struggle, not due to an animal.
During the weeklong court case, the Gallatin County Attorney’s office presented evidence that showed Abbey met Kjersem while camping in October 2024. The two reportedly shared drinks in Kjersem’s tent before Abbey attacked him, striking him multiple times with a block of wood, an axe, and stabbing him with a screwdriver.
Authorities also said that Abbey later admitted to taking Kjersem’s firearms, cooler, cell phones and other belongings. Prosecutors say he returned the next day to conceal evidence. Law enforcement found no signs of an animal attack.
A Montana State Crime Lab revealed DNA evidence of Abbey on a beer can inside the tent, linking him to the scene.
Abbey will remain in custody until the sentencing on the case, which is scheduled for 1:30 p.m., on Dec. 30, before Gallatin County District Court Judge Peter Ohman.
“This verdict reflects our community’s expectation that violent acts results from the loss of life will be met with accountability,” said Gallatin County District Attorney Audrey Cromwell. “We are grateful to the jury for their thoughtful consideration of the evidence and to the law enforcement officers whose thorough investigation made this conviction possible. My heart goes out to the victim’s family, who have shown great strength and dignity throughout this process.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LJ-aerial-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-11-12 14:57:36.038987

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Unionized health care workers at Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital have not held back in criticizing private and public leaders for poor management of the hospitals.
Initial frustration took aim at the hospital’s now-bankrupt owner Prospect Medical Holdings and the former majority stakeholder, Leonard Green, which sapped the hospitals’ balance sheets to boost executive salaries and payouts to shareholders. Then, it was The Centurion Foundation, the nonprofit prospective buyer, which faced union concern for its lack of hospital experience and seemingly shaky financial plan.
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals has now shifted its ire to Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, who it accuses of “unlawfully interfering” in the sale of the Providence and North Providence hospitals.
Several dozen union members gathered outside Fatima Hospital in North Providence Tuesday afternoon, bundled in hats and coats amid freezing wind chills, to publicly condemn Charest for courting an alternative buyer when the state had already approved a sale to Centurion. 
Recent filings in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas revealed that Charest, who formerly worked as CEO and president of Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, began courting Landmark’s owner, Prime Healthcare, to see if the company was interested in acquiring Roger Williams and Fatima. 
The timeline of Charest’s interactions remains fuzzy. Gov. Dan McKee’s office said Charest reached out in September or October, while Attorney General Peter Neronha indicated he was aware of Prime’s interest well before that.
But either way, Charest’s outreach began after the June 2024 state regulatory decision granting Centurion conditional approval to buy the hospitals
“There’s something fundamentally wrong with that,” Chris Callaci, the union’s general counsel, said at the rally Tuesday. “Secretary Charest is supposed to be representing the interests of Rhode Islanders, not carrying Prime’s water. We should be seeing the Centurion deal to the finish line, not undermining it in favor of Prime Healthcare.”
Callaci warned that Charest, and by extension McKee, exposed the state to “significant legal jeopardy.”

– Chis Callaci, general counsel for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals


In a follow-up interview Tuesday night, Callaci alleged that Charest’s actions breached state contract and business law, grounds for what is known as a claim of tortious interference in business relationships. 
Kerri White, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, referred requests for comment to McKee’s office. 
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, defended the administration’s actions in a statement Tuesday afternoon but did not specifically address allegations against Charest. 
“The McKee Administration’s focus is ensuring that both hospitals remain open — providing vital care to Rhode Islanders and supporting the dedicated employees who make that care possible,” DaRocha said. “We want to see a buyer, whether Centurion, Prime, or another party, complete a deal that keeps the hospitals operating.”
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024 and Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Closing either or both facilities would have catastrophic consequences for patients, workers and the entire state health care system.
DaRocha also said the state is developing a “plan B” if the sale to Centurion does not move forward, but did not provide any details.

On the brink
The looming threat of closure solidified in October, when Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, indicated it wanted to close the facilities by Dec. 31. The company in court filings explained that it could not keep covering the operating losses for the facilities, expressing doubt that the delayed sale to Centurion would ever close.
Centurion has struggled to lure investors to back the $150 million in bonds needed to meet the financial terms the state tied to the approval of the deal, despite multiple revisions that reduced the upfront cash requirements. Negotiations approved by a federal bankruptcy judge on Friday ensure the hospitals have enough funding to stay open through the end of the month, but their future remains in jeopardy if Centurion can’t close the deal.
Enter Prime Healthcare, a California for-profit that has made a name for itself buying hospitals in bankruptcy nationwide, including Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical in 2013.
Charest, who led Landmark under Prime until 2017, touted the company’s record in a statement supplied via Prime’s spokesperson. 
“We have reached out to Prime Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit public charity, because of their unique ability to save and improve hospitals in times of crisis nationally and ensure award-winning quality, equity, and access for communities,” Charest said. “Time and time again they have saved hospitals even amidst the greatest challenges and have the national scale, leadership, clinical quality, and dedication to charitable care that can ensure these hospitals continue their missions.”
The praise leaves out Prime’s history of Medicare and billing fraud and illegal federal kickback schemes, which resulted in three separate settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice totaling more than $100 million from 2018 to 2021. The California company is the only medical facility to have settled this many federal cases in recent history, according to a 2023 Reuters investigation of medical settlements. 
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, said in an emailed response Tuesday that the settlements resulted in no finding of fault or liability by the company.
“The exceptional care and quality for which Prime Healthcare is recognized were never questioned; the matters were concluded successfully, with independent audit verification showing performance better than peers,” True said.
Callaci still has doubts.
“I do not believe for a second that those three settlements with the DOJ are just garden variety settlements,” Callaci said in an interview Tuesday night. 
Since taking over Landmark in Woonsocket in 2013, UNAP’s 500 hospital workers at the hospital have had to fight against the company for competitive pay and benefits, said Lynn Blais, union president.
“They are definitely not your best corporate partner when it comes to worker relationships,” Blais said in an interview Tuesday.

Profits over people  
Part of Prime’s model relies on cost-cutting measures, including workers and services. A few months after buying eight Illinois hospitals this spring, Prime laid off 100 workers, while suspending pediatric services at one of the hospitals, ending obstetric and maternal care at another, and withdrawing a trauma designation at a third.The service cuts drew criticism from U.S. Sens. Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Illinois Democrats, who urged the company to reconsider in a May 20 letter.
“Hospitals often measure their success by the patients they save and the ability to improve health in their surrounding neighborhoods,” Durbin and Duckworth wrote. “However, as the grip of for-profit hospital systems tightens across our nation’s health care networks, profitability has risen as a primary indicator of success for hospital owners. When operations are centered around a hospital’s ability to generate as much profit as possible, it often comes at the expense of patients, staff, and the quality and safety of care.”
It’s a reality patients and workers at Fatima and Roger Williams endured for the last decade under Leonard Green and Prospect. As recently as late 2023, Prospect failed to pay its vendors on time, leading to equipment and medical supply shortages and canceled procedures, according to court documents. Critical infrastructure repairs have not been performed, prompting citations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which warned in April 2024 that the hospitals remained in “substantial noncompliance” for basic safety standards.
True sought to distinguish Prime’s for-profit arm from its separate charitable foundation. The latter would be potentially buying Rhode Island hospitals, True said.
Anxiety seeps through the walls and exam rooms at Fatima, where Blais works as a nurse. 
“They’re frustrated, they’re afraid but most of the people there are so committed to the organization and to the patients,” she said of the 2,400 workers across both facilities. “They just want to know their job is secure and that the hospitals are secure.”
Who offers that security — Centurion, Prime, or someone else — is unimportant to most workers, Blais said. But she shares Callaci’s concerns with Prime, and with Charest’s role.
“He worked for them, he retired with the promise of a retirement package from them,” she said of Charest. “To come in, under the guise of a cabinet member for the governor, it doesn’t smell right.”
But a bad smell doesn’t necessarily constitute illegality.
The letter of the law 
Rhode Island’s contract laws allow for claims of tortious interference in business relationships, as Callaci suggested, but only when certain conditions are met. Most importantly, there has to be a contract already finalized, said Robert Flanders Jr., a partner at Whelan Corrente & Flanders LLP and former Rhode Island Supreme Court justice. 
Centurion has yet to meet the state-imposed financial requirements tied to the sale, so the terms of its contract appear unfinalized, Flanders said in an interview Wednesday.
“If they are not under contract, the state can’t wait forever to see if the sale is going to go through,” Flanders explained. “The state’s interests are to make sure a sale occurs. I don’t see a problem in the state looking to obtain alternative buyers under those circumstances.”
There also must be proven malicious intent, a condition Flanders again thought was lacking in this case.

Neronha declined to comment on the potential legal merits of Centurion’s claims against the state in an interview Wednesday. But, Neronha said Centurion failed to close the deal by the state-imposed Oct. 31 deadline, freeing up other suitors to come in.
Yet Neronha also said, “I don’t think anyone in state government should be a cheerleader for any potential purchaser of the state hospitals.”
Callaci in response sought to differentiate between a prospective buyer jumping in of their own accord, and Charest’s courtship of a company that had not already expressed interest.
“The governor and the health department are actively undermining their own transaction,” Callaci said. “That’s a different kettle of fish.”
Even if Prime makes an offer — something Callaci remains skeptical will materialize — the application must still go through a rigorous state review by the AG’s office and Rhode Island Department of Health. In Centurion’s case, it took over a year and multiple failed applications before a proposal passed muster with state regulators.
“We don’t have any time left,” Callaci said.
And Neronha promised that a new proposal would be subject to the same “intense” scrutiny and negotiations his office gave to Centurion, with strict conditions to ensure that the buyer keeps the facilities running.
“I’m not going to hand them over on a silver platter,” Neronha said Wednesday. “I don’t trust anybody. I’m objectively skeptical as a regulator.”
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary, said in an emailed response Tuesday that Prospect and the Centurion Foundation continue to work with state and private financing entities to close the transaction “at the earliest possible date.” 
Court filings indicate Centurion aims to close the deal by early or mid-December, relying on a bridge loan from Bank of America in lieu of investor-backed bond financing.
An update on the deal is scheduled for Nov. 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina is awarding $13.8 million to counties and communities to help rebuild critical business infrastructure after Helene, part of a state-funded program aimed at revitalizing commercial districts in the west.
The new round of funding will pay for 19 projects across the region, including three emergency projects. That includes restoring utilities like water, sewer and gas, as well as repairing roads, buildings and sidewalks.
Gov. Josh Stein called it a “much-needed shot in the arm to the Main Streets that businesses depend on” in a statement Wednesday.
“I’m proud of the work being done to restore critical infrastructure and help those communities recover,” Stein said.
The grant program, run by the NC Department of Commerce, totals $55 million. It was created by lawmakers as part of a Helene relief package passed in March, as Republicans skeptical of direct grants to businesses instead opted for other avenues to help revive them.
Nine other projects, totaling $7.3 million, were awarded funding through the program in July.
Stein has requested the Commerce division overseeing the grant program to modify the grant process, his office said, allowing cash-strapped local governments to access more of the money up front.
Among the projects funded by the new round of grants:

Almost $2.5 million to repair and rebuild the popular Biltmore Village region in Asheville, a tourist hotspot.
More than $2.7 million to repair sidewalks, ADA ramps, and other accessibility measures in Marshall.
Almost $1.8 million to Hendersonville to restore sidewalks and build new waterlines and fire hydrants.
More than $1.5 million to the town of Maggie Valley, which sought emergency funding to repair its sewer system.
$1 million for a new water main in Bryson City, also requested as emergency funding.
Over $1.2 million to the town of Hot Springs to restore ADA access and sidewalks.
$1 million to replace stormwater pipes in Black Mountain.
Just under $1 million to repair more than a mile of sidewalks in Swannanoa.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 14:57:36.038987

(Photo via Dave Bushaw campaign)An independent candidate, Dave Bushaw, announced he would join the race for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in 2026.
Bushaw, a 31-year-old Hawkeye resident, is campaigning for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican. Hinson is running for the open U.S. Senate seat, as Sen. Joni Ernst is not seeking another term in office.
While Bushaw has had experience in Democratic politics — he worked as an organizer for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2019 and 2020 in Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina — the candidate said he is running as an independent because “both parties walked away from the people who built this country.”

“There’s the Republican wing and the Democratic wing, but they are both part of the same bird that feeds the corporate class,” Bushaw said in a statement. “Politicians let corporate greed gut our main streets, poison our rivers, and turn neighbors against each other while they bootlick for donations and power. It’s time to take that power back and put it in the hands of the workers who keep this country alive.”
After working on Sanders’ campaign, Bushaw worked for United Today, Stronger Tomorrow, an organization focused on political organizing in rural communities to tackle issues like health care access and job losses. His campaign website also highlighted that he became one of the youngest self-made, first-generation independent farmland owners in the U.S. by starting a squash farm in Hawkeye called “Solidarity Fields” at age 19. He also has performed as a folk musician at labor union strikes throughout the country.
In a Wednesday video kicking off his campaign, Bushaw said he was running because politics has “turned into shouting matches and headlines” instead of being focused on addressing the needs of regular people.
“We deserve health care that doesn’t cripple our bank accounts, a job market that values workers over billionaires, and a government that wants to win the wars at home, not endless regime change war around the world,” Bushaw said.
Bushaw plans to hold his first campaign rally Nov. 22 in his hometown, West Union, at the Fayette County Fairgrounds.
There are several candidates running to become the nominees for both major parties — former state legislator Joe Mitchell, state Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, and state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, are running to become the GOP nominee.
State Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, are running as Democratic candidates.

Carmack/National Park Service)The state’s latest plan to kill bears in part of Western Alaska to try to boost a flagging caribou population has drawn a new legal challenge.
Environmental groups on Monday filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court that seeks to strike down the Alaska Board of Game’s July approval of a controversial predator control program in the part of the state used by the Mulchatna caribou herd.
The lawsuit, filed by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, is the latest step in a legal and political battle over state efforts to increase the herd size. It names the board, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the department’s commissioner as defendants. 
The lawsuit argues that the revived program approved by the Board of Game suffers from many of the same flaws that were in the previous program. That program had been approved by the board in 2022 but was overturned by court rulings earlier in the year that resulted from a previous lawsuit filed by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance.
Two state judges found that the program, under which 186 brown bears, five black bears and 20 wolves have been killed since 2023, violated the elements of the Alaska constitution.
Monday’s lawsuit says the new predator control program is largely the same as the old one and it continues to violate the Alaska constitution’s requirement for sustained yield of natural resources. For Alaska, the principle of sustained yield holds that renewable resources should be managed so that they can exist indefinitely.
There are two ways that the sustained yield requirement is violated, according to the lawsuit.
The board, when it approved the predator control plan presented by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, “failed to take a hard look at brown and black bear population data” for the targeted area, thus failing to properly consider impacts to those populations, the lawsuit said.
And the plan has no end point, meaning there is no trigger for suspension of predator control if bear populations drop below a minimum threshold deemed necessary for their sustainability, the lawsuit said.
“The Board of Game gave the Alaska Department of Fish and Game the authority to aerially shoot any bears of any age across 40,000 square miles until 2028, with no population data or cap on the number of bears killed,” Nicole Schmitt, executive director with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance.
She noted that the southeast border of the targeted area is only 3 miles from Lake Clark National Preserve, 30 miles from Katmai National Park and 50 miles from McNeil and Brooks Falls, sites that are world-famous for the large numbers of brown bears that gather there to fish for salmon. Meanwhile, the western border reaches two national wildlife refuges, “which means this program threatens bears who move across vast stretches of public lands,” she said.
Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the program “a disgraceful misuse of public resources and a betrayal of the trust Alaskans place in their wildlife managers.”
“There’s no excuse for the state of Alaska to be gunning down bears from helicopters,” Freeman said in the statement.
The commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game defended the program, though he did not specifically address the claims in the new lawsuit.
“ADF&G is committed to all users of the herd in rebuilding this population, which has been identified as important for providing high levels of human consumption under state statute and regulation,” Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said in a statement.
Vincent-Lang said “intensive management,” or IM, has shown to be helping the caribou herd. Intensive management is the term Alaska wildlife managers use for predator-control programs.
“There is strong evidence that neither disease nor nutrition are preventing this herd from recovering. Department predator removal efforts in the Mulchatna caribou herd IM program are administered to reduce wolf and bear populations in small, defined areas for short periods of time, to enhance caribou calf survival and to increase herd abundance,” Vincent-Lang said in his statement. “Predation has been isolated as the limiting factor preventing the herd from growing, and predator removal is increasing calf survival—we know that now—and we have seen increased calf survival as a result of our past IM efforts.”
The Mulchatna caribou herd crashed in recent decades, and there is heated debate about the cause.
The herd peaked at about 200,000 animals in 1997, when it provided up to 4,770 caribou for subsistence hunting in the region’s communities, according to the Department of Fish and Game. But the population crashed after then and is now estimated at about 16,000 animals, according to the department. Hunting has been closed in recent years.
State wildlife officials argue that predation by bears and wolves on caribou calves is the reason for the decline. The department has stated a goal of boosting the herd to a size ranging from 30,000 to 80,000 animals, enough to support resumption of hunting.
Backers of the Mulchatna predator control program have included the Alaska Federation of Natives, which passed a resolution in 2023 that supported the program because the organization says it is necessary to ensure food security in that part of the state.
But critics of the program, including some veteran Alaska wildlife biologists, argue that other factors caused the herd’s population crash. Among the cited factors is a change in habitat, driven by long-term warming, that makes the region less supportive of lichen-eating caribou and more favorable to moose and other animals dependent on woody plants. Migratory tundra caribou herds around the Arctic have suffered similar problems, with overall population declines of 65% in the past two to three decades, according to the 2024 Arctic Report Card released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The Board of Game and Department of Fish and Game have lost past court fights over Mulchatna predator control.
Aside from having judges rule that the earlier program was unconstitutional, one of the judges found in May that the department acted in bad faith by continuing to conduct aerial shooting this spring even after the program was declared legally void.

Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh must decide if language missing from the state Constitution’s directive on when and how to draw congressional district maps means lawmakers were allowed to redraw districts like they did in a September special session. 
For those challenging the new map, the omission means lawmakers overstepped their authority. 
Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing the challengers, said drafters of the constitution adopted in 1945 knew what they were doing when they left out the power to revise districts at will.
“We think that language is pretty clear on its face,” Hatfield said.
If the constitutional convention had intended to prevent mid-decade redistricting, the delegates would have included a prohibition, Louis Capozzi, solicitor general in Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office, told the judge Wednesday. 
Instead, he noted, they didn’t even discuss it.
“The General Assembly has the power to act unless the Missouri Constitution expressly takes a particular power away,” he said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers into special session in September at the insistence of President Donald Trump to give Republicans seven instead of six of Missouri’s eight congressional seats.
The new Missouri map targets the Kansas-City based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to flip to the Republican Party.
Trump wants to preserve and expand the GOP’s slim majority in Congress, where they have a 219-213 edge in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats have countered with gerrymandering plans in states they control, with California on Nov. 5  approving a plan to deliver up to five seats to Democrats.
The Missouri Republican Party, which intervened in the case, argued that Limbaugh didn’t have the power to consider the challenge. The federal Constitution grants state legislatures exclusive power over the time, place and manner of congressional elections, Washington, D.C., attorney John Gore said, subject only to federal law.
“That means courts, including this court, do not have free reign to review and invalidate state legislative enactments on federal elections, including congressional redistricting plans,” Gore said.
At the end of Wednesday’s 45-minute trial, Limbaugh gave attorneys on both sides 10 days to file proposed judgments. No decision will be delivered until after those filings.
The case is one of six pending in various courts concerning the new map. 
One case, filed by the Missouri NAACP, challenged the authority of Kehoe to call lawmakers into a special session for redistricting. Limbaugh ruled against the NAACP but an appeal is certain.
The next case to be heard will be a Thursday trial before Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green over an effort to force a referendum on the map. The trial, postponed from Nov. 3, will be over whether a referendum petitioning effort can begin before legislation has been signed by the governor.
A federal trail scheduled for Nov. 25 will test whether a state referendum on a redistricting plan violates the U.S. Constitution.
Two other cases, filed in Jackson County, contest various aspects of the gerrymandered map, including whether a Kansas City voting district was inadvertently placed into two separate districts. 
The constitutional directive on redistricting mandates that Missouri lawmakers revise district lines after census results are delivered to the state. The provision mandates that the districts be as equal in population as possible and made up of compact, continuous territory.
The current district boundaries were set in 2022 after the 2020 census.
The provision creates an obligation to redistrict after a census and no obligation to do it at any other time, Capozzi said. But without an express prohibition, lawmakers are free to do so.
And, he added, the boundaries of congressional districts are a political question the courts should avoid.
“This court cannot wade into that political fight without an express warrant,” he said.
The case is more ordinary than Capozzi portrayed it, Hatfield said. He likened it to every other challenge to new legislation.
That means the courts must measure it against the prohibitions on legislative power, both expressly stated and interpreted. In the case of the silence on mid-decade congressional redistricting, he said, Limbaugh should look at the provisions governing how legislative districts are determined.
That provision allows districts to be “altered from time to time as public convenience may require. The omission of that language is a conscious choice made by the drafters of the constitution, he said.
“The state’s view seems to say that you need a ‘thou shalt not’ sentence in here,” Hatfield said. “That’s never been the law in Missouri.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_1113-scaled-e1762973502477-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 13:57:38.794940

Ron DeSantis’ delay in announcing special election dates to fill two vacancies in the Florida Legislature, voters in parts of Palm Beach and Hillsborough counties will not have representation in Tallahassee when the regular legislative session begins in January.
That situation could not occur under a bill filed in the Florida Senate on Wednesday.
The proposal (SB 460) by Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, says that whenever there is a vacancy for which a special election is required, the governor would be required to fix the dates of a special primary and general election within 14 days after the vacancy occurs.
The bill also says that if a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the Senate or House less than 126 days before the first day of the regular legislative session, the governor must within five days set those election dates. The dates set must provide for at least two weeks between the special primary election and special general election and “must ensure that both elections are held before the first day of the regular legislative session to prevent a lapse in representation.”
The measure says that if the governor fails to set those election dates in the time proscribed, “any qualified elector” living in the affected district may file a petition in circuit court to set those election dates.
DeSantis selected then-state Sen. Jay Collins from Florida’s Senate District 14 to become his lieutenant governor on Aug. 12. He did not announce the special election dates to choose his successor until Oct. 24, some 73 days later.
The governor selected Rep. Mike Caruso, R-Palm Beach, to serve as the Palm Beach Clerk of the County Court on Aug. 18. He did not announce the special election dates for Caruso’s House District 87 seat until Oct. 24, 67 days after the seat became vacant.
In both cases, the primary elections are set for Jan. 13, 2026, the day the 2026 regular legislative starts. The special elections in both districts are scheduled for March 24, 2026. That’s more than a week after the session is scheduled to conclude on March 13.
The ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit in late September regarding the governor’s failure at that point to announce election dates for the Senate District 14 seat.
“I’m not sure why the governor proves himself repeatedly unwilling to call timely special elections,” said Nicholas Warren, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida, in a press release issued on Sept. 30. “His predecessors like Jeb Bush and Rick Scott always acted swiftly to ensure citizens retained their voice in government. Governor DeSantis’ refusal to follow their example is not just concerning, it’s also against the law.”
The civil liberties group filed a lawsuit on behalf of Santa Rosa and Brevard county voters in January, after state Rep. Joel Rudman and state Sen. Randy Fine vacated their seats to run for Congress. The lawsuit noted that DeSantis had not set special election dates more than six weeks after the lawmakers announced their resignations.
A House companion to Polsky’s measure has not yet been introduced.

(Getty Images)West Virginia public schools say they need around $252 million for school safety upgrades, including security cameras, weapon detection systems and resource officers.
Not every project will be funded due to funding at the local and state level.
Micah Whitlow
“There’s a big need out there for things,” said Micah Whitlow, director of the West Virginia Department of Education’s Office of School Facilities. Whitlow presented the West Virginia school safety and security report Wednesday to state school board members.
He explained that some of the requests for safety upgrades this year are out of counties’ abilities to pay for from their own school budgets. 
Local school systems spent $40.7 million on safety expenditures during the 2024-25 school year, the school safety report said.
Jackson County had the largest safety funding request for the current school year, seeking more than $55 million for projects. The district spent $446,192 in local funds on the projects last year. 
Marion County had the second highest request at $15 million. The West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind said they needed $1.5 million. 
Schools have made progress on installing safe school entries — also known as mantraps — that include a monitored single point of entry and exit with a system of doors and barriers to vet visitors. There are 401 schools with the mantraps, but 232 are still seeking around $52 million in funding to install their own. 
“In 2020, when all this started … 368 schools needed safe school entries,” Whitlow said. “There has been that gradual decline of that need due to counties, you know, taking a priority for safety and investing funds.”
Last year, state school officials said they needed $258 million for safety projects, but state and local funding fell short to accomplish many of the proposed projects. 
The 2025-26 funding requests included more than $30 million for prevention and resources officers — an annual recurring cost due to salaries and benefits. Schools also requested $30 million for security cameras to provide video covers in classrooms, outdoor areas, entries and more. 
The School Board Authority is currently mulling over how they’ll hand out $43.5 million in funding after 31 counties submitted their requests for projects, including some school safety upgrades like safe school entries. The requests submitted amounted to more than $170 million, and the SBA will make an announcement of approved projects in December. 
“It’s amazing how many counties [that] need help,” said state school board Vice President Victor Gabriel. “It’s a shame we don’t have money to grant them all. There’s some really worthwhile projects out there.”
State department of education leaders will present the school safety needs to lawmakers in the coming weeks ahead of the 2026 legislative session, when the Legislature will determine the level of public education funding and school safety funding.
Whitlow noted that some of the projected needs included a request from lawmakers about how much it would cost to put security cameras in all West Virginia schools.

Connecticut doesn’t have a law that caps rent increases, despite housing advocates’ attempts to lobby for one before the legislature.
Connecticut does require municipalities with a population of 25,000 or more to establish fair rent commissions. The commissions have the power to limit or reverse increases after a review of complaints filed by tenants, although landlords can appeal decisions in court.
Certain protected tenants who live in a municipality without a fair rent commission may bring action to the Superior Court.
A 2024 law also requires landlords to give tenants at least 45 days’ written notice of rent increases or for those with lease terms of one month or less, a notice that equals the length of the lease.
Residents rank the cost and availability of housing as one of the top issues facing the state, according to a recent YouGov poll, commissioned by the Connecticut Regional Plan Association.

(Photo by Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)There have been some important developments in Louisiana higher education in recent weeks, including LSU firing its football coach, replacing its athletics director and hiring a new system president and chancellor. 
One you could have missed was the first meeting of the committee that will guide the University of New Orleans’ move from the University of Louisiana System to the LSU System. You might not have been aware because LSU neglected to follow the state’s Open Meetings Law and post the required public notice 24 hours before the group met on the UNO campus Nov. 5y. 
It wasn’t until Illuminator reporter Piper Hutchinson contacted LSU that the school posted the notice online around 4 p.m. the day before; that’s 17 hours before the meeting started , if you’re keeping track.
The only time public bodies, which include the UNO transition committee, can skirt the 24-hour notice rule is in the event of an emergency, according to attorney Scott Sternberg, who often represents the news media in cases involving open meetings, public records and other First Amendment concerns.
“The right to observe meetings of the government is in the Constitution. That means it’s one of our most important rights,” Sternberg said. “In theory, the meeting could be completely annulled based on the failure to notify.”
The meeting did take place, and it revealed LSU’s continued struggle to grasp the Open Meetings Law. 
Rico Alvendia, the LSU Board of Supervisors member who’s chairing the UNO transition committee, told the dozens of members gathered they should meet privately in assigned workgroups in the coming weeks to come up with recommendations for the full committee to consider. 
This, too, would be a violation of state law.
“A subgroup or a working group, or whatever you like, if it’s a division of a larger public body, that’s a committee” that must adhere to the Open Meetings Law, Sternberg said.
In attendance at the meeting was Trey Jones, LSU’s general counsel. The university’s top attorney told the Illuminator he didn’t consider the subcommittees subject to the law.
“It’s a little different,” Jones said. “We’re relying on expertise of people, and not so much a committee that’s gathering its own information in an open setting, voting on what to bring to this committee.”
“These work groups will come up and bring things that will either be rejected or accepted by the larger group,” he added.
That sounds just like a legislative committee, or the subcommittee of any policymaking public body that considers proposals and then advances them to the group as a whole for further deliberations. And as much as Jones might want to consider the UNO transition committee’s plans an informal spitballing session, state law doesn’t allow such informality.    
UNO and its future under the LSU System might not directly impact you, but there’s cause for concern when the state’s Open Meetings Law is so casually overlooked. LSU is easily one of the state’s most powerful institutions, with the governor hand-picking its board and routinely weighing in on leadership decisions.
Transparency should be paramount with so much at stake in terms of public resources and the school that helped build the New Orleans workforce.

(Photo courtesy of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles)After a lengthy development process, Virginians will now be able to use their smartphones at select locations to share their personal identification cards, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced on Wednesday morning.
With the debut of Virginia Mobile ID, Virginians may use it at Transportation Security Administration security checkpoints in airports, at select Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority stores and at Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) customer service centers.
Virginia adopted standards for electronic credentials years ago. What happened?

The new digital ID tool comes as smartphones infiltrate nearly every aspect of modern life, with people using them to pay for services, access vital information and easily share their personal credentials, including state IDs and driver’s licenses.
“Most of us rely heavily on our phones, which is why Virginians should have access to a safe, secure form of mobile identification on the devices they use all the time,” Secretary of Transportation W. Sheppard Miller III said in a statement.“The Virginia Mobile ID option protects your identity and privacy in the digital age, keeping you in control of what information you share.”
Over 250 TSA checkpoints nationwide, including several at airports in Virginia — Richmond (RIC), Reagan Washington National, Washington-Dulles, Norfolk, Newport News/Williamsburg, and Roanoke — will accept Virginia’s Mobile ID, which is available at no cost in the Apple Store and Google Play.
Virginia State Police, all DMV customer service centers, and nine Virginia ABC stores in the Richmond area will also accept the ID.
The agency is still working to expand the app to be used across the commonwealth at retailers, restaurants, and with local law-enforcement agencies. Virginia expects to roll out the Mobile ID program with digital wallets in the coming months.
In 2017, the lawmakers passed legislation creating the standards for issuing, reviewing and displaying electronic credentials after the DMV conducted a year-long pilot research program.
One of the chief concerns with the application has been privacy.
DMV, which has touted the app as “secure,” said in its releases that, instead of users handing over a full ID — or even a phone — Virginians can choose exactly which information to share and authorize each request, such as confirming they’re over 21 without disclosing their name and address. 
The agency said data is transmitted securely via encryption directly between a customer’s phone and electronic reader devices, and never stores or tracks user activity.
The agency is also the founding member of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators’ Digital Trust Service, a nationwide security protocol and intrastate clearinghouse for mobile ID. The agency said this ensures Virginia Mobile ID is one of the most secure digital credentials available. 
“The commonwealth has long been a leader in innovation and Virginia Mobile ID is the latest example of how we’re modernizing services for residents,” Gerald Lackey, DMV commissioner, said in a statement. “Over the next few months, we’ll continue expanding mobile ID acceptance with partners, while adding new functionality, such as digital wallet integration. Virginians are well positioned for a digital-first world with Virginia Mobile ID.”

The audit says existing information is inadequate to fully understand financial implications of decisions by agencies to lease or rent office space. In this Jan. 16, 2025, image, Proffitt speaks to a committee of the Kansas Legislature at the Capitol. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Department of Administration responded to a report from the Kansas Legislature’s auditors by promising to upgrade outdated systems for determining costs of operating state office buildings and to reform a flawed approach to setting rental rates for state agencies.
The state of Kansas owned or leased 4.1 million square feet of office space across the state in the fiscal year ending July 1, but the Legislature’s auditing division found the Department of Administration didn’t have detailed written policies guiding estimation of operating costs or setting of rates for renters, the auditor said.
State auditors said it was “critical” the agency blend state budget and accounting systems to produce firm data. The Department of Administration committed to improving its property management practices.
The audit also said Kansas didn’t have a “regimented, formal process where a single agency examines agencies’ needs and determines the best option for both square footage and leasing versus owning. Instead, agencies have a lot of discretion in determining what works best for them.”
Frank Burnam, deputy secretary for operations at the Department of Administration, said the audit requested by Sen. Rick Billinger, R-Goodland, was appreciated because it exposed shortcomings in property management.
“It really kind of helped open our eyes into some really old, antiquated ways of calculating and determining what these costs are,” he said.
Burnam said the Department of Administration would strive to set multiyear lease rates for state agencies rather than adjust rates annually. A flat rate would provide more consistency for state agencies and reflect methods common to commercial landlords.
 
78 agencies, 524 properties
In the report released to the Legislature’s joint auditing committee this week, analysts said the state leased or owned 4.1 million square feet of office space. Two-thirds was leased from private owners, while 32% was held by the state. Overall, agencies were bound by terms of 241 lease agreements.
The audit revealed 5% of the state offices were acquired through other means. Lansing Correctional Facility was built with a lease-purchase contract. The legislative, judicial and executive branches of state government occupy 189,000 square feet of space in the Capitol or Kansas Judicial Center, but none pay for office space. Those costs were covered with a “monumental building surcharge” of $3.30 per square foot assessed against state agencies leasing space elsewhere in Shawnee County.
The audit focused on 524 state properties affiliated with 78 state agencies. The report documented state agencies’ office space in 102 of 105 counties. The outliers, for purposes of this audit, were Elk, Stanton and Wichita counties. The report excluded property in hands of state universities, school districts and district courts.
Currently, the Department of Administration must approve state agency lease agreements. The secretary of administration must inform the Legislature’s joint building committee before approving leases of privately owned space with more than 10,000 square feet or for periods longer than two years.
The Legislature and Kansas governor have direct roles in deciding whether the state purchased or built office space.
“None of these processes or approvals require agencies to formally compare the advantages, disadvantages and costs of leasing office space to purchasing office space,” the audit said.
The audit said at least 106 of 241 state agency lease agreements for privately owned buildings were for periods of more than 10 years.
It would cost the state an estimated $16.5 million to terminate all state office leases as of July 2025, auditors said. The largest penalty for breaking leases — at a cost of  about $4 million — was for two Kansas Department of Revenue locations in Topeka, the report said.
Most state agencies said they had sufficient space for all employees if they were required to work from an office. Only 24 agencies among the 78 audited said they lacked space to accommodate every staff member. Deficient agencies included the Kansas Board of Cosmetology and Kansas Department of Education.
“We’re moving into an era of AI where less office work is going to be needed, as well as more people are working in the field or remotely,” said Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta.
State agencies reported 16 of 524 office space locations across the state had unused space. Four had been unoccupied for more than five years. Three had areas unfit for occupancy. For example, Kansas Neurological Institute had a building with a mold problem and leaking roof.
 
Leased or owned
In fiscal year 2025, the audit said, state agencies in Topeka reported leasing costs for privately owned buildings were less than state-owned buildings. Auditors said the potential benefit of ownership was muddled because “DOA data on the cost of state-owned office buildings wasn’t reliable.”
Adam Proffitt, secretary of the Department of Administration, said the agency was responsible for care of the entirety of state buildings, including space that wasn’t leasable. That could be responsible for driving up the cost of state-owned property in Shawnee County, he said.
He said the Department of Administration also was obligated to make debt payments on two buildings in the Capitol Complex, and those payments were baked into leases for state-owned property.
“To be clear, D of A is not disputing that many of the leases of private office space are lower than those of state-owned space,” Proffitt said.
One-fourth of rebuilt Docking State Office Building comprised office space. New tenants include the Kansas Highway Patrol, Kansas secretary of state, state Department of Commerce and the Department of Administration.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, said the Legislature ought to determine why the secretary of the Kansas Department of Agriculture had an office in Topeka and Manhattan.
“Little things like that are just kind of ridiculous,” Tyson said. “Especially as a taxpayer.”
In 2013, then-Gov. Sam Brownback moved the Department of Agriculture to a building adjacent to the Kansas State University campus. The department maintained administrative offices in Topeka.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Profitt-on-budget-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 13:57:38.794940

Free.,US House Dems say newly released Epstein emails show Trump knew about abuse,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dems-say-newly-released-epstein-emails-show-trump-knew-about-abuse,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released emails Wednesday they say show President Donald Trump knew about the financier’s abuse of underage girls as far back as 2011.The three emails released by Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform were among 23,000 pages of documents turned over to the committee by Epstein’s estate, according to Democrats.In a 2011 correspondence with the now-convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein wrote that Trump “spent hours at my house” with a victim whose name is redacted from the email. In the same email, Epstein refers to Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” In a 2015 email exchange between Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff, Wolff tells Epstein that he’s heard CNN will ask Trump about his relationship with the financier. The two have an exchange about how to hypothetically “craft an answer” for Trump. Wolff responds, “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable (public relations) and political currency.”In a January 2019 email, also to Wolff, Epstein referenced a victim’s name, redacted, as having been at Trump’s Florida estate and private club, Mar-a-Lago, and wrote “Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” Emails raise more questions, leading Dem saysHouse Oversight Committee Ranking Member Robert Garcia said in a statement Wednesday the emails ""raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.”“The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately. The Oversight Committee will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims,” Garcia continued.Within hours of the committee Democrats’ release of the emails, committee Republican leaders issued a brief press release linking to “an additional 20,000 pages of documents received from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein” contained on Google Drive and Dropbox clouds. The White House did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Congress investigates after FBI backtracksThe bipartisan committee investigation began shortly after the FBI released a July memo stating the Department of Justice would not be releasing any further information on the government’s sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.Epstein was found dead, apparently by suicide, in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell where he was awaiting federal trial.The FBI’s announcement that the agency would not release further details caused a firestorm of demands to release all investigative material, even among Trump’s supporters in Congress and far-right media influencers, including Megyn Kelly and the late Charlie Kirk. Trump campaigned on releasing what are often referred to as the “Epstein files.”A bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives is aiming to force a vote on the release of the files as soon as this week after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swears in Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva. Grijalva has pledged to be the final signature needed on a discharge petition by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., that will compel a floor vote on a bill to release all Epstein investigation files.Massie and Khanna hosted a press conference on Capitol Hill in early September featuring several women who told stories of abuse by Epstein and Maxwell.Since the FBI memo, a magnifying glass has been fixed on Trump’s past relationship with Epstein. The president sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump allegedly gave to Epstein. The card featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s apparent signature mimicking pubic hair. The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. Trump has denied the reports.",,,,2025-11-12 12:56:58.763843

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)School districts have made some progress in addressing the national shortage of school bus drivers, but there still aren’t as many drivers as there were in 2019, according to a new study.
The number of drivers has increased by 2,300, or 1.1%, since last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group. But there are still 21,200 fewer bus drivers than there were in 2019, a decline of 9.5%.
The researchers link the employment gain to higher wages: Average hourly wages are up 4.2% in the past year, the largest jump since the COVID-19 pandemic.
During and after the pandemic, many bus drivers retired, left the workforce or in some cases, died. Districts across the country have had to scramble to find someone to take the wheel — be it substitute teachers, administrators or even parents.
The number of bus drivers decreased by 15% between September 2019 and September 2023, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Private school bus contractors now account for 38% of the nation’s pupil transportation services, according to the National School Transportation Association.
Other school transportation options, such as ride-hailing services, have helped fill the gap in some places. But roughly half of all U.S. K–12 students rely on a school bus to get to school.
The report warns that school district budgets are tightening as federal pandemic relief funds have expired, and notes that the Trump administration has delayed some federal K-12 funding in its bid to shrink and eventually eliminate the U.S. Department of Education.
The report points to  Maine, Missouri, and Vermont as states that are dealing with especially severe bus driver shortages. It also notes that a dearth of drivers has a particularly pronounced effect on students with disabilities, and that not having enough drivers can lead to inconsistent bus schedules and routes, which contributes to absenteeism and missed school meals.

The 2-1 vote in late October reverses rate caps the FCC adopted last year under a 2023 law that allows the agency to set limits on prison phone and video call rates. Critics say the rates are kept high by limited competition among major providers such as Securus Technologies and ViaPath.
Under the new interim rules, phone calls will cost up to $0.11 per minute in large prisons and $0.18 per minute in the smallest jails. Video calls will cost up to $0.23 per minute in large facilities and as much as $0.41 in small ones.
Only three states — Florida, Kentucky and Oklahoma — currently have rates above the new rates, meaning most prison systems across the country are already below the previously adopted 2024 rate caps.
The new 2025 rates will take effect 120 days after being published in the Federal Register.
In June, the FCC had abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing the 2024 rate caps after receiving complaints from local sheriffs and prison telecom companies. Republican attorneys general from 14 states also filed a lawsuit last year challenging the commission’s authority to limit how much prisons and jails can charge for phone calls, arguing that the rules deprived correctional facilities of needed funding.
Republican Commissioners Brendan Carr and Olivia Trusty, both appointed by President Donald Trump, supported the rollback. Carr argued the previous caps limited facilities’ ability to recover safety and security costs, such as monitoring calls, leading some to scale back or eliminate calling services altogether. Trusty said the 2024 rules “did not always strike the right balance,” and cited “unintended consequences” like service disruptions in some facilities.
At least one small jail — in Baxter County, Arkansas — ended phone services earlier this year in protest of the lower rate caps.
Democratic Commissioner Anna Gomez, appointed by President Joe Biden, voted against the order and called it “indefensible.” She said the decision gives monopoly telecom providers “the authority to increase the costs for families to maintain critical connections with their loved ones in prison.”
Advocates for incarcerated people condemned the vote.
“These changes are a betrayal of the families who entrusted the FCC to protect them from the notoriously predatory correctional telecom industry,” Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, said in a news release. Worth Rises is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The FCC’s latest decision comes months after New York joined California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons. Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026.
At least two states — Maryland and Missouri — considered legislation this year to make prison and jail calls more affordable. Maryland’s proposal to make calls free in state prisons did not pass, but Missouri enacted a law in August capping phone call rates at no more than 12 cents per minute in correctional centers.

Seconds later, Avila had grabbed his two dogs, car keys, put on his boots and run downstairs, not knowing he was set to lose the place he had called home for more than 25 years.
The basement fire at 271 Wethersfield Ave. forced the evacuation of 17 adults and seven children, according to the American Red Cross. It was the third fire in October that left unhoused tenants and units affected across Hartford.
“We have been fighting for three years for them to take responsibility for fixing all the problems and to pay more attention to these apartments, this is just not fair,” said Avila, who works installing flooring.

He had come back from a night shift like the majority of the tenants that work long shifts or hold more than one job in the Barry Square building.
The fire was not an isolated case in Hartford, where 83 house fires have happened between January and October this year, according to Mario Oquendo Jr., district chief of the Hartford Fire Department.
Just next to the Wethersfield Avenue building there is a blighted building from a January fire, and around the corner, a burned house from a summer fire, where four people died.
In the days following the October fire, the 271 Wethersfield Ave. tenants were not able to return right away and claim the family belongings they had to leave behind when they escaped.
Avila hoped his video cassettes and photos, some of which he brought with him from Aguascalientes, Mexico, when he came to the U.S., were still there and would not be stolen if someone broke into the locked up burnt building.

Service requests
Tenants from 271 and 267 Wethersfield Ave., along with housing equity organizer from the organization Make the Road, Teresa Quintana, said they have organized to fight for better housing conditions for the last three years.
“Every Tuesday we would go into one of those garages in the back and they would start the meeting and talking and saying ‘this is happening’ and ‘we want this to change’,” Quintana recalls. “Then they would send letters to the landlord, and they would complain as a group to the city again, and again.”
Quintana said when she initially organized tenants to send complaints to the city about cockroaches, rats and roof leaks, the forms were in English, and most of the tenants spoke Spanish only.
“There weren’t any complaints before because the form wasn’t even in Spanish. If there is no language accessibility, obviously people might have started to complain more,” Quintana said.
The tenants rallied several times — in December 2023, January 2024 and February 2025 — calling out the mayor to hold the landlord accountable for hazardous living conditions and not having their basic services met like garbage disposal, heat and hot water. The last rally was on Nov. 3 demanding justice about the fire.
Avila, who is one of the tenants who has lived there the longest, says the living conditions worsened after the longtime landlord sold it to Alpha Capital Funds and then All is Good LLC. The property management company was Arlington Group LLC, and now is Mint Management Group LLC.
In total, the properties at 267 and 271 Wethersfield Ave. have 31 service requests for urgent and non-urgent maintenance issues. From heater and boiler failures, to roof leaks that freeze the stairs during the winter to door and window repairs.
Mint Management Group LLC said they responded to the maintenance requests.
“We had service issues and we addressed them, we sent our workers,” a representative of the company responded. “We feel so sorry for what happened, we feel bad for our tenants.”

Hartford’s public records show the management company, Mint Management Group LLC, has an incomplete rental license application. The direct legal landlord is Israel Wiznitzer, who also has an incomplete rental license application in Hartford.
Wiznitzer could not be reached for comment.
Cristian Corza-Godinez, spokesman for the City of Hartford, said an application is considered “complete” only upon the submittal of the application form with payment of the required fee for the license. If the fee is not paid, the application is considered “incomplete,” which means it’s not filed. Rental license applications are tracked through the city’s online software system. The owner is notified that the fee must be paid, as was done in the case of the owner of 267 Wethersfield Ave. on three occasions. A notice of violation for failure to apply for a rental license is the next step.
Sarah White, attorney for Connecticut Fair Housing Center, said the fines are placed on the building as a lien and can be prioritized over mortgages. The city could try to foreclose on the liens.
“The City of Hartford will continue to use every tool at our disposal to hold problematic landlords accountable for their actions, or lack thereof,” Corza-Godinez said in a statement. “Senior city officials have had ongoing conversations with the property owners of the affected building, and the City of Hartford’s Tenant Liaison has been on the ground having direct conversations with tenants to provide needed support. In a city where so many families rent their homes, Mayor Arulampalam and his administration will continue to push every landlord to meet their obligations to provide adequate housing for our residents.”
Owners who have not attempted to file an application have been issued notices of violation for any buildings with 10 or more units. Owners who applied incompletely will be receiving a notice of violation by Nov. 30, the city spokesman said.
“‘Are they waiting for our building to burn down?’ tenants told us last year, because for years we’ve been complaining about the way they’re maintaining this building, and it happened, it burned,” Quintana said.

The fallout
After the fire, the building was secured and labeled as unsafe. Tenants were told to not enter or it would be considered trespassing. But break-ins happened that weekend, according to neighbor Tangela Perry, who called the police.
Tenants were allowed to retrieve their belongings on Nov. 5, six days after the fire. A contractor, who declined to give his name, got hired by the management company to open up the building, which had wooden boards sealing off the entrances.
As tenants began to enter their apartments, they realized a lot of their family’s valuable belongings were gone. 
“All that, gone, that’s not replaceable,” said tenant Ronald Bozeman, referring to his parents’ jewelry.

When police arrived, the tenants reported their lost and stolen property.
“I used to be homeless. I used to couch surf. I worked so hard to get here. And nobody cares,” tenant Ryan Pirre said.
Those with no children expressed their emotions out loud more, compared to the those with children, who swallowed up their tears and just kept packing as the neighbors watched out for their sons and daughters playing in front of the apartment building. 
Avila was silent, as his daughter helped him pack his clothes. His video cassettes were still in a drawer, and a yellow envelope of his family photos laid on top of his bed.
“I wanted to cry, I felt that pain inside me, I wanted to cry, but nothing came out,” Avila said.
The tenants were told to retrieve their belongings from Wednesday, Nov. 5 until Friday, Nov 7. On Friday, Avila said he saw contractors demolishing parts of the building, while tenants were still moving out their belongings.
Mint Management LLC did not answer when asked for comment.

Displaced
Pirre lived at 271 Wethersfield Ave. for less than six months, and has had sleepless nights after the fire while staying in a motel with his girlfriend and three cats.
Through the Relocation Assistance Act, Pirre, like the rest of the unhoused tenants, have the right to relocation benefits from the city. They get emergency housing — like the motel Pirre was staying in for up to two weeks — temporary housing, storage, payment of moving expenses and up to $4,000 towards a new apartment.
The city’s resources might alleviate tenants’ immediate shelter concerns, but the trauma lingers.
“I woke up from a nightmare that the motel that I was in was burning and that I had to gather my cats again, that I had to get my girlfriend out of there,” Pirre said.

Days after the fire, Pirre was having a walk around Broad Street during his lunch break when he had a flashback of the fire in the middle of the day.
“There was another fire response happening at that exact moment, I just immediately had a super intense flashback of that moment of smelling wood burning and choking on the air and my eyes burning and thinking that I was going to die. I had to close my eyes, I had to just focus on my breathing,” Pirre recalls.
Avila says on the night of the fire he could not sleep due to chest pain and he thinks it’s because he inhaled smoke. He did not consider going to the hospital to get checked since he had asked for time off from his job, unpaid. All he could think about was his housing situation.
“I was still overwhelmed in my head thinking ‘well, I’ve lost my home and my memories,’ so I thought this chest pain would go away, and so far it has, thank God,” he said.

Quintana and Make the Road, along with the Connecticut Fair Housing Center, are meeting with the tenants regularly, to closely follow up their recovery efforts and ensure that their rights are respected.
Avila received the city’s notice that he can stay in a hotel for now and got the $4,000 of aid to get a new apartment, but says it’s not enough accountability.
“Whatever they can give us it’s useless if tomorrow there’s a fire in another building and a loss of life,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_WethersfieldAve_077-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 12:56:58.763843

Uthmeier stressed during a Brooksville press conference that Nathan Holmberg, accused of videoing the rape of five children under 12 in Hernando County — with more rapes suspected statewide — is an example of why the U.S. Supreme Court needs to reconsider the 2008 precedent at issue.

“[This is] nothing more than pure evil,” Uthmeier said, imploring Floridians who have information on Holmberg to contact his office. “Crimes like this against young children, where you take their innocence, you take their childhood away from them, these horrific acts deserve the ultimate form of justice.”
Holmberg was arrested on Oct. 20 after a “Good Samaritan” notified the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office that he had child pornography on his phone, according to county Sheriff Al Nienhuis. What authorities found was “one of the most heinous investigations,” Rita Peters — special counsel to the attorney general who’s worked in the sex crimes unit for more than 25 years — had ever seen.
Holmberg was indicted Monday by a Hernando grand jury on seven counts of sexual battery of a child under 12 years old, four counts of lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12 years old, three counts of lewd and lascivious conduct, and 10 counts of promoting a sexual performance by a child between December 2024 and Oct. 20, 2025 — the date he was arrested.
A nanny, babysitter, and worker at the local YMCA, Holmberg was also charged with 83 counts of possession of child pornography. He’s lived in Duval, Pasco, Pinellas, and Hernando counties over the past decade.
According to the partially redacted grand jury indictment, Holmberg took multiple videos of himself raping and coercing young children into sexual acts. The document paints a horrific picture of children between 3 and 10 years old wearing Jurassic Park, Minecraft, or Hello Kitty clothing as Holmberg molests them.
‘This is not an individual that can be rehabilitated’
Florida in 2023 passed landmark legislation expanding the state’s death penalty to include suspects who rape children younger than 12. It was the first law of its kind after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing child rapists was unconstitutional if the victim wasn’t killed.
That case, called Kennedy v. Louisiana, has been viewed as a massive roadblock for pro-death penalty advocates like Uthmeier, who’s made it his mission as attorney general to argue for severe penalties for child predators and to sue companies like Roblox and Snapchat for allegedly failing to prevent child molesters from communicating with kids.

“We believe that today’s Supreme Court should reevaluate and reinterpret the law to allow this form of justice. You have somebody that raped and sexually abused a three-year-old and filmed it. The evidence shows hundreds of files, photos, and videos of other child pornographic and abuse content,” Uthmeier said.
“Again, this is not an individual that can be rehabilitated, this is someone that needs to face the ultimate form of justice.”
Uthmeier in September led 15 states in asking U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to co-sign various state efforts to execute child rapists. Weeks after Uthmeier emailed his letter to Bondi, she joined President Donald Trump to announce planned expansions of the death penalty.
But these efforts haven’t been met with unanimous support. Maria DeLiberato, legal and policy director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, called Uthmeier’s efforts to overturn Kennedy v. Louisiana “unusual” and even harmful.
“They have lost sight of the fact that by seeking the death penalty in [child rape] cases, all they have accomplished is a guarantee for years and years of extensive and expensive litigation, an ongoing infliction of trauma to living child victims, and decades of uncertainty on appeal,” she said in a statement to the Phoenix. “The current punishment for these horrific allegations is already … a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.  
“It is also unusual for the attorney general himself to prosecute cases and use the resources of his office to do so when there is already a State Attorney’s Office with the necessary experience and funding to handle these types of complex prosecutions,” she added.
Florida’s child rape statute isn’t the only example of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ massive push to expand the death penalty. In 2023, DeSantis signed a law lowering the threshold for death penalty sentencing from a unanimous jury decision to an 8-4 supermajority. This year, he signed off on human trafficking as another crime worthy of execution and expanded the aggravated factors needed to recommend a death sentence.
Similarly, DeSantis has shattered Florida’s long-standing one-year record of eight executions set in 1984: in 2025 so far, he’s already scheduled 18 executions and conducted 15.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 17:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Expand funding for food assistance programs in CT,Maria G. Limon-Cerezo,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/expand-funding-for-food-assistance-programs-in-ct/,"Facing this winter without SNAP benefits will leave my family in a vulnerable position, making it difficult to ensure we have enough to eat.","My heart sank as I read the text message my parents asked me to translate for them. Although they understand some English, they wanted to make sure that they were reading the statement from the Department of Social Services correctly. 
Reading the text, The federal government announced that there will not be any new SNAP benefits in November, immediately triggered stress, fear, and a sense of vulnerability for both my parents and I.
The feeling of anxiety seemed familiar. I live with my parents and four siblings and we depend on SNAP and WIC for food security. Every winter, we always struggle to keep the fridge full as my dad is the only source of income in the family. His work in construction and home improvement slows down dramatically during the colder months, leaving us with less money to cover for basic needs. This winter, our access to food is even more important as we have recently been blessed with a young sibling. 


Facing this upcoming winter season without the SNAP benefits would leave us in an even more vulnerable position, making it incredibly difficult to ensure we have enough to eat or meet the additional needs of our growing family.
Since finding out that SNAP benefits will be cut, my mind has been racing with questions: How will we manage? What will we eat? Will we even eat? This lump in my throat has not gone away as I think about many other households that are in the exact same position as us. Just like my family, there are families that have been living paycheck-to-paycheck even before cuts to food-assistance programs were announced – in CT, about 391,000 people, roughly 10.6% of the state’s population, receive SNAP benefits each month. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it can be for families to afford not just healthy meals but meals in general, especially during times of financial stress and recent food costs.

Maria G. Limon-Cerezo
It’s not just low income families with kids that are being affected by this. The elderly, especially those retired, people with disabilities, and people with chronic illnesses are part of this community as well.
Even brief periods without enough nutritious food can be life-threatening. Many individuals with diet-related conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease depend on SNAP benefits to afford the healthy foods they need to stay well. Because these benefits are now unavailable, these individuals will now have to turn to cheaper options which are usually highly processed options or will even have to skip meals. Both options are just as bad for their health.
Although food insecurity is present in every community, some parts of Connecticut have a higher rate than others. According to Feeding America, a non-profit organization, they’ve noticed that residents from Greater Bridgeport, South Central Connecticut, Naugatuck Valley, Capitol Region, and Southeastern Connecticut have food insecurity rates higher than the state average, while lower northeastern CT have significantly lower rates than the state average. Data also shows that Black/African American and Hispanic/Latine families have a higher rate for facing food insecurity than that of White families not just in Connecticut, but nationwide. Part of the reason includes uneven food access.
Because food banks expect increased demand in Connecticut, I think the state can consider a larger funding program until federal funds resume to expand distribution sites, increase mobile pantries, and partner with local stores to accept emergency vouchers. In fact, Governor Ned Lamont has already called a special legislative session to decide whether Connecticut will fill the gaps for SNAP recipients, proposing to use up to $500 million in reserve funds to ensure families continue receiving food assistance through the federal shutdown. 
However, Connecticut’s leaders should also take action on the federal level. While state efforts are essential to support residents during challenging times, it’s equally important for these leaders to use their platform to advocate for national change. They should push for the federal government to resume funding for food assistance programs, establish contingency plans to prevent future shutdown disruptions, and ensure that vital programs like SNAP remain protected for those who rely on them most.
Governor Lamont’s plan to hold a special legislative session and potentially use reserve funds shows that the state leaders recognize the urgency of this crisis. However, even before calling this session, he had already taken an initial step by allocating $3 million in emergency state funding to the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare to bolster food-pantries across the state. 
While this is a meaningful gesture, this isn’t enough compared to what other state governors are offering. For instance, in Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin immediately declared a state of emergency in late October by launching the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance (VENA) to ensure food benefits would continue for residents suffering from the shutdown of federal support for programs like SNAP. This will allow the state to issue $37.5 million a week from the state surplus via existing EBT cards.
This government shutdown is no longer a political event. It is directly threatening the well-being of families like mine and many others who rely on these benefits for daily nourishment. Food is a basic necessity, it shouldn’t be a privilege.

In August, ICE agents stormed a Stamford courthouse restroom to detain two immigrants who had come to court as victims of an armed robbery. At the same time, ICE detained 65 people, of whom less than half had any criminal charges or convictions, in the courthouse in Danbury. 
If members of the public cannot safely participate in legal proceedings, our access to justice is impaired. Recent new rules may help to limit disruptive and dangerous law enforcement actions in courthouses, but they do not go far enough to address the scope of the problem.
On September 16, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins announced a new policy responding to disruptive efforts by ICE agents to detain people in Connecticut’s courthouses. The policy prohibits arrests in courthouses “except pursuant to a judicial warrant or order issued or signed by a judicial officer,” and prohibits law enforcement personnel from wearing masks. Although framed as applying to “law enforcement,” both provisions effectively limit ICE arrests in courthouses. ICE agents frequently rely on non-judicial “administrative” warrants to justify arrests, and are the only law enforcement agents – state or federal – to wear masks in the ordinary course of business.
Although the regulation responds to a seemingly new problem, it is grounded in a long history of English and American law. The policy of barring arrests on courthouse grounds was upheld in British courts in 18th century, and was endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 19th and early 20th century. Decisions prohibiting such arrests are rooted in a strong public interest in having people attend court proceedings, and in allowing courts to conduct their business without disruption.
At a time when there is a great deal of talk about immigrants “following the rules,” ICE activity at or in the vicinity of courthouses tells people that these are not safe places, even when the rules may require they appear in court. In addition to the obvious example of criminal defendants not attending trials – even when those trials may establish their innocence – the fear that keeps people out of courthouses means the absence of women bringing claims of domestic violence, of tenants challenging evictions, of plaintiffs seeking relief for injuries, and the unavailability of witnesses in all manner of proceedings.
A recent Supreme Court decision seemingly permits ICE to use racially-driven criteria like skin color and spoken language to determine if there is “reasonable cause” to believe someone is a non-citizen. As a result, ICE now freely stops and detains anyone who agents believe “looks like” someone who was not born in the U.S., whether the person is undocumented, has a green card, is seeking asylum – or turns out to be a U.S. citizen.
There are, however, practical steps that the legislature in special session can take to address these problems:

Strengthen the current language regarding judicial warrants. Require that such warrants be inspected by a judge before law enforcement can be admitted to a courthouse.


Increase use of remote proceedings. During the Covid-19 pandemic, people also had real reasons to fear going to court. Often the problem was solved by conducting hearings and even trials using remote videoconferencing. Courts need to make it easy for any litigant or their legal counsel to request remote proceedings.


Expand the mask ban and the warrant requirement. The new masking regulations announced by Chief Justice Mullins apply only “inside a courthouse,” but in Danbury people were accosted on the grounds of the courthouse and even inside the adjacent parking lot as they were coming and going from the courthouse. Especially in light of recent cases of ICE impersonators relying on masks to engage in criminal activities, state marshals should require that no one on courthouse grounds may wear a mask, and that warrants not be served on courthouse grounds unless or until inspected by a judge.


Ensure there is a mechanism for enforcement. When Chief Justice Mullins announced the new rules, he conceded that state marshals or other courthouse security personnel would not be able to prevent ICE agents that chose to ignore the new rules. While the question of state officers limiting the action of federal law enforcement in this very limited context is up for debate, there must be accountability. A measure adopted by the State of New York requires that court personnel make a report each time law enforcement conducts an arrest in the courthouse. Making such reports public and ensuring that ICE higher ups, the media, and the community aware of ICE agents’ activities is the first step toward accountability.

Connecticut’s lawmakers must recognize that barring arrests in courthouses has a long legal precedent. The proposed reforms would merely effectuate those precedents at a time when some federal law enforcement are determined to ignore them.

Julie Bonney is a longtime, Kodiak Island-based representative of some of Alaska’s trawlers — a type of fishing boat that’s drawn increasing criticism over the years for accidental “bycatch” of salmon, halibut and other species. Last week, Bonney was returning from a trip off the island when Alaska state troopers seized her mobile phone and work laptop. The day before, investigators searched the offices of Bonney’s member-based business, the Alaska Groundfish Data Bank, and  seized all of its electronics.Bonney was not arrested and no charges have been filed. But troopers, over the weekend, confirmed an active investigation into allegations that “multiple seafood processors” had been illegally profiting from salmon and halibut bycatch — further fueling scrutiny of an industry that’s already under attack.
“I think everybody’s interested in what’s happening with trawl, essentially because of the hypocrisy,” said David Bayes, a longtime advocate and moderator of the 47,000-member “STOP Alaskan Trawler Bycatch” Facebook group, who flagged the investigation for reporters.
Everyday Alaskans, Bayes noted, can be charged with wanton waste for leaving a single salmon on a riverbank, while trawlers operating in the North Pacific and Bering Sea are legally allowed tens of millions of pounds of accidental harvests each year. The trawlers are typically targeting whitefish like pollock, which is processed into fish pies, filets, fish sticks and fish paste for markets in Asia, Europe and the United States.
The troopers investigation appears to center on processors, not the trawl vessels, as the vessels don’t get paid for their bycatch when it’s dropped off at processors’ plants.
Federal management officials say that processors subsequently sending the trawl bycatch to a meal plant would conflict with a federal regulation barring the fish from being “sold, purchased, bartered, or traded.”
The Kodiak meal plant’s use of the bycatch, industry officials say, was not a secret: Bonney had testified publicly about it last month at a meeting of a federal management board, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.
At the meeting, Bonney said that Kodiak processors have been sending bycatch not fit for charitable donation to the meal plant for more than three decades, under guidance from federal managers that explicitly allows the practice.

She said the amount of bycatch processed at the meal plant is a very small share of the plant’s total volume, less than 1%. Last year’s cap on the number of king salmon that could be taken as bycatch by trawlers in the central Gulf of Alaska, the area fished by the Kodiak fleet, was 18,316, while the total salmon harvest that year exceeded 9.5 million fish.
Federal officials only notified industry in August that the practice was no longer allowed, Bonney said.
Bonney, reached by phone Monday, declined to comment. In a note to membersobtained by Northern Journal, a colleague at the Alaska Groundfish Data Bank said the business “does not have anything to hide.”
Paddy O’Donnell, the skipper of a Kodiak-based trawler, said that law enforcement officials were taking a heavy-handed approach that singles out trawlers when processors may also have allowed bycatch from other types of vessels to be turned into fish meal.
“It’s like cocaine wars — but it’s not. It’s such a minute amount,” he said. “It is an industry-wide issue, and it’s to do with the processors and the reporting mechanism.”
A troopers spokesman, Austin McDaniel, said in an emailed statement that the search of Bonney’s business involved allegations that “large volumes” of commercial bycatch including halibut and salmon “were unlawfully entered into commerce by multiple seafood processors.”
State law and federal regulations ban the sale or commercial use of bycatch “to protect sensitive species, ensure sustainable management of Alaska’s fisheries, and preserve fairness within the commercial fishing industry,” he added.
McDaniel declined to say whether the investigation centered on the processing of bycatch into fish meal.
But a copy of the four-page search warrant obtained by Northern Journal said that the troopers were looking for records related to bycatch, “fishmeal operations, or coordination with processors and regulators,” as well those “showing Ms. Bonney’s personal involvement in shaping, editing, or endorsing compliance positions later used by (processing companies) to justify commercial activity” involving bycatch.
The warrant said troopers were searching for evidence of the crime of a “scheme to defraud,” a felony. It’s the second major fisheries related investigation in Kodiak this year, after a prominent commercial salmon fisherman and local school board member, Duncan Fields, and multiple family members were charged with illegal permit transfers in April.
Officials with Kodiak’s major processing companies either declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The business that operates the Kodiak meal plant, Kodiak Fishmeal Co., declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation through an Anchorage-based attorney, Michelle Nesbett. Nesbett said in an email that the company is “aware of the investigation and is cooperating fully with authorities.”
Kodiak Fishmeal Co. does not appear in state corporate registries, though in the past, regulators have described it as being cooperatively owned by several fish processing plants on the island.
Industry representatives said the desire to dispose of the bycatch as fish meal stems from convenience, not profit motive, given the relatively low market value of meal — typically less than a dollar a pound at wholesale prices.
O’Donnell, the trawl skipper, said that while the investigation plays out, vessels are now hauling their bycatch away from processing plants and throwing it back in the open ocean. The trawlers are required to dump the bycatch at least three miles offshore, which O’Donnell described as a time-consuming and inconvenient process.
While anti-bycatch advocates have been using the troopers investigation as an opportunity to question trawlers’ fishing practices, O’Donnell noted that, under a federal program, his boat’s harvests, and those of nearly all of the other Kodiak-based trawlers, are continuously recorded by onboard cameras.
“We have accountability,” he said.
Bayes, the bycatch critic, said that the trawlers “don’t get any pity from me” for having to return their unintended harvests to the waters of the North Pacific — adding that he thinks the fish are better off decomposing in the ocean environment than sold as meal to distant markets.
“They’re supposed to be doing everything they can to avoid it in the first place,” he said.

Digital white hearts float above her head. (Photo provided)Kwanita Allen was just 4 years old when she left home and walked to the neighbor’s house with a plea: “Can you help me find my mommy? She always leaves us.” 
This is the memory that sticks strongest with her: “Ask me anytime, any day, I am always going to remember. I’m never going to forget it,” said Allen, 25. “The parental bond is not one that you want severed or tampered with, especially early when you’re developing.” 
That night sent her on a life path she describes as “back and forth” and filled with uncertainty, as social workers became a regular part of her life. 
And now, the longest-ever federal government shutdown has thrust her into even more uncertainty. Allen has a disability and gets federal food assistance to buy groceries while she goes to college and lives in a Louisville subsidized housing unit at Family Scholar House.   
Her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit — $23 a month — has also been frozen during the ongoing federal government shutdown. Even though it’s not much, losing that “simple dusting — a little trickle” of help sent her to food banks in search of meat and pantry staples she can use to feed herself. 
“I’m not gonna resort to anything undemure, lose my dignity,” Allen said. But accessing food during this shutdown as someone who lives in the middle of the city, much less nutritious food, is a constant challenge, she said. “The fresh stuff that you would want to eat and that’s good for your body is nowhere around me.” 
Much of Louisville’s ZIP codes are in food deserts, meaning full grocery stores aren’t accessible, limiting access to fresh and nutritious food for some.

Sarah Brady, the president of Family Scholar House Works, the parent organization  of Family Scholar House, said the majority of residents in the nonprofit’s Section 8 housing have SNAP benefits. When the government shut down, Family Scholar House preemptively stocked the shelves of its campus food pantry to better feed the immediate community. 
Using federal, state and organizational grants and donor funding, Family Scholar House is “very much an educational program with a housing component,” Brady said. 
“We know that more often than not it’s not actually going to school or doing the school work that stops someone,” she said. “It’s life that gets in the way. It’s unstable housing and child care and transportation and food insecurity and all the things, whether you’re dropping out to take care of a family member, or to get an extra job to be able to provide for your family — whatever that may look like for each individual situation.” 
Because of that, residents have advocates they meet regularly to coach them through school, budgeting their SNAP benefit, managing health. Residents also have opportunities to learn about financial literacy, home ownership, cooking and much more. 
“It’s really an intentional program with a lot of wraparound services to meet the needs, but to also help them really, truly, overcome barriers that they’ve experienced and work through trauma that they may have experienced, rather than just putting a band aid on it,” Brady said. 
Most residents — around 97% — have experienced some level of trauma, Brady said. 
‘I lived that life’  
The neighbor Allen walked to for help at age 4 called Child Protective Services and she left home that night to live with her father. 
Even though she stayed with family, social workers were now a regular part of her life as she navigated neglect at an early age.

“People came to talk to you with their suits and their briefcases and their papers,” she recalled. “And they’re flipping their pens and asking you questions about the current home you’re living in… trying to weigh: is the other parent better?” 
She took turns living with her parents and their partners. She worked to find herself, participaing in ROTC in high school and, at 19, she joined the Army but soon realized there was “an internal problem” with her body. During basic training, she learned she had pinched nerves, sciatica and scoliosis when trying to run and do pushups through immense pain. 
She was eventually discharged over the disabilities and had to come up with a new plan for life.  
“It’s hard to know what you’re successful at, know what you can achieve, when all your whole life’s been back and forth,” Allen said. “You see others’ stability, and then you better have stability.” 
Allen is now studying at the Jefferson Community and Technical College in Louisville with hopes of being a human resources professional. She’s also a part-time advocate for foster-involved youth through several organizations because, she said, she wants people who grew up as  part of the child protective system “to know they’re not alone.” 
“I lived that life for real,” Allen said. “I fit those shoes at one time.” 
‘These benefits do help’ 
Once the government reopens, people could still see delays in getting food assistance: The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed a freeze on SNAP to continue. 
Even when the government shutdown ends, Allen said, there is work to do to end the stigma of getting food assistance and other help: “Defying the stigma of ‘we’re using this to be lazy and not work,’” she said. 
“These benefits do help people,” she said. “I didn’t just throw the food away. I didn’t just look at it. I made food with that — that is how I ate for the night. That’s important. Food is a pivotal thing.” 
There is “some stigma” still around needing public assistance, Brady with Family Scholar House said, but programs like hers are “a stepping stone” to a productive future. 
“Our graduates are buying homes; they’re doctors of nursing practice; they’re lawyers; they’re all of these different things, and they have to have help doing it,” she said. “So many of our participants are in a generational cycle of poverty and really being able to kind of have that courage to be the one that’s going to step up and break that cycle for your family is very hard.” 
Family Scholar House has five residential campuses providing housing for 279 families; 32 of its residents are young adults who have aged out of the foster care system. 
“Those people are all trying to do the right thing,” Brady said. “They’re all enrolled in some sort of postsecondary education or working or doing both, and they are just doing everything they can to survive and break that cycle for their family.”

You can read more about the section here.

There’s a tone many of us recognize in our bones. Not outrage. Not apathy. It’s that faded, sepia-toned feeling – the sense of standing just offstage while the rest of the country barrels past in red or blue. You care, but you don’t quite belong.
That’s where millions of Americans live. Nearly 80 million eligible adults didn’t vote in the last presidential election. These aren’t people who don’t care. Many simply don’t feel spoken for by either party or the culture at large.
What we hear again and again, here in Mississippi and beyond, is this: Most people genuinely want what’s best. They just disagree – sometimes fiercely – on what that looks like.
Philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre warned decades ago that our moral arguments have grown hollow because we’ve lost the shared frameworks that once gave them meaning. Words like freedom and justice still circulate, but we no longer agree on what they mean.

Psychologist Jonathan Haidt explains why: People weigh values differently. One person hears “choice” and thinks freedom. Another hears “choice” and worries about fairness. Both are moral positions — just spoken in different languages.
You see it on the ground here. At a recent Leland City Council meeting, one group argued that a family shouldn’t live in a collapsing house without running water. Safety and liability demanded action. Another group insisted removing the family would cause deeper harm, because even a dangerous house was still shelter. Both sides were trying to do the right thing. They just couldn’t agree on what “right” looked like.
You see it at the Capitol in Jackson. The school-choice debate pits parents’ desire for options against public schools’ plea for resources. Both sides want opportunity for children. But one defines it as freedom to choose, the other as fairness in access.
And you see it in Washington, where Congress once again failed its central duty of passing a budget. For nearly half a century, lawmakers have rarely met that deadline. The American people are rightly frustrated. But underneath the dysfunction is the same issue – a translation failure between competing visions of “best.”
Have we built our fences so high – political, cultural, even literal – that we can no longer see the beauty on the other side?
Here in Mississippi, that question matters. We know how high the stakes are. One in four of our children grows up in poverty. Our ACT averages lag the nation. Yet we also know what’s possible. The “Mississippi Miracle” in early literacy showed the nation that bold investment, bipartisan policy and shared commitment can move the needle for kids.
We don’t need perfect agreement to do it again. But we do need recognition that our neighbors, even the ones we spar with, are usually trying to do the right thing. Moral humility – not certainty – may be the only way forward.
Mississippi has a chance to lead by example. That means demanding transparency and results in every school, whether public, private or charter. It means protecting both individual rights and community responsibilities. And it means refusing to let ideological corners dictate the fate of children who need every adult at the table.
We’re not enemies. We’re just holding different maps. And maybe, if we stop mistaking translation failure for moral failure, we’ll realize we’re all still steering toward what’s best.

Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican, speaking at a hearing in the House Education Policy and Administration Committee, which he chaired, Nov. 5, 2025. (Screenshot/New Hampshire General Court)Republican Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a longtime advocate for school choice and the chairman of the Education Policy and Administration Committee, has resigned from the New Hampshire House, according to the clerk’s office.
Cordelli, of Tuftonboro, was included in an updated list posted by House Clerk Paul Smith Wednesday that names representatives who have resigned or died since the November 2024 election.
The reason for his resignation was not immediately clear. 
Since becoming a representative in 2013, Cordelli has been a prolific sponsor of legislation to expand alternatives to public education. He was one of the earliest and loudest proponents of New Hampshire’s education freedom account program, which passed in 2021 after years of efforts by Cordelli to get support from then-Gov. Chris Sununu and fellow Republican lawmakers.
He was the face of many efforts to impose tighter state control over the content taught at public schools. That included bills to give parents greater power to challenge books and materials deemed obscene.
And Cordelli had appeared to be leading many of those efforts into the 2026 session. Earlier this month, he pushed forward an amendment intended to revive a bill vetoed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte that would allow for easier removal of books from schools.
He was also the prime author of legislation presented last week that would allow the State Board of Education to take control of school districts determined to be in a financial crisis or to be violating state rules. Presenting the bill last week, Cordelli cited the ongoing fiscal crisis in the Claremont School District as the impetus for that legislation, which would allow the board to appoint an administrator to take over a school district for up to a year.
Frequently sporting a yellow scarf to symbolize the school choice movement, Cordelli was a regular presence on the House floor in support of education freedom accounts, charter schools, and homeschooled students.
Speaking in favor of a bill to expand the education freedom account program in February 2024, Cordelli encapsulated that lifelong view. 
“School choice programs have the best form of accountability,” he said. “Parents can walk when they’re not happy with their kids’ education. In public schools, what happens if the school is failing? They get more money.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Glenn-Cordelli-1024x534.png,,,2025-11-12 12:01:17.757759

The Tennessee Department of Human Services said in a news release that SNAP recipients who were expected to receive their payment during the first 12 days of November would receive that partial payment Wednesday. 
Recipients who receive their payments later in the month will also receive 65% of their benefit. The department news release said if they are directed to provide the full payment at a later date officials will. 
As the federal government shutdown dragged into November, President Donald Trump’s administration decided to withhold all SNAP payments. The program to help feed the state’s poorest residents covers about 700,000 Tennesseans and costs $145 million a month. 
The SNAP funding freeze led to a surge in demand for local food banks and impacted residents all across the state. 
On Sunday, the U.S. Senate passed a funding bill that is expected to end the 54-day government shutdown. The U.S. House will take up the funding bill Wednesday.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)A provision in the federal government’s shutdown-ending spending package would be a massive setback to Minnesota’s hemp-derived THC industry if it were to pass.
Although the federal government isn’t likely to start kicking down doors seizing low-dose THC edibles and drinks, a new federal law against hemp-derived THC products would create new logistical hurdles for the burgeoning industry and could cripple what has become a $140 million retail segment that’s even found its way inside Target liquor stores.
The provision was championed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, who sparred with Sen. Rand Paul — his Kentucky GOP colleague — over the section that reverses the inadvertent legalization of hemp-derived THC in the 2018 Farm Bill.
In an effort to encourage more industrial hemp for commercial use, the 2018 Farm Bill took hemp off of the controlled-substance list and defined hemp to be any cannabis plant or product with 0.3% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the psychoactive drug from the plant.
Turns out, that’s enough to make products to get people high.
Along with a 2022 law from the Minnesota Legislature, the 2018 bill created a legal gray area for intoxicating hemp-derived THC products and paved the way for Minnesota’s THC beverage and edibles industry.
McConnell led the 2018 hemp effort and now wants to close the “loophole” that’s allowed for a hemp-derived THC industry to flourish as part of his agriculture policy legacy before retiring next year, Politico reported. The new prohibition introduces a cap of 0.4mg of THC per container, effectively banning intoxicating THC drinks and edibles, which, even at the lowest doses, have at least 2mg of THC.
A coalition of 39 attorneys general, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, wrote a letter to key members of Congress in which they urged a rollback of the 2018 law: “Clear direction from Congress is needed to shut down this industry before it metastasizes further into an even greater threat to public safety than it already is.”
The industry currently has little federal regulation, leading to states adopting a patchwork of laws on hemp-derived products. In 2022, Minnesota passed a bill permitting the manufacture, distribution and sale of 5mg drinks and edibles to adults over 21, making it the “leader in launching the THC beverage revolution,” said Jason Tarasek, a cannabis lawyer at Vicente LLP. Among other safety regulations, the products can’t be marketed to children, and Minnesota retailers must obtain a license to sell it.
Paul objected to McConnell’s outright hemp ban, calling it “the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I’ve seen in a long, long time.” Most senators sided with McConnell, however — on Monday, the U.S. Senate voted 76-24 to set aside Paul’s amendment to reverse the provision, passing the hemp ban provision, along with the rest of the government funding bill, to the House to vote on as soon as Wednesday.
The provision, if it passes, will go into effect in a year, giving suppliers a chance to sell off their product.
Hemp-derived THC products are sold in liquor stores, breweries and other retail shops, making them a popular choice for consumers who don’t want to buy on the black market or venture into dispensaries now selling recreational weed.
“People who would never rip a bong are more comfortable with the low dosage,” Tarasek said.
Steven Brown is the CEO of Nothing But Hemp, the largest low-dose THC hemp supplier in the state, according to the company’s website. Brown said that his customer base for his physical retail stores, who are mainly 55 years or older, “don’t want to step into a dispensary.”
“They want to walk in and have a normal retail experience, like going to a liquor store or going into a hemp shop,” Brown said.
The federal hemp ban, which reverts hemp to the same federal status as cannabis, would effectively shut down the industry if it passes and holds up over time. Even if the federal government largely left states alone when it comes to regulating hemp, as it does with cannabis currently, the ban would create problems that would make the hemp industry virtually unviable, business owners said.
The Minnesota low-dose hemp business would become more like its cousin the cannabis industry, which is legal in two dozen states but remains federally illegal, creating a raft of business complications.
For one, liquor stores and breweries that sell THC products would have to pay significantly higher taxes, thanks to a section in the federal tax code that forbids businesses from selling illegal substances and also getting tax deductions on their business expenses. They’d also be unable to work with credit card companies or many banks, limitations which have forced cannabis dispensaries to largely use cash.
“There will be a number of breweries that will close their doors,” said Bob Galligan of the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild.
Also, since hemp-derived THC comes from immature cannabis plants with more non-THC biomass, it’s less efficient to produce compared to cannabis. Federal legalization made hemp less of a headache to deal with compared to higher-potency weed, Galligan said, but a federal ban on hemp would reverse that calculation.
“The THC category we started two and a half years ago, it’s grown to be approaching 15% of our overall business,” said Jon Halper, owner of Top Ten Liquors, which Halper said is one of the top two hemp-derived THC retailers in Minnesota. Halper attributes Top Ten’s sales growth this year to those THC sales.
Halper said he would have to pull out of selling THC drinks and edibles if the ban goes through, and expects virtually all liquor stores to do the same.
“Most of the brands are going to go out of business because they’re not going to have places to sell,” Halper said. “The industry will just crumble overnight.”
Five alcohol trade organizations sent a letter echoing Ellison and the other 38 attorneys general, though a slew of alcohol wholesalers followed that letter with their own denouncing a prohibition, calling instead for federal regulation. For the most part, alcohol retailers and wholesalers support the hemp industry, but alcohol producers are more split, said Halper.
Ellison seemed unaware of the possibly industry-ending impact of federal prohibition.
“Even before Minnesota legalized cannabis, our state legalized the sale of certain edibles containing THC derived from hemp – as long as those edibles follow important consumer protection and quality-control standards,” Ellison said in a Substack post. “I support this law, and I am not seeking to restrict the sale of products that follow the law in any way.”
But a federal prohibition on hemp would indeed severely restrict the sale of hemp products that are legal in Minnesota, industry experts said.
They aren’t all doom-and-gloom yet, however, holding out for the possibility of a potent political backlash.
The provision “may incentivize reform because there’s a huge nationwide industry that this is going to kill,” Tarasek said. “When there’s that much money and that much consumer interest in these products, I just don’t think they’re going to go quietly.”
Brown added: “We’re still in the fight.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5588-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 12:01:17.757759

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)If South Dakota is awarded the $1 billion it’s seeking from a new federal rural health fund, half of that money will be used to modernize telehealth and data-sharing efforts.
All 50 states applied to the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes. 
According to KFF, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million, due largely to new work requirements in the federal law that will cause some people to lose coverage.
Half of the Rural Health Transformation Program — $25 billion — will be distributed equally to states with approved applications, regardless of each state’s proportion of rural hospitals or population. That means South Dakota will receive at least $500 million, if approved.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The remaining half will be allocated based on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. Applications will be approved by the end of the year.
A key component of South Dakota’s application is a $500 million health infrastructure modernization proposal, which would include creation of a “South Dakota Health Data Atlas.” It would allow health care systems throughout the state to access health data in one “single, accessible platform.” The atlas would address telecommunications needs, equipment, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity concerns.
“The Rural Data Atlas will enable outcome tracking at the community level, allowing providers and health departments to identify gaps, target interventions and measure impact,” the proposal said. 
The modernization effort, including grants for providers, would expand health providers’ use of electronic health records and telehealth platforms in the state.
About 77% of the state’s critical access hospitals are in eastern South Dakota, with western communities facing up to 120 miles one-way to reach care. Because of that, the application focuses heavily on regionalization, prevention, and technology and self-monitoring efforts.
In addition to the modernization effort, South Dakota’s application includes the following proposals.
Sustainability grants
$125 million to fund grants incentivizing South Dakota health care providers to explore regional assessments and partnerships to “strengthen coordination and sustainability.” Providers could also use the grants to improve professional and management services that could impact a facility’s bottom line.
Such partnerships will “drive sustainable improvements” and “allow hospitals and clinics to coordinate services, offer complementary care, and achieve measurable quality gains and strengthen financial stability,” the proposal said.
Emergency Medical Services regionalization
$64 million to incentivize the creation of regional emergency medical service hubs to reduce response times and offer professional development and improved technology. The state has already dedicated millions of dollars toward technology upgrades for emergency medical services, and issued a report on emergency medical service sustainability recommendations in recent years.
South Dakota officials hope funding for the effort will improve emergency response times and increase the emergency medical services workforce by 15% over the next two years.
New Medicaid payment model
$62.6 million to support a new Medicaid payment model that would provide more predictable revenue to health care systems, reward quality and allow facilities to maintain comprehensive services in rural areas of the state.
Recruit rural health professionals
$62.5 million to provide recruitment incentives, such as sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends, to remove barriers and make rural health care positions more competitive. The program would include five-year sign-on commitments for the incentives and expand apprenticeship programs. State officials hope to recruit 500 rural professionals by 2030.
Certified community behavioral health clinics
South Dakota does not have any certified community behavioral health clinics in the state, which provide mental health and substance use services to anyone who seeks them, regardless of insurance or their ability to pay. 
Using $56.4 million, the state would establish at least one health clinic in each of the state’s behavioral health regions to improve access to care statewide. The initiative would also establish one mobile crisis team and one crisis stabilization facility per region to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds.
Chronic disease management
$45 million to improve chronic disease management across the state. That would include funding rural health care providers, pharmacies and schools to implement chronic disease management and interventions. It would also include improving remote patient monitoring technology use, such as implementing a blood pressure monitoring program and management workshops throughout the state, and offering more resources and support to caregivers in the state.
Establish regional maternal and infant health hubs
$24 million to analyze maternal health gaps — service shortages, social services and supports, workforce needs, and regulatory and payment barriers — and then fund three health care entities to create regional maternal health hubs. The hubs would use a combination of telehealth and remote monitoring technologies in addition to in-person visits to address transportation and accessibility issues in rural and tribal areas of the state.
Create a health care training and resource hub
$4.7 million to provide physicians, nurses, community health workers, emergency medical service providers, doulas and other health care workers with online training and events. Some training would be specific to rural needs — including behavioral health, telehealth, chronic disease prevention, and maternal and child health.
Strengthen community health worker numbers
$3.5 million to support the growth of community health workers in the state’s health care system, including helping with Medicaid claims and creating Medicare billing pathways for the providers. South Dakota has 180 certified community health workers, who help patients navigate health care systems due to language or cultural barriers, and the state hopes to increase that to 300 by 2030.

Democrat Jordan Wood has switched from running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to instead vie for Democrat U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s now-open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
After Golden announced he would not be seeking reelection last week, Wood confirmed to Maine Morning Star on Wednesday that he will instead run in that election. Wood, a former congressional aide who spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., currently lives in Bristol, which is not located in the 2nd Congressional District he’s now running to represent. He grew up in CD2, in Lewiston and Gardiner. 
On the Democratic side, Wood joins Maine State Auditor Matt Dunlap, who had launched a primary bid against Golden before the representative left the race. Little-known Louis Sigel, a former secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, is also running. Former Gov. Paul LePage is expected to be the Republican nominee, with no others yet running in that primary.
As a candidate for Senate, Wood had been campaigning across the state pitching himself as the one to replace Collins, but he did not garner nearly as much attention as Graham Platner, the oyster farmer and military veteran who made a splashy campaign launch in August. Wood called for Platner to drop out after reporting revealed controversial comments he’d made on Reddit in the past and his now-covered tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol. 
Before returning to Maine in 2021, Wood had worked as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He co-founded and previously served as executive director of democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair administration and certification of elections. Wood also previously served as vice president of End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act.

The Tower Hill Hillers defeated the St. Mark’s Spartans, 3-0, November 10, to earn their third state championship title in the last four years. 
 
NEWARK — Tower Hill was a point away from earning its second consecutive state championship as the ball crossed over the net and onto the Hillers’ side of the court. Through the final moments of set three, Tower Hill seemed focused on getting the ball to the left side of its attack. The side where junior Sydney Fischer resided.  
The final play of the Hillers’ victory started with a pass from senior Lily Leung to setter Parker Lewicki who set up Fischer drifting from the far left toward the middle of the court. Fischer leaped and swung her right arm hitting the ball with a fury that resulted in her 15th and final kill of the game, along with a state championship trophy. 
Fischer scored three of the Hillers’ final five points in their 25-21 third set victory helping Tower Hill defeat St. Mark’s, 3-0, at the Bob Carpenter Center, Monday night.
“I just kind of like remember, like, this is what all the work’s for. This is what I’ve been working towards all season and it’s just like that adrenaline rush,” Fischer said postgame of her closing performance. “[It’s a] do it for your team kind of thing, like play for something bigger.”
Fischer and sophomore Cadence Davis were a dynamic duo on the outside pacing the team with 15 kills each in the championship match, but it was the play of the Hillers’ middles that provided the duo with significant support. The middle trio of Danielle Soleye, Kennedy Haskins and Madison Squire combined for 14 kills scoring points off quick tips at the middle of the net.  
“That’s what we talked about the whole time. We talked about support not just being words of support, but actions of support where, you know, we’re making good decisions,” Tower Hill head coach Michael Sachs said postgame. “Those things are huge, and I think because they look at it as supporting their teammates, I think they focus on it more and were really successful.” 
The Hillers were successful all season winning all but one regular season game. The lone loss was to Garnet Valley High School in Pennsylvania. Against in-state competition Tower Hill was undefeated. The team carried their strong regular season performance into the postseason sweeping every opponent they faced. 
The Spartans provided a strong challenge for the Hillers in the championship game never trailing by more than six points in any set. Sachs complimented the Spartans ability to execute their system and the abilities of the Spartans’ middles to attack their defense with tips.
“Their middles do a really nice job tipping,” said Sachs. “We were preparing for those tips and they still scored a lot with us on those tips, but that was a lot of what it was, was they just did their system well.”
Following the game, Sachs said the championship win was a fulfilling experience because of the players ability to step up and embrace new roles before and during the season. The ability for the team to come together was aided by veteran leaders like libero Lily Leung whose experience helped ease the transition for her younger teammates.
“I think that really being there for your team and like telling them that ‘Hey, I’ve been there too, everyone has been through that’ just really helps out and allows everyone to come together,” Leung said.
As for what she’ll remember from this championship season …

Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are exploring “enhanced security measures” at the state Capitol ahead of the next legislative session set for January.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, announced the latest effort in a Wednesday press release. Hansen said the move was prompted by “recent acts of political violence in nearby states and across the country” but listed no specific incidents motivating the decision.

Just this year, there have been multiple incidents of violence against state lawmakers across the U.S., including a fatal shooting of a Minnesota legislator, and a fire-bombing at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion.
“The state Capitol is the people’s house,” Hansen said in the release. “We are dedicated to ensuring that all Nebraskans can enjoy it safely and participate fully in our political process.”
Nebraska’s Capitol is secured by in-house security officers through the Nebraska State Patrol, as well as cameras throughout the building. Hansen did not specify what other measures the Legislature is interested in implementing.
Other government buildings in Nebraska, including courthouses and local government offices, use metal detectors and offer fewer public entrances compared to the Capitol.
Hansen said the Legislature has been working with Capitol security and the other two branches of Nebraska state government also housed in the Capitol to determine what additional security measures are warranted.
Those conversations are ongoing, he said.
Hansen’s press release did not specify the estimated cost of such security measures. Budget constraints are poised to be a large focus of the 2026 session, as lawmakers are tasked with filling a projected budget hole that currently stands at an estimated $451 million.
Although any building-wide security changes approved by lawmakers during the 2026 session would not be implemented until at least 2027, Hansen said, the Legislature may take independent steps to enhance the security of legislative proceedings before then.
Hansen said the public should be prepared for possible security-related changes to legislative procedures in the upcoming session, scheduled to begin Jan. 7.

Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, and his attorney, former Sen. Dick Harpootlian, talk about their legal challenge to a legislative pay raise that inadvertently also halted existing payments outside Harpootlian's Columbia office on Monday, June 9, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislators illegally gave themselves a pay raise this year, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in an order that strikes both their normal allowance and the hike.
Through a clause in the state budget, legislators would have received a raise of $18,000 annually through their so-called “in-district compensation,” which is meant to cover expenses outside of the Statehouse. The state Supreme Court paused those payments over the summer, before they began, as it considered the lawsuit.
Not only will legislators not get the raise, but they will take a pay cut, since the order strikes down the same budget clause that has given legislators $12,000 each year for in-district costs since 1994.
Justices question the meaning of ‘per diem’ in case over SC legislators raising own pay

“No matter how well-intentioned or long-overdue, the result of the 126th General Assembly’s increase in in-district compensation without either limiting language in the proviso or delaying implementation of the increase to the seating of the 127th General Assembly is to increase its own compensation, which our state constitution expressly prohibits,” the opinion reads.
All five justices signed onto the eight-page order.
The state constitution makes it clear that legislators can’t raise their own salary, justices wrote. Instead, any salary increase must go into effect after an election, in this case at least January 2027.
The constitution says nothing about reimbursements to cover official expenses. But the budget clause included nothing limiting how legislators could spend the funds, which are separate from the $10,400 annual salary legislators receive.
In passing the budget clause, senators argued they needed a raise to keep up with inflation causing other expenses to rise. Justices wrote that legislators have every right to increase the amount they can receive to reimburse official costs but added the clause didn’t do that.
“It cannot be denied that, over the past century, legislative service has evolved considerably from what it once was, essentially requiring year-round service both in and outside of the legislative session,” the opinion reads. “The increased demands of modern legislative service naturally could lead the General Assembly to appropriate a greater amount of public funds to reimburse legislators for official expenses incurred in carrying out their official duties.”
Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, filed the lawsuit soon after the legislative session ended. He was one of 44 Republicans to opt out of the raise.
“I think this shows that Sen. Climer showed tremendous courage in bringing this lawsuit and held his fellow legislators’ feet to the fire on this obviously illegal act,” his attorney and former Sen. Dick Harpootlian said.

(Photo by Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas turned in a 60-page application last week in hopes of receiving a share of  $50 billion in federal money designed to transform rural health. 
Nearly one-third of Kansans live in rural communities, and the state’s Rural Health Transformation Plan aims to improve health in those areas. 
Federal government officials originally touted the $50 billion as support for rural hospitals that are set to lose billions of dollars after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut Medicaid and other federal health spending. But the program evolved into a more general focus on rural health.
The Kansas plan was developed in two months after the federal government set a tight timeline for submissions to receive a portion of $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. 
Of that amount, $25 billion will be distributed evenly among the states selected and the remaining $25 billion will be allocated based on submitted plans, said Kate Sapra, deputy secretary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of Rural Health Transformation. The money will be paid out over five budget periods, from federal fiscal year 2026 through federal fiscal year 2030. 
Sapra spoke at a September meeting to the team Gov. Laura Kelly appointed to develop the Kansas application, called the Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance. The coalition of government, nonprofit and private organizations, including the Kansas Hospital Association, the Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas and the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments.
The Kansas plan focuses on improving health delivery systems, encouraging innovative care models and using innovative technologies, according to the 60-page application submitted last week.
Martie Ross, director of PYA Center for Rural Health Advancement, Overland Park, told the group at its October meeting that they had condensed a yearlong process into six weeks. 
“If I had a piece of advice for Congress, … I would have said please give us at least six months and some funds to develop this application so it’s truly reflective of state needs,” she said. “Instead we have a very short timeframe to submit the final application.” 
Ross outlined complexities of the application process and what would happen between the Nov. 5 deadline to turn it in and the federal government’s Dec. 31 deadline to award the dollars. She said the program is not a grant, but a cooperative agreement. 
“It is a negotiation between CMS and the state as to what will be within the transformation plan and what will come out,” she said. They “certainly appreciate CMS is balancing the demands of 50 applications. Our application does not stand alone on its merits. It always will stand in comparison to other applications.” 
 
The plan
In Kansas’ application, the coalition focused on the following priorities, outlined in a news release from Kelly: 

Expand prevention programs to reduce chronic disease rates, including increasing access to preventive screenings and behavioral health services.
Increase local access to primary care for rural Kansans
Build a sustainable rural health workforce to support greater access to primary care, dental and behavioral health providers and to ease health shortages. 
Increase to 100% the number of rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in accountable care relationships by 2031.
Use data and technology to help rural providers expand telehealth, remote monitoring and other technologies, as well as support data sharing and analysis of aggregated patient and outcome data.

Metrics are attached to each part of the plan and Ross said that if the state isn’t meeting its metrics at different points during the five-year process, CMS can withhold funds. That money would then be redistributed to states doing better, and Ross said it is important that Kansas tracks its progress well. 
The cost of collecting and tracking data is included in the administrative plan, she said. 
The proposal includes a breakdown of each of the main areas with specifics, such as embedding behavioral health providers into rural hospitals to provide services and expand access to PACE, a health care option for older Kansans who meet certain criteria. 
“At present, 34% of PACE-eligible Kansans (about 4,300 rural residents) do not have access to a PACE program,” the application said. “The state will partner with two successful PACE providers in the state to expand program availability in rural areas, one by expanding an existing program and another by establishing a new one.”
 
Political input
Kansas Republicans wanted to have input on the Rural Health Transformation Plan during a special session, but they were unable to get enough Republicans to sign a petition to hold the session. In a news release, House Speaker Dan Hawkins lamented the situation. 
“Whatever rural healthcare dollars that Santa Kelly gifts to her favored ‘children’ around the state won’t be able to be returned,” he said. “Those who refused to sign a petition played right into the Governor’s hands by giving her free rein without oversight on hundreds of millions of dollars. Sad.”
The main reason for the session was redistricting Kansas’ congressional districts, but several GOP lawmakers resisted the move.
The state’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, wrote a letter in support of the Kansas plan. Others signing on included U.S. representatives Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Sharice Davids. 
“Rural health care providers across Kansas recognize the urgent need for transformation,” the delegation wrote. “Yet, with many providers operating under persistent negative margins, they face significant barriers to making the critical investments necessary for regional collaboration, clinical integration, and modern technology solutions.”
The lawmakers said the Kansas plan will empower rural care providers and support initiatives to improve rural health.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P5162163-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

(Screenshot via campaign video)A Kentucky racehorse trainer has  joined the heated political race for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat, saying he’s not beholden to the Democratic Party or Republican President Donald Trump.
Dale Romans, a longtime Louisville trainer who has had numerous horses start the Kentucky Derby, announced his candidacy Wednesday morning. A press release from his campaign said he was joining the race “to stand up for working people across the state and fix the challenges facing our country like harmful tariffs and dangerous health care cuts – instead of waging exhausting partisan fights that get us nowhere and only divide the nation.” 
A campaign video from Romans focuses on his horse training experience and his relationship with his family. 
“I’ve been in Kentucky my entire life, and I think I know what Kentucky needs in Washington — an independent Democrat that can go to Washington, D.C., and vote for what’s right for the people of Kentucky,” Romans says in the video. 
Romans argues in the video that he would be someone not beholden to the Democratic Party and not a “puppet” for President Donald Trump, like a “Republican freshman senator would have to be.” 
Romans joins a crowded field of U.S. Senate candidates hoping to succeed longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who is not seeking reelection in 2026. Other Democrats who have announced campaigns include former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, former Secret Service agent Logan Forsythe, former CIA officer Joel Willett and Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson.

Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen prepare for a press conference following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images)I spend as little time as possible thinking about the game of politics, but the gambit was doomed from the beginning.
For the better part of a year, Democrats had been stumbling around in search of a hill to die on but couldn’t commit as a party. How do you pick just one thing to save from a democracy on fire? But by the end of September, they had firmly settled on the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits as a deserving place for their big stand. 
Millions would suffer, financially and bodily, without the health care subsidies, congressional Democrats argued, and so as costly as a government shutdown would be for the nation the Republicans had left them with no choice. This would be the GOP’s government shutdown, not theirs, they said. But the truth is that it was always the Democrats’ shutdown, which became clear this week when it took just eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus — including New Hampshire’s own Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — to bring it to an end. And what did they come away with for their record-setting efforts, other than relief from the pain of the shutdown itself? A vow from Senate Republicans that there would be a December vote on extending the tax credits.
In a statement Sunday far more defiant than contrite, Hassan said, “Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts for health insurance.” Meanwhile, a clear-eyed Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said, “Even if it got 100 votes in the Senate, it’s not going to go anywhere in the House and the president certainly would not sign it.”
Only one of those statements is delusional, and yet it’s the one that carried the day. The Charlie Brown-ing of the Democratic Party continues.
The aftermath of Democrats’ “never mind” moment, meanwhile, has been equally predictable: Shaheen, Hassan, and the rest of the sacrificial octet have hit the airwaves to tell their side of things and offer political cover to any and all who desire it. With a wink and nod, friends, family, and colleagues have been invited to publicly feel all of their feelings of disappointment, but only in an “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here” kind of way.
If that sounds cynical, I really don’t mean to. That’s the game within the game, and always has been. The problem for Democrats is that they’re the only ones still playing.
The most important and fundamental question a society can ask itself is, “What do we owe to each other?” Traditionally, the Republican response has been “nothing” — especially when it comes to civil rights, economic equality, and a social safety net — while the Democratic role has been to clamor for some flavor of “everything.” The idea, at least theoretically, was that policy could never land on “nothing” or “everything” but rather in some amorphous middle that reflected both the ruling party’s power in the moment and the public’s appetite (or lack thereof) for progress. 
Republicans didn’t really mean we owe each other nothing any more than Democrats believed we owe each other everything, and those performances helped create the illusion of stability in the center.
But now when congressional Republicans answer “nothing,” that’s precisely what they mean. No harbor, no help, no empathy, no truth. By all appearances, Democrats seem to be waiting in vain for a return to rules they recognize — and a counteroffer that isn’t coming.
That’s why the gambit was doomed from the jump. Did Democrats really believe that Republicans in the era of Donald Trump, who above all want a government so small that it’s functionally non-existent, would fold during a soft launch of their ultimate fantasy?
On the other hand, if Democrats knew Republicans wouldn’t fold, 40-plus days of pain seems like an awfully steep price to pay just for increased public awareness of how bad things will get due to the expiring tax credits. Especially when the party of “nothing means nothing” has a thousand more manufactured crises waiting in the queue to help a reeling electorate forget the details of their broad misery.
Shaheen said she took her stand for the people and ended it for the same, applying the highest principle of public service to both her defiance and her capitulation. But in the end, nobody was served. We don’t ask our leaders to take us to the fringes of discomfort and suffering only to retreat. We ask them to lead us up to and through the pain, and only after they have clearly explained the purpose and likely cost of the full sacrifice.
Nobody thinks it’s easy to be a Democrat in Washington these days, and I wouldn’t dream of criticizing a politician for choosing empathy in this cruel age. But the only thing you accomplish with a half-hearted and ultimately empty stand is the dissipation of hope, in all its modern scarcity.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shaheenhassan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Wes Moore (D) is is setting up a campaign slate to back Democratic candidates — potentially primary challengers to incumbent lawmakers — who will support his agenda in Annapolis.  (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s Democratic governor is looking for a few Moore lawmakers.
Wes Moore, the first-term Democratic governor, announced Wednesday the creation of the “Leave No One Behind” slate. The campaign committee will be focused on backing the governor’s agenda.
“Today we take the first step toward creating a well-funded, well-organized effort to ensure we are electing leaders up and down the ballot dedicated to creating a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said in a statement. “Together we will create a team I am eager to help elect and work with to carry out the mission we came here to do: make this Maryland’s decade.”
Moore’s press release described the slate as an “initiative geared toward electing leaders up and down the ballot in Maryland’s 2026 Democratic primary and general election cycle.”
Such a campaign slate could be used to back challengers to incumbent Democrats.
It is unclear which races the campaign might focus on.
“After a resounding 2022 victory, the Moore-Miller Campaign knows 2026 is more important than ever and is preparing to invest and organize the best legislative slate possible to ensure victory in November and beyond. In the coming months, the Moore-Miller Campaign will announce endorsements and investments in key primary and general election races across Maryland,” according to the Moore campaign statement.

Moore has suffered a number of policy initiative setbacks, including a nuclear power bill that failed to advance in the Democrat-controlled legislature. He also struggled to get lawmakers to make changes to an increasingly expensive K-12 education reform plan known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
The governor also saw lawmakers pare down what he considered an ambitious housing and jobs bill in the last legislative session, when his demand for a bill allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores was rebuffed. The bill, sponsored by lawmakers, was not officially part of his legislative agenda, but he gave his support to the legislation, with didn’t get out of committee in the House or Senate.
Additionally, after Moore vetoed legislation this year to create a reparations study commission — a body Moore called redundant — a number of Democratic lawmakers were vocal about their desire to override his veto.
The announcement of the slate also comes as Moore is pushing for the possible redrawing of the state’s eight congressional districts. It faces a tough fight in the Senate, where a majority of Democrats, led by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), oppose the midcycle redistricting. Moore would need to convince 24 of the the 34 Democrats in the chamber to break with Ferguson for redistricting to have any hope.
Moore’s efforts are not unique. Other executives have used their position to target legislators.
In 2018, at a time when Gov. Larry Hogan was seeking re-election and an expansion of Republican seats in the Senate, he endorsed the primary opponent of Sen. Steve Waugh, a first-term Southern Maryland Republican who voted to override one of Hogan’s vetoes. Waugh’s vote was unnecessary given the super-majority Democrats enjoyed in the Senate.
Hogan was successful in replacing Waugh with current Sen. Jack Bailey.
Similarly, Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening was known to speak with legislators about issues in his office where they might coincidentally spy maps showing redistricted versions of their districts, some incarnations more advantageous to the legislator than others. But Glendening also had the advantage of being a lame duck in the final months of his term.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4303-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Tasha Gallup knew college could change her future—but her family didn’t think it was possible. With guidance and determination, Tasha found a path to college and specialized in sports medicine. Building the career of her dreams, she ultimately became a physician assistant.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Turning “We can’t afford that” into “I did it”: Tas[...]","Tasha Gallup and colleague Dr. Chris Vorys covering a Plymouth State University hockey game.
Tasha Gallup says that in high school, she was athletic, hardworking, and constantly thinking about what came next. She always knew that college would be the thing that would change her future for the better. “I had enough awareness to see that as hard as my parents worked, they were struggling,” she recalled. “I saw differences in families. I knew I was going to have to do something to earn my own successes. I realized that college was probably going to be the thing that helped me build the skills and knowledge to have a life where I could provide for and sustain myself.”
“If I set my mind to something, that was the hill I was going to die on.”
Sports were a big part of Tasha’s life at Spaulding High School. She played lacrosse for four years and was named a Vermont Senior All-Star when she graduated in 2000. That connection kindled her interest in a career that involved athletics. “I was always interested in sports medicine,” she said. “I thought athletic training was interesting, and I wanted to blend athletics with academics. I didn’t think I had the chops for med school, but I wanted to do something in that direction.” She was determined to figure out how to make it happen.
“We Can’t Afford That”
When she first told her mother she wanted to go to college, the response was painful. “She said, ‘We can’t afford that. It’s not going to work.’ I was dashed but I was heated. I wanted to do it, so I was going to do it.”
Tasha met with Clark Amadon, a counselor working in VSAC’s Talent Search program at the time. Clark began helping her figure out what might be possible. “I told Clark the truth. I said my parents couldn’t afford it. I was ready for him to say goodbye. Instead, he said, ‘Okay, if your parents can’t do this, there are other options. There are steps along the way.’ And I started to see it could be attainable.”
She remembers that first meeting at their kitchen table in Graniteville like it was yesterday. “Clark came to our house. He’s a tall man and there wasn’t a lot of space in our duplex…I remember him sitting at the table, and he had a laptop to help us with the documents and FAFSA. It was 1998 and laptops weren’t an everyday thing. My parents were nervous but gracious and they accepted the support and were willing to hear him out.” 
With Clark’s guidance, Tasha began to see all that might be possible for her.
Making it to Castleton
Tasha applied and was accepted to several Vermont schools. She eventually selected Castleton State College (now Vermont State University Castleton). 
When her financial aid package arrived, she was excited and apprehensive. She remembers, “it was so exciting to see that financial aid package. It felt like a true success when I had the realization that my goal of getting to college, being there, was going to happen.” 
She also recalls what it felt like to sign that first promissory note. “I took it so seriously when I signed that note. That meant a lot. My mom was nervous. She said, ‘This is for real. You have money on the line. If you’re going to do this, do this.’ I was committed. I had to get myself into a career field that could substantiate the obligation of what that loan meant.”
Learning beyond the classroom 
Tasha says that there’s no doubt, college was difficult. “I knew I wasn’t a star student. I was working hard but I was still so average. I remember my first paper in college—I got an F. I didn’t have the grammar skills I needed for success in college. I sat down with my professor because I knew I had to take responsibility for it. She showed me why the errors were errors. She said, ‘This is a comma splice.’ I said, ‘a what?’ She explained it. I knew that I had to work at it.”
Tasha began to set up structure in her days and week, and strong boundaries to make sure she had time to study, go to the library, participate in study groups, and meet with her professors when she needed help. Slowly, it started to pay off. 
In her junior year of school, her parents divorced. “Things were stressful and I needed to work more. I had four or five part-time jobs plus full-time school.” She ended up staying at Castleton for a fifth year in order to finish, taking a lighter course load those last few years to be able to balance work and school. 
“The dedication to the goal had never wavered,” she said. “I needed to take that extra time. I also knew that a bump didn’t mean the journey was over.”
Tasha proudly graduated with her Bachelor’s in Athletic Training in 2005. 
Building a career in sports medicine
After college, Tasha took on several jobs while saving up for the expense of taking her Athletic Trainer certification exam. “I worked at Dartmouth doing EKGs and exercise stress testing while studying and saving for my exam,” she said. She developed a mantra to help her stay grounded and focused: “The capability is mine to have. It’s the effort which I wish to put into it.”
After passing her exam, she spent the next seven years as an Athletic Trainer at a regional high school helping approximately 300 athletes across 26 varsity sports. Tasha notes that while it was a wonderful step in meeting her dream, she started to get the itch to go further. “I was seeing all these injuries and wanting to have more of a hand in the workup and diagnosis—I wanted to do more and be more involved in injury management.” Inspired to take the next step, Tasha decided to pursue a graduate degree that would enable her to become a Physician Assistant. 
A new chapter, despite an initial rejection
Tasha knew there were resources like VSAC that could help her. She paved the path to grad school and took the prerequisite classes she needed to apply to a Physician Assistant program while working full-time. “I burned the candle at both ends to get those credits covered,” she said.
But her first application to graduate school at Franklin Pierce University was denied. “I was so disappointed,” she remembers. She got on the waitlist the second time she applied, then got an unexpected phone call three weeks before classes started. “I got in, and I was so excited,” she remembers. But she had to move quickly to figure out financial aid, housing, and more. “I had put in the work to get this opportunity. I was not going to lose it.”
Tasha earned her Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies from Franklin Pierce University in 2017 and began working in orthopedic medicine. She got a job at a small hospital in New Hampshire as an orthopedic PA, splitting her time between surgery and seeing patients in the office. In addition to providing surgical and non-surgical orthopedic care to the patients of her community, she also stayed connected to her roots in sports medicine. Tasha worked with the Athletic Training Staff and was a part of the sports medicine team for the athletes of Plymouth State University, truly coming full circle in her dream of helping athletes manage injuries. 
Family, change, and perspective
Bristol, New Hampshire is home today for Tasha and her husband, Scott. Their nephews, ages 11 and 13, moved in with them last year. The change at home led to a change at work for Tasha. “I started practicing in family medicine, continuing with non-operative orthopedics. It has better family hours and I’m not on call,” she says.
She still misses parts of her earlier work. “I miss the rush of athletics and surgery where you are the calm and stabilization in the middle of a big storm. It was so rewarding. But when my nephews moved in, I was ready to move on.”
Looking back, she is clear that the help she got from VSAC mattered. “Clark helped me understand the steps I needed to take to secure financial aid. He came to the house, sat down with my parents, and helped us with the paperwork. Having that person who could explain it and believed I could do it—that changed everything.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)State and local law enforcement officials announced a breakthrough on a more than 25 year old cold case in Juneau this summer, thanks in part to a DNA analysis tool at the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Lab. 
Darryl Bruce Fawcett, an Alaska Native man, was 28 years old when he went missing in 1999. His remains were found by divers in the Gastineau Channel in 2004. In July, with the help of a tool that analyzes DNA from bones, officials said they were able to compare a sample with a family member’s DNA and identify Fawcett.

“It is pretty rare, especially (with) that amount of time to have passed,” said Juneau Deputy Chief Krag Campbell, in August. “So I’m just happy that the family was able to get some closure on this.”
The forensic method is not new, but the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory was able to adopt it with new federal grant funding, said crime lab chief David Kanaris. Forensic scientists are able to extract DNA from bones or teeth, which can be compared to DNA of a missing person or relative to make an identification. 
Previously, bone samples would be sent out-of-state for testing, usually to the University of North Texas, Kanaris said. The state may continue that practice as needed. “We saw real value in bringing on an ability to do most of the work here in Alaska, where we can,” he said. 
Cheryl Duda, a forensic scientist and DNA technical leader at the crime lab, said this forensic method is one of many that investigators use when unidentified remains are recovered. 
“For many years now, our laboratory has been able to do testing on a very wide variety of body tissues like blood, saliva, hair roots and skin cells, but all of those are very soft tissue types,” she said. “What is different about this technology that we’re bringing online is it’s a method to extract DNA from bones.”
Duda said that first, any unidentified remains reported to the state go through the Alaska State Medical Examiner’s Office, which determines first if they are human or animal. If deemed human, and a bone or tooth is recoverable, the agency will send a sample to the crime lab for analysis. The DNA is then entered into a national DNA database, the Combined DNA Index System, commonly called CODIS, where investigators can search for a match.
The database can compare the sample with samples of known missing persons, family members, or other samples that law enforcement has collected from crimes or that have been submitted by the public.   
“That’s the big first step for us, is generating this profile in the hopes of getting that match or that association in state, so that we can report those results,” Duda said. 
Jennifer Foster is a forensic scientist and supervisor at the crime lab, and said that the next step requires coordination across agencies. State employees work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that governs CODIS, other forensic labs, and local and state law enforcement departments conducting investigations. “So there’s a lot of communication,” she said. 
Officials at the crime lab say they’re working on a list of remains to be tested from the Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office, and cases are prioritized as they come into the lab. Once DNA samples are entered into the national database, the search continues. 
“So that profile routinely searches every night,” Duda said. “It does missing persons searches monthly. Relatives of missing person searches monthly. So as long as it doesn’t need to be removed for whatever reason, it stays in there and will search.”
Austin McDaniel, director of communications for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, said the state has analyzed three more cases since August, but no identifications have been made.
McDaniel said each case of unidentified remains is prioritized as it comes in through the Medical Examiner’s office, and investigators pursue and coordinate leads for identification. He said the new tool won’t necessarily unlock the state’s cold cases.
“If pulling DNA from bone fragments would have been helpful before, you know, either the crime lab or the medical examiner could have sent that out to other labs to have it completed. So I wouldn’t say there’s, like, this huge backlog of cases that just haven’t ever been worked,” he said.
There are currently 60 unidentified persons cases open in Alaska, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database, which goes back to 1968. The most recent unidentified remains on that list are bones found in a creek on Aug. 24 in Anchorage.
McDaniel said new DNA samples also get shared with the national database by the public through commercial at-home genetic testing, which can be shared with law enforcement. “That’s usually a box people can check, something like that might happen. Or maybe we go through and have family members reach out to us and offer familial DNA samples that can be compared against,” he said.
McDaniel said local law enforcement investigators can request the DNA analysis as they pursue leads. “An investigator from any number of agencies, not just the Troopers, as they’re trying to go through and maybe work on some of these cases they might go through to reach out to a family member proactively that they suspect might be related to the decedent, and see they can collect a voluntary sample from from them,” he said. 
Kanaris, as head of the crime lab, acknowledged these are sensitive cases, especially as Alaska grapples with a crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Alaska Native residents are disproportionately victims of violent crime. At least 27% of the 1,268 known cases on the state’s Missing Persons Clearinghouse database, managed by the Alaska Department of Public Safety, involve Alaska Native people. 
“We have worked with the tribal liaisons, understanding that a lot of these bones may come from Alaska Native remains,” Kanaris said. “And so we want to handle these samples as sensitively as we can and be as culturally aware as we can.”
He said another benefit of having this DNA analysis tool in the state’s crime lab, is handling cases more promptly. 
“They’re going to involve less transit time. The bones are going to stay in state, and they will, hopefully, be able to be returned to the families for closure as soon as possible. That would be one of the benefits of this,” he said. 
“I’d like to see us be able to work as many of the samples, not just with bones, but across the board, with forensic science samples in Alaska, at the Alaska crime lab,” he said. “So I think this is a big step forward for us.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC07250-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

After a rural California hospital shut down its maternity ward in 2022, pregnant women in Plumas County had to travel at least 70 miles to give birth. It was among dozens of California communities that lost labor and delivery services in the past decade. 
That may change by next year, though, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two new laws that seek to mitigate California’s maternity care deserts, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Because of rising costs, staffing issues and declining birth rates, Plumas District Hospital in Quincy closed its maternity ward three years ago. Since then, patients giving birth must travel for hours either north to Susanville; south to Truckee through winding mountain roads; or even farther east to Nevada, where the hospitals are larger.
But in October Newsom signed a bill to create a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals, including Plumas, to establish standby maternity units that operate only when needed instead of 24/7. He also signed another measure lifting some licensing requirements for birth centers to receive state approval. Typically run by midwives, birth centers accept low-risk pregnancies. At least 20 birth centers have closed in California over the last three years. 
Because of the new legislation, the hospital aims to open a standby maternity ward by next year. It also plans to open a birth center after facility leaders saw a growing demand for it: A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its maternity ward, according to the hospital’s director of business development.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with the hospital, said many of her current patients ask about when the birth center will open — evidence to her that the hospital’s maternity care plans are warranted because the community wants it. 

Link: “I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women.”

Let’s dive into some California environmental news:

Colorado River talks: California and six other Western states along the Colorado River faced a federal deadline Tuesday in their negotiations over how to portion water from the overtapped river. Despite two years of talks, the states remain deadlocked over how much they must scale back their water usage. Current river management guidelines expire in 2026, and federal officials have threatened to step in if states fail to reach an agreement. The federal administration under President Donald Trump has yet to specify what it might do if it needs to intervene. Read more from CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.


CA at climate conference: Gov. Newsom on Monday slammed the Trump administration’s absence at the United Nations’ climate conference in Brazil as “rather jaw dropping.” The governor, along with other state officials and legislators, led a delegation at the conference on behalf of California, symbolically standing in for the U.S. government. California officials say attending the conference is valuable because it helps build international relationships, informs policy and enables the state to join agreements with other regional governments. But critics argue California’s presence is performative and fails to represent local interests. Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde and Alejandro Lazo.




On the scene at UC Berkeley clash

The U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday that it is investigating UC Berkeley after protestors clashed outside a campus event held by Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that seeks to promote conservative values on college campuses. UC Berkeley was the organization’s final stop of its tour, as well as its first event at a California college campus since its co-founder, Charlie Kirk, was fatally shot in September.
Ella Carter-Klauschie and Chrissa Olson of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network were on the ground, reporting that while most of the speeches during the event focused on Kirk and criticizing the campus protests, demonstrators outside chanted “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F—k Charlie Kirk.” Students collided with police, who wore riot gear and held batons and projectile weapons, leading to at least four arrests.

Speaking of the UC: The UC’s 26-member Board of Regents sets policies for the UC system and all its campuses, including on tuition increases. But currently, only one of the two student positions on the board has voting power. Last year, one student regent voted in favor of raising nonresident tuition while the other student regent, who couldn’t vote, disagreed. The incident underscores arguments made by some at the UC Student Association, who say students cannot be represented by just one vote.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom may be playing a “climate warrior” at the U.N. climate talks, but in recent months he has tiptoed away from the decarbonization programs he had previously championed.
Legislators claim to speak for victims without ever asking them what they actually think — but a new University of San Francisco survey, which reflects the real concerns of victims, brings some hope for change, writes Jess Nichol, one of the sisters of the late Polly Klaas and an advocate with Californians for Safety and Justice.

A study will collect survivors' thoughts.","Guest Commentary written by

Jess Nichol 
Jess Nichol is one of the sisters of the late Polly Klaas and an advocate with Californians for Safety and Justice


When I was 12 years old, my sister, Polly Klaas, was kidnapped from our bedroom and murdered. In the aftermath, I watched lawmakers use grieving families — ours included — to sell the public on legislative policies that had already been written. 
Polly’s name became synonymous with fear. And California’s Three Strikes law swept through the legislature.
Here’s what legislators weren’t doing: asking what would help us heal, what would make us feel safer, or what kind of system we actually wanted. 
They were looking for pain they could weaponize. And it worked. Politicians simply assumed they knew what victims wanted, and they used our grief to push an agenda that had little to do with actual safety or healing.
I’ve spent years watching how survivor voices get co-opted — how our pain becomes a tool for policies that don’t serve us. Polly’s story became shorthand for “tough on crime,” and was used to justify mass incarceration, even though research shows victims overwhelmingly prefer rehabilitation and community investment over longer prison sentences. 
The gap between what we’re told victims want and what we actually need has felt impossible to close. That’s why I’m so moved by what’s happening right now in California.
For the first time, researchers at the University of San Francisco are surveying crime victims, survivors and their family members who have participated in parole hearings for someone who harmed them or their loved one. 
The survey asks simple but radical questions: What was your experience actually like? What did you need that you didn’t get? What would have helped?
This might not sound revolutionary, but it is. For generations, legislators have claimed to speak for victims while passing laws without ever asking us what we actually think. 
What would have made a difference
This survey flips that script. It was co-designed with victims and survivors over several months, ensuring that the questions reflect our real concerns — not what policymakers assume we care about. 
It asks about what support we received (or didn’t), how we were treated by the system, what resources would have made a difference and what reforms we believe would help others walking this difficult path.
It matters enormously that victims and survivors are leading this process, not as symbolic voices brought in after decisions are made, but as co-creators. 
The survey is open through November 30th. The findings will be shared with policymakers, advocates and community leaders to ensure victim and survivor voices guide future reforms. 
I know firsthand how rare this is. When Polly died in 1993, grief counselors and victim advocates would have helped our family immensely — but those services barely existed. 
Instead, we got media scrutiny and political theater. Her story was used to justify laws that primarily incarcerated people of color for low-level crimes — the very opposite of the justice and safety those laws promised. 
If someone had asked us what we needed then, we would have said, time to grieve, mental health support and a system that recognized us as victims in need of care, not props for a political agenda.
Our experience matters — not as a talking point — but as truth that can shape what comes next.
I’ve learned through my own healing journey that real change happens through connection, understanding, and genuine accountability — not through punishment, shame, or control. 
The same is true for policy. When we create laws based on what victims and survivors experience and need, rather than on fear or political calculation, we build systems that serve healing and safety instead of systems that perpetuate harm.
For so long, I’ve carried the weight of knowing that my sister’s story was used to build systems that don’t work — that harm communities, that don’t make us safer and that don’t reflect what victims actually need. 
This survey represents something different: a chance to build policy grounded in truth rather than fear, in healing rather than retribution, in the voices of those who’ve lived through violence rather than those who exploit it.
That feels like hope. And right now, we could all use a little more of that.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725-Polly-Klaas-NC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

Steven Horsford at the No Kings rally in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)The Senate resolution that reopens the federal government without extending health care subsidies, but allows some Republicans to sue the government over the Jan. 6 investigation, is “betrayal of a bill,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.  
Horsford, who spoke virtually Monday night to the NAACP Las Vegas chapter, said he wouldn’t support the resolution to reopen the government “as proposed and written” because it didn’t restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
The House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, is expected to reconvene Wednesday. 
The measure to end the longest government shutdown in American history doesn’t address the health care policy concerns raised by Democrats, Horsford said.
But it does add language that allows eight Republican senators who have their phone records seized during an investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who was looking into the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to sue the government for up to $500,000. 
Horsford expected the Republican-led House “to rush the process” to get the bill over the finish line before more people learn of the additional provisions. 
“More details about what’s in the bill and what’s not in the bill are going to become more evident,” he said. “People are already upset and pissed with what the Senate has done. When you really drill down on what’s in there and what’s not, that’s going to make more people say, ‘what are we doing?’”
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus Monday to vote for a continuing resolution to reopen the government through Jan. 30. 
Their votes have been criticized by a broad coalition of fellow Democratic lawmakers, progressive organizers, and even the centrist group Third Way. 
Cortez Masto, along with U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, had voted consistently with Senate Republicans on a continuing resolution from the beginning. 
Rosen had held out on voting on the resolution without a commitment from Republicans to extend health care subsidies. Less than two weeks into the shutdown, Rosen said to take Republicans at their word now when they say “‘trust me,’ when they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part.”
She relented on Monday.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
Without changes, Horsford said an estimated 28,000 people in Nevada lose their health insurance with “another 100,000 seeing their rates double to the point they can’t really afford it anymore.” 
“It’s not even a permanent funding bill and does nothing to address the Republican-caused health care crisis,” Horsford said of the resolution coming to the House. 
The resolution would only fund parts of the government through the end of January. 
Because of several additions to the bill, the measure has to go through a full House process. 
“We better be offered opportunities to bring amendments both in the rules committee and on the floor and to debate before the American people why we were able to move this bill but not something to address the health care crisis,” Horsford said.
The bill is likely to pass —  President Donald Trump, who wields enormous power over the House Republican majority, has praised the bill, saying “the deal is very good.” 
“I didn’t go to Congress to cut health care,” Horsford said. “Republicans control the House, the Senate, and White House. That means if they want to pass a bipartisan bill that cuts health care, that takes away food from needy families … they can do it without me.”
Horsford was joined at the NAACP event by state Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal, who said she was “mad as hell” about the agreement the faction of Senate Democrats reached with Republicans. 
Neal said federal workers she has heard from are puzzled about why the Democrats caved to pressure. 
“If they were going to give in, then they could have done that on day four,” Neal said, referencing frustration of federal workers, adding they believe “There was no reason for us to go 40 days without getting paid if you weren’t going to hold the line.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/horsfordNK-1024x663.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Hoover Dam photo: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)Nevada and six other Colorado River states failed to reach a broad agreement Tuesday on how to share the river’s dwindling water supply, missing a federally-imposed deadline after days of intense closed-door negotiations.
Despite missing the deadline, the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation indicated states would be given additional time to continue negotiations after making “collective progress.”
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” said a joint statement from the seven states, the Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – initially gave states until Nov. 11 to submit a preliminary agreement for a plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines set to expire at the end of 2026. 
The initial timeline also called for states to share a final consensus-based plan by mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer of 2026 with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum previously indicated that the federal government would intervene in the Colorado River water negotiations if the seven basin states couldn’t reach their own agreement.
The Department of the Interior did not respond to questions about a new deadline after states missed Tuesday’s or whether the agency would intervene.
Representatives from the Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — attempted to hammer out an agreement over a two-day meeting in Phoenix but could not reach a deal to manage the drought-stricken river.
In a joint statement the seven states and federal water managers said they “recognize the serious and ongoing challenges facing the Colorado River.”
Prolonged drought driven by climate change has put immense pressure on the overtapped Colorado River which sustains agriculture in the West and provides water for 40 million people across seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes and parts of northern Mexico. 
“Through continued cooperation and coordinated action, there is a shared commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of the Colorado River system,” the joint statement said.
‘Getting down to the wire,’ conservation groups try to pump up Colorado River negotiations

State negotiators for both the Upper and Lower Basin have said they would prefer a seven-state agreement than the alternative river management options proposed by the federal government last year.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he believes there is still a path to a seven-state consensus, despite states failure to meet the federal deadline Tuesday.
“While the Basin States did not finalize an agreement today on post-2026 Colorado River operations, our commitment to a state-led path remains,”  Cox said Tuesday afternoon on the social media site X.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
The Lower Basin – Nevada, Arizona, and California – want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under the current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts during shortages.
That disagreement prompted lawmakers in Arizona on Tuesday to call for stronger federal intervention in shaping post-2026 Colorado River operating guidelines. 
In a letter to Interior Secretary Burgum on Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and legislative leaders asked the federal government to include water supply reductions for Upper Basin states in any new guidelines they consider.
“This extreme negotiating posture – four of the seven Basin States refusing to participate in any sharing of water shortages – has led to a fundamental impasse that is preventing the successful development of a 7-State consensus plan for management of the Colorado River,” wrote Hobbs in the letter. 
Lower Basin states have offered to conserve 1.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water each year under post-2026 operating guidelines on the condition that Upper Basin states share cuts if further reductions are needed during dry years. Arizona would bear the brunt of those reductions. 
“The existing Colorado River operating guidelines are near expiration, and a meager runoff season has left the reservoirs depleted once again and one bad winter away from reaching critical lows,” reads the Arizona letter.
‘Rip off the Band Aid’
The Bureau of Reclamation will still need to go through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process so they can assess the environmental impact of the plan before issuing a final decision on new guidelines for the river’s management. 
The agency plans to release draft post-2026 operating guidelines in December detailing options for how to manage the Colorado River, followed by an open public comment period. 
After two years of state negotiations, some conservation groups also urged the Bureau of Reclamation to move on to the public NEPA process without a state consensus plan.
“Rip off the Band Aid, and let the public get to work. The states don’t deserve the kid-glove treatment any longer,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
John Weisheit, the conservation director of Living Rivers, echoed calls for the federal government to step up.
“It is clear that negotiators cannot hash out a meaningful management regime to deal with the dwindling reservoir levels that we will likely see in the coming years,” Weisheit said. “The federal government’s deference to the states has got to stop.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/53087352100_8c77cde5dc_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Courtesy of Lizzy Hayes)For 35 years, Charles and Linda Gill have run a family farm in Bowdoinham. While initially focused on cut flowers and herbs, they shifted to growing hemp after regulated production was legalized. The hemp-derived products they produce, such as topicals for muscle pain and gummies to assist with sleep, are each accompanied with a handwritten note from Linda when sold at farmers markets, wholesale or shipped across the country. 
“We are not in the business of these intoxicating hemp products on the market, which are the ones that are screwing it up for everybody,” Charles Gill said. “They’re abusing the system.” 
Charles Gill is referring to companies exploiting a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp production, which he thinks should be closed, as do many other hemp farmers in Maine. But they say the way the federal government has proposed to do so would not just prevent exploitation — it would decimate the industry. 
“All our current products would be banned,” Charles Gill said. “It would pretty much put us out of business.”
A provision tucked into the deal to reopen the federal government would drastically lower the allowable threshold for legal THC products. After passing the U.S. Senate on Monday, it now awaits the approval of the U.S. House of Representatives. White House officials have said President Donald Trump supports the language. 
Hemp provision in federal shutdown legislation would nullify Maine law

While hemp and marijuana both come from cannabis, hemp contains less THC, which is the compound that makes people high. Since the 2018 bill, it has been legal to sell hemp-derived THC products as long as they contain less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This made it possible to take legal amounts of THC from hemp and turn it into intoxicating substances — the loophole that there is growing pressure to address. 
The proposal in the pending appropriations bill would prohibit hemp products from having more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container and ban these products for “personal or household use.”  
According to a summary of the bill put together by the staff of Senate Appropriations Chair U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the language would prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.”
The new limits would also override Maine law, which limits THC to three milligrams per serving. 
There is widespread understanding in Maine, and across the country, that regulations are needed for intoxicating hemp products, which are frequently designed to mimic the design of popular snacks, candies and sodas, making them attractive to children. 
In contrast to cannabis products, hemp-derived THC products still remain largely unregulated, though earlier this year Maine passed a law that includes packaging requirements for intoxicating products that can now only be sold to people over the age of 21. 
Lizzy Hayes, an organic hemp farmer in Cornville who worked on that legislation, said, “that’s more common sense” than how the federal government could alternatively regulate these products.
Hayes, whose farm Panorama Seeds doesn’t produce hemp for intoxicating products, said under the proposed limits “that would mean that a whole package of CBD oil, which you wouldn’t be able to produce under these rules anyway, would never be an effective therapeutic dose.” 
Pointing to established and preliminary findings about CBD’s beneficial effects, Hayes said the passage of the federal changes would hurt Mainers who have come to rely on the products. 
Charles Gill similarly drew a distinction between intoxicating products and the type of products he sells. 
“If you ate a whole jar of vanilla extract, you’d get drunk too, but that’s not the intent,” he said. “My worry is that if they say that [essentially] no THC can be in CBD products, it becomes a very different product.” 
Nyeela Hueholt of Rooted Heart Remedies, a registered hemp farm in Buxton, said Congress should focus on how some companies are exploiting the current limits rather than the limits themselves. 
“The chemical processing to change a non-psychoactive constituent into a psychoactive constituent — that being illegal would be understandable,” Huebolt said. “But to put us all under this umbrella… to go back just because some people are abusing it, doesn’t make any sense.” 
As the federal government considers the provision, the state is also grappling with regulations on hemp, medical cannabis and recreational cannabis, the latter of which has greater restrictions and high taxes. 
In the state budget passed this year, the cannabis sales tax was increased — from 10% to 14% — a change that will take effect on January 1. 
When the Maine Legislature returns shortly after, lawmakers will again consider a proposal from last session that would add testing and tracking requirements for medical cannabis, which isn’t required to be tested for contaminants and potency like adult-use cannabis.

Technicians from different Utah, Arizona and federal offices inspected over 288,500 boats and performed 6,509 decontaminations of quagga mussels and other aquatic invasive species like Eurasian watermilfoil since the start of 2025, according to a release from the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

That’s an increase from the 6,383 boats decontaminated in 2024. But the state is overall happy with boaters’ compliance to keep invasive species from spreading in the state, said Lt. Bruce Johnson, from the Utah Department of Natural Resources Law Enforcement Aquatic Invasive Species Statewide Operations.
“We really appreciate everyone’s efforts,” Johnson said. “And while the boating season is winding down for the year, make sure to plan ahead for next year and be sure to take the mandatory education course, pay the required fees, and display the necessary decals on your watercraft, so you can be ready for another great boating season next year.” 
Currently, the only waterbody infested with quagga mussels in the state is Lake Powell, the division said in the release, however, contamination was also found in other waterbodies in Utah coming from infested reservoirs outside the state.
Idaho state officials say they haven’t found viable quagga mussels since latest treatment

The state highlighted that quagga mussels can have different negative impacts. They can plug water lines. If they get into water delivery systems, it can cost millions of dollars a year to remove and result in higher utility bills. They also remove plankton from the water, hurting fish species, damage boats’ engines and stink when they die in large numbers.
That’s why all boaters in the state are required to take a mussel awareness online course each year, and clean, drain and dry their boats before launching in other waters. Those with motorized watercrafts have to pay an enrollment fee, and get a decontamination certification if their last launch was outside the state or at a mussel-infested waterbody.
“During the winter season, there aren’t many available watercraft inspection staff at the stations across the state,” Johnson said. “So we ask boaters going to Lake Powell — or to neighboring states’ mussel-infested waterbodies — to please either have their watercraft decontaminated at that location before leaving, or to call us ahead of time if they are going to need a decontamination before their next launch.”

SB 23, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, would apply a special primary election to legislative and congressional districts if they are changed by the Legislature or a judge. 
Under the bill, any district affected by U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco’s order for new district lines would hold a special primary election before the end of August. There would be no special general election for the affected districts. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The primary election for the 2026 midterms is on May 19. Districts affected by the bill would only have their primaries in August. A message seeking comment was left with Gudger’s office on Tuesday. The Legislature begins its 2026 regular session on Jan. 13. 
Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively.
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the special master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
The special master recommended three maps, ranking two as what he thought was best. Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen objected to all three recommendations, with one being “the least bad of several bad options.”
“Each of the proposed plans was drawn with a racial target,” Allen wrote in an Oct. 31 court filing. 
Allen and other state Republican leaders have consistently said that the redistricting process is racial gerrymandering on principle. In August, GOP Chairman John Wahl said the litigation is “racist by nature.” 
The map that Allen said was the “least bad” is the same map the special master, Richard Allen, said was the weakest remedy to Manasco’s ruling. Manasco ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
“The special master puts forward Remedial Plan 3 because, while it weakly remedies the Section Two violation, the comparison of Remedial Plan 3 to Remedial Plans 1 and 2 demonstrates the impact of modifying a third district (District 30) on the effectiveness of the remedy,” the special master wrote in his October recommendation.
The plaintiffs in the case requested that Remedial Plan 2 be adopted, according to an Oct. 31 filing. The plaintiffs said that Remedial Plan 2 is unimpeachable of racial gerrymandering and is the best remedy to Manasco’s ruling. 
Deuel Ross, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Tuesday he had not reviewed Gudger’s legislation as of Tuesday afternoon.
“Plaintiffs object to Plan 3 both because only White candidates stand any chance of winning in Senate District 26 and because Black-preferred candidates (regardless of race) win less than 50% of the time,” the plaintiffs wrote in the filing. “Under Plan 3, Black candidates in SD26 won only three (23%) of the 13 analyzed elections and none of these wins occurred after 2018. Report at 19. Even including those wins, Black candidates lose by an average margin of over 7%.”
Should the U.S. Supreme Court rule for Louisiana in the Callais case, Alabama’s 2nd and 7th congressional districts — represented by Democratic U.S. reps. Shomari Figures of Mobile and Terri Sewell of Birmingham — could be placed in jeopardy. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling of a lower court panel, which included Manasco, that Alabama’s congressional maps denied Black voters a proper say in their governance, and ordered new ones drawn.

Remedial Plan 1 reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30.

Remedial Plan 3 extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25. 
Remedial Plan 3 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26.

Photo provided by Scott Greer.If you explore the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor, go upstairs, and find the Opera Room, you might see a quilt. It is a work by Toby Millman, a University of Michigan faculty member and alum, and was commissioned by the University of Michigan Arts Initiative. It is part of a larger exhibit called Visual History of the Unions.
The exhibit was supposed to open on October 16, with the various pieces displayed in high traffic areas on the ground floor. Instead, the quilt and most of the other artworks in the exhibition are in an obscure room that opened on Nov 6 for six weeks only.
Why?
Well, the title of the appliqué quilt is a tipoff: “Tahrir Coalition- March 28, 2024.” It shows a group of students gathered in the Union, with Palestinian flags, protesting the genocide being conducted in Gaza with the support of the US. It is unclear who made the decision to delay, relocate, and shorten the timeframe for the exhibition. It could have been a staff member in charge of the University of Michigan Unions, or some higher level administrator. But relocated it was.
The story of that quilt is telling. Regardless of what you think about Israel or international law or student activists, or appliqué quilt art, it is a story of obedience in advance by administrators. Of looking around for people who might stifle free speech at the U of M, and giving them what they want before they ask for it. And therefore of the moral collapse, in historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat’s words, that enables the loss of a democracy.
That’s an awfully heavy message to fold into a quilt, no?
Well, the quilt is only an issue because a university administrator decided to make it an issue. And, as likely as not, that decision was taken out of fear of outside forces.
The evidence is in a genuinely shocking new report. The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association just released their research on the weaponization of civil rights law to stifle speech and debate on campus.
It’s amazing. It documents a surge of civil rights investigations since 2023, overwhelmingly focused on speech rather than traditional civil rights complaints such as sexual or racial discrimination.

Discriminating-Against-Dissent_0 
These actions are in response to reports that make it clear that criticism of Israeli policy, rather than anti-semitism, is the focus: “All but one of the 102 antisemitism complaint letters we have analyzed focus on speech critical of Israel; of these, 79% contain allegations of antisemitism that simply describe criticisms of Israel or Zionism with no reference to Jews or Judaism; at least 50% of complaints consist solely of such criticism.”
It is legitimate to debate the relationship of Judaism and Zionism, but this is a bare-knuckle fight, not a debate about identity and ideology.
And, finally, efforts to chill campus discussion of the Middle East are part of a broader political agenda. The report finds that 78% of complaints were from right-wing advocacy organizations, including some with no campus presence, and at least 24% of investigations were opened based on complaints by actors with no connection to the school. In fact, at least 15 investigations were opened based on “complaints from a single conservative activist with no relation to any of the schools investigated!”
The fear on American college campuses is being driven from the outside. Outside agitators are at work all right, but they are overwhelmingly on the side of repression and coordination with the Trump administration.
Professor Jean Hong of the University of Michigan, at the annual Davis, Market and Nickerson lecture in honor of the fight for free speech at Michigan, spoke to the way fear works in a university. Discussing her experience as a professor in Hong Kong during the Chinese Communist crackdown on free speech there, a time when once free speakers rapidly learned the art of self-censorship, she noted that the university didn’t impose it. Outside forces in government and their allies in society did the work.
But unlike the people of Hong Kong, we do not face the full power of the People’s Republic of China. A conservative activist who files fifteen complaints is a far cry from the youth wing of the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to American democracy is a increasingly unpopular president with a thin electoral victory who has been repeatedly  repudiated by both the overwhelming majority of federal courts – and the voters who had elections this month.
Put another way, there are far more people who like American democracy than people who are willing to sacrifice it. If every little action taken by anti-democratic forces and those they cow is challenged, then over time they will be overwhelmed.
Americans often imagine that you lose your democracy when there are tanks in the streets and colonels in mirrored sunglasses taking over the TV studio. But democracies are more likely to die in subtler and superficially legal ways these days, as anti-democratic political forces take advantage of others’ weakness, careerism, and fear, and chip away at our rights.
Democracy, and a university, can die not in a coup, but one quilt at a time.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Families of Black homicide victims in the United States are more likely than any other group to seek financial assistance through state victim compensation programs — and they are the most likely to be denied, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Race and Justice.
Researchers analyzed nearly 60,000 homicide-related compensation claims filed in 18 states between 2015 and 2023. They found that nearly one-third of all the denials were based on “contributory misconduct,” a discretionary policy in which officials, often relying on police reports and assessments, can deny compensation if they judge that the victim’s behavior or alleged criminal involvement contributed to their death.
Families of Black victims submitted about 46% of all claims for compensation, but made up 57% of denials attributed to contributory misconduct. The researchers note that this may reflect subjective judgments and racial biases, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic or Latino families.
Even after controlling for gender, state and year of application, the researchers found that families of Black and American Indian victims had lower compensation approval rates — about 82% — compared with roughly 87% for white victims and nearly 91% for Asian victims. Families of male victims and those of younger victims aged 18 to 24 were also less likely to receive compensation.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

Victims of crime often face a maze of legal and administrative barriers, making it hard to secure compensation or other support.
State-based crime victim compensation programs are often at least partially funded by the federal 1984 Victims of Crime Act or VOCA, which uses federal criminal fines and forfeitures — not taxpayer dollars — to support victims of violent crime. These funds are allocated to states by Congress.
These programs provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by violent crimes, including homicide. Compensation can cover expenses such as counseling, funeral costs, emergency assistance and lost wages. But the amount of funding available to states has plummeted by billions of dollars in recent years. In response, some states have stepped in to fund crime victim programs with state dollars. 
In August, 21 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to tie victims’ compensation to its immigration agenda. The administration sought to withhold funds from states that refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice quietly released its state-by-state VOCA fund allocations for fiscal year 2025. Collectively, the states and Washington, D.C. received $1.25 billion in support.
The researchers warn that barriers to accessing support may worsen financial and emotional hardships for grieving families and reinforce broader inequalities. They call for changes such as limiting denials based on contributory misconduct, expanding administrative support for applicants and standardizing data collection across states to better monitor disparities.

New California laws are bringing maternity care closer to home,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/plumas-maternity-birth-center/,"Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.","In summary
Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.


At 3:30 on a July morning, Emily Meyers’ water broke. Her son was coming five weeks early. Meyers and her husband jumped in the car and raced from their home in Greenville, population 387, to Reno, Nev. where they had planned to deliver. It was a two-hour drive along mostly narrow, two-lane highways shared with logging trucks. 
They didn’t make it in time. Their son, Grant, was born in the car 13 minutes from the hospital to two stunned parents.
Along the way they had passed two other hospitals — Plumas District Hospital in Quincy and Eastern Plumas Health Care in Portola — neither of which have maternity wards. Meyers’ husband had asked if she wanted to stop at either one, but she told him to keep driving. 
“At that point I didn’t know how intense things were going to be,” Meyers said. “I didn’t feel like I could stop in the little towns if something was wrong.”
Meyers’ frantic experience exemplifies the challenges that have become commonplace for pregnant patients in rural California: Dozens of hospitals have stopped delivering babies across the state, leaving many families with no option other than to drive for hours and hope for the best.
But in the remote Sierra Nevada community where Meyers lives, hospital executives have a plan to change things. 
Plumas District Hospital, one of the hospitals Meyers sped past during labor, closed its maternity ward in 2022 after costs grew and birth rates declined. This year, it helped pass two state laws that give rural hospitals the ability to reimagine birth services. 
One of the laws, authored by Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, creates a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals such as Plumas District Hospital to create “standby” maternity units that operate only when needed, rather than offering standard 24/7 service. 
The unit must have the ability to do surgical deliveries, blood transfusions, resuscitation and life-support measures. The California Department of Public Health will monitor and evaluate safety outcomes with the new model.
A related law relaxes some of the licensing requirements for birth centers, which are typically run by midwives and accept low-risk pregnancies. 
“Expecting moms and their families in rural California deserve better,” said McGuire, a Democrat from Santa Rosa whose district stretches north to the Oregon border, in a statement to CalMatters.
Dr. Robert Moore, chief medical officer for Partnership HealthPlan, a health insurer that covers the state’s northernmost counties, said it’s not realistic for some rural hospitals to offer maternity care 24 hours a day. The numerous closures prove that. Emergency maternity services are better than none at all, he added.
“It’s not acceptable for someone to travel two hours to the nearest hospital. The outcomes are not worth it,” Moore said. “We owe it to the rural areas of the state to fix it.”
A new birth center for Plumas County 
Next year, as a result of the legislation, Plumas District Hospital plans to open a birth center and standby maternity ward. Women who qualify and do not want an epidural will be able to give birth locally. The hospital’s on-call obstetrics team will be available to take transfers from the birth center should any complications arise that require a doctor.
Darren Beatty, chief operating and government affairs officer for the hospital, said maternity care is part of what makes a rural community vibrant, and it’s why facility leadership pushed hard to change state law over the past few years.
“We’re experiencing multiple threats in and outside of health care to maintain(ing) a rural lifestyle,” Beatty said. “We need to do our part so that Quincy can be an outlier and not continue to shrink and go away like many rural communities have.”
Nearly 60 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services since 2012 in rural and urban areas alike, according to a CalMatters database. But in rural areas, when a hospital stops delivering babies, it is often the last option left to a community. The closest hospitals to Plumas with maternity wards are a 70-mile drive north to Susanville or south to Truckee through winding mountain roads. Many families, like the Meyers family, choose to go east to Nevada where the hospitals are farther but larger.
The Plumas District Hospital chose to open a birth center because families in the county want something different: Home births have trended upward since 2020. 
A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its labor and delivery ward, said Tiffany Leonhardt, director of business development.
“That was just really a huge eye opener to us,” Leonhardt said. “There’s so many women in our community who, number one, they want it, and number two, they actually qualify for it — it’s safe for them.”
Emily Meyers said if those resources had been in place three months ago, she would have elected to give birth locally at the birth center. She and her husband likely also would have stopped at the Plumas District Hospital emergency room in Quincy. 
“A birthing center that’s 30 minutes from my house — that would be a huge relief,” Meyers said. “It was very miserable to be in labor in the car for an hour and a half. It would be nice if there were a few more options for people, and it would give me more peace of mind knowing there was more care available.”
Rural hospitals struggle to maintain labor and delivery
In 2022, the last year that Plumas District Hospital operated a maternity ward, it delivered 64 babies, barely more than one per week. When the number of births drops below 200, that’s usually a sign of trouble, Moore, with Partnership Health Plan, said.
Low volume is a common problem in rural California and one that comes with a hefty price tag. Maternity wards are often the second most expensive hospital units to run after the emergency room because they require around-the-clock staffing, and without enough births there’s no revenue to cover the service.
Plumas’ hospital also struggled with staffing issues. As a rural hospital, it needed nurses who could work in multiple areas of the hospital when women weren’t in labor; modern training has encouraged most medical professionals to specialize in a single area. 
Open nursing positions with sign-on and housing bonuses would go months without applicants, hospital leaders said. Temporary traveling nurses hired to fill on the maternity ward were unwilling to work in other areas of the hospital.
“We couldn’t throw enough money at it,” Beatty said. “We were willing to spend whatever it took to get the staffing we needed, but that wasn’t the problem.” 
Still, hospital leaders vowed to bring some birth services back to the area after closing the maternity ward. 
Plumas District Hospital kept its 24-hour operating room open and retained anesthesiologists, obstetricians and respiratory therapists on staff. Typically, when a rural hospital ends labor and delivery, it stops related services; but doctors and midwives have continued prenatal care and follow-up with moms who deliver in other cities. 
“Obstetrics really forces an organization to be very, very excellent across the board,” Beatty said. 
Birth centers gain popularity
Emily Meyers’ sister-in-law, Mary Ann Meyers, remembers when Plumas District Hospital closed its maternity ward. She had been planning on delivering her first child there in 2021 when the Dixie Fire swept through the region, burning nearly 1 million acres. The hospital was spared, but she transferred her care to a hospital in Nevada instead because of the smoke. Months later, Plumas District Hospital shut the doors to its maternity ward.
That loss complicated the birth of her second child. Mary Ann drove five hours round trip between Greenville and Reno for those prenatal appointments. 
Then, the same July day that Emily gave birth, Mary Ann found herself in labor with her third child, speeding to the same hospital. Her water broke at 2:30 a.m. She and her husband drove to Reno and had just checked into a hotel when they got a call saying Emily had delivered in the car and was also in Reno – in the Sierra Medical Center emergency room.
Mary Ann started feeling stronger contractions herself, so she and her husband rushed over to Sierra Medical too. By the time she made it up four flights of stairs to the maternity ward, Mary Ann was 9 centimeters dilated and nearly ready to push.
“We made it but I am definitely worried about next time,” Mary Ann Meyers said. “It went from zero to 100 in 40 minutes.”
Moms in the area will be excited about the new birth center, Mary Ann said. Many of her friends want natural births. Though she delivered in a hospital, she did it without an epidural.
Planned out-of-hospital births in California increased by 30% over the past decade even as birth rates overall declined, according to data from the Medical Board of California.
“If there is an emergency it’s still a little risky, but it’s good to know that there are people who are capable and knowledgeable if you need help,” Mary Ann Myers said.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with Plumas District Hospital, said the plan is for obstetrics staff to routinely spend time at larger institutions, to keep up their skills. 
Link, too, is optimistic about the future of maternity care in Plumas. Many of her current patients ask about the birth center and when it will open. The plan wouldn’t be sustainable if the community didn’t want it, she said. 
“I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women,” Link said.

(Getty)The Alabama Public Charter School Commission (APCSC) received a nearly $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Executive Director Logan Searcy said Monday.
The Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant was awarded before the government shutdown and will be used to support charter schools through sub-grants. APCSC said on Facebook that Alabama was one of six states to receive the grant.
“We support both our traditional schools and our charter schools. But what’s important here is giving choice to parents for what best fits the needs of their students. So we’re looking at options and choices, and we’re looking forward to giving them those things,” Searcy said.
According to the U.S. Department of Education’s website, CSP funds may be used to create new charter schools; replicate existing ones or spread information about charter schools. The department’s website states that there are also additional funds that can be used by charter schools to find facilities, reward charter schools that form “exemplary” collaborations with traditional schools and invest in national initiatives that support charter schools.
The U.S. Department of Education said on its website that the CSP grants total $500 million, making them the biggest investment in the program’s history. 
Searcy told commissioners during the Monday work session that 23 subgrants will be given to charter schools. 
In Alabama, replication is the process an existing charter school goes through to establish another facility not on the current campus that replicates the vision, mission, grade level, academic program or instructional model. Expansion is defined as a charter school opening another school not on the campus or approved school area without replication, or when an existing school expands its program beyond the grade levels outlined in the school’s charter contract on the same campus or approved school area.
“We will have seven new charter schools. Those grants will be three years. That will mean a planning year, an implementation year and an operating year,” Searcy told commissioners. “We will have four replication charter schools over a two-year period of time. We also have four expansion school opportunities. Those grants will last over two years and we will have eight conversion charter schools over a two year period.”
Searcy said at the meeting APCSC will work with a third-party consultant annually to evaluate sub grantee applications, conduct peer reviews and review new charter school applications.
The grant will also be used to hire personnel to support the charter schools in Alabama including a project director, a community communications specialist, an assistant finance manager and four part time roles.
The federal government shutdown has halted the award process for the commission, Searcy said.
“The availability of the grant is determined by when the government goes back. At this point, we know that we have received our G5 [Technical Review Form], we will be able to draw down the money, we have worked with enough of the people that are not furloughed to know that we have gotten that underway. That was not an issue. We’re hoping that the government shutdown will cease soon so that we can get back to the timeline of our charter school grant,” Searcy said.
Searcy told commissioners the grant would help improve the existing charter schools and allow new ones to come into the state.
“We were all on board with making this grant work for our charter schools and for our future charter schools. No one wanted this grant for extra pay. We wanted this grant because it was the right thing for Alabama,” she said.
Amanda Inabinett, APCSC’s Alabama State Department of Education liaison, said at the meeting she’s glad the grant was secured and is anticipating the government’s reopening.
“We worked really hard for this grant, and I’m just so glad to see it come to fruition. I won’t lie, It was a little scary, it was a little intimidating, but I think that we’re ready for it, and we’re really ready to get all the folks on board with us. So we’re just all waiting for that moment when they say the government’s open back up,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

The move, some say, illustrates the cultural divide between urban and rural residents of the state.  
Commissioner Tommy Caviglia, who represents sportsmen on the nine-member Wildlife Commission, said at Saturday’s commission meeting in Washoe County that he opposed sanctioning the events, where the person who slaughters the most coyotes wins cash and prizes. 
Until now, coyote killing contests in Nevada have been unregulated – neither prohibited nor sanctioned by the state. Ranching and hunting enthusiasts contend that the wanton killing reduces the population, lessening the volume of coyotes preying on cattle and mule deer. 
But studies indicate populations are higher where coyotes are hunted because of a reproductive response triggered by decreased competition for food, resulting in larger litters born to younger mothers. 
The regulation passed Saturday requires that participants have a Nevada hunting or trapping permit, and establishes the season from Sept. 1 to March 31. 
“I do think it’s in poor taste. This is a polarizing subject. I don’t believe this language provides any benefit,” Cavigilia said, adding the controversy over killing contests is “U.S. wide. This issue is not going to go away. By defining it in a regulation, I believe we’re just pouring gasoline on the issue.”
Killing contests have been banned in most western states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. Nevada competitions are routinely organized and advertised in those states.
Efforts to regulate killing contests in Colorado and Washington failed, with both states banning the contests outright in 2020. 
The rules “are theater,” wildlife advocate Stephanie Myers said during public comment. “They make it look like the Commission is doing something, while, in reality, they do nothing to stop these brutal contests with sordid prizes.”
Former Republican State Sen. Warren Hardy, now a lobbyist representing Humane World for Animals, called the vote “an offensive” response to Humane World’s campaign for a ban. The commission’s sanction of the contests on the heels of its rejection of a ban, he said, “sets an unprecedented precedent” and tells Nevadans “don’t bring your issues forward if we disagree with them, because if you do, there’s going to be a cost, and we’re going to do the opposite of what you asked.”
Hardy says he intends to “try to get the legislative commission to reject that insulting regulation and then back to the drawing board.” Legislative action, he says, “is likely our only recourse.”
One Nevada? 
Two of Nevada’s most populous municipalities, Clark County and the City of Reno, have passed resolutions to stop the contests. The commission, however, has held firm, despite threats of legislative action, or in the alternative, an overhaul of the commission. 
Activists argue hunting and ranching interests have a stranglehold on the commission, and by extension, on Nevada wildlife. 
“It is telling that the prescribed solutions to managing wildlife regularly imposed by this commission invariably involve the death, destruction and permanent removal of wildlife species and vegetation such as pinion juniper,” commented Boulder City resident Fred Voltz. “The ‘killing is conservation’ concept so often invoked has not served our state, its wildlife, or the majority of Nevadans who do not have an irrational bloodlust and need for domination and submission of wildlife species.”
The Wildlife Commission is made up of nine members who are appointed by the governor. The commission must have five “sportsmen,” i.e. hunters, fishermen or trappers who have purchased a license in three of the past four years, one rancher, one farmer, one conservationist, and one member of the public. 
It is the “the least democratic of all state boards or commissions which provide oversight to a public resource,” Don Molde, who battled the commission for decades until his death in July, said in 2021. “In fact, I’m not sure there is another that is so tilted.”  
Hardy suggests the Legislature “should also take a look at whether the board is representative of the full state. We are certainly not stopping the fight.”
Despite the outcome of the commission’s vote, activists were encouraged that three commissioners voted against regulation – Caviglia and newest members Liz Munn, who represents conservation, and Wyatt Mesna, who represents ranching interests. In the past, only the conservation representative has voted in line with activists’ interests. 
Those interests extend beyond killing contests to include the state’s recreational bear hunt, the mountain lion hunt, leghold trapping, “and most of all, the undemocratic composition” of the Wildlife Commission, Myers wrote in an email to supporters following the meeting.  
“Tommy Caviglia was right. We are not going away,” she said. “Our numbers will swell as more residents become aware of our issues.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dead-coyotes-1024x863.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by Jason Getz-Pool/Getty Images)Attorney John Eastman, whose residence in Santa Fe prompted protests following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, is one of the 77 people President Donald Trump pardoned recently. That pardon protects them from any criminal legal consequences for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
According to media reports and federal prosecutors, Eastman was one of two lawyers behind the effort to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 election and to orchestrate slates of fake electors in several states to subvert the results naming former President Joe Biden as the election winner. 
Trump’s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, posted the undated list including Eastman on social media on Sunday evening. The proclamation from Trump offers an unconditional pardon to those named for conduct related to the fake electors, “as well as for any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 Presidential Election.”
Jack Smith, special counsel for the Justice Department during Biden’s term, identified Eastman, along with fellow pardon recipients Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell, as unindicted co-conspirators in an indictment against Trump for the president’s efforts to stay in office after losing the election to Biden. 
The pardons have no immediate effect, because, as is the case with Eastman, none of the pardon recipients has been federally indicted. But the pardons preclude future presidents from bringing federal criminal cases against Eastman and others on the list, according to Politico. 
Leading up to the indictment against Trump in which Eastman was named, federal agents seized Eastman’s cell phone after confronting him in a Santa Fe restaurant parking lot, which Eastman later sued over. 
Eastman did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiries via email and phone call Tuesday.
Despite Trump’s pardon, Eastman is facing criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia for his alleged part in recruiting and organizing fake electors. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases, according to local news reports. 
After entering a not guilty plea at a court in Arizona last May, he told reporters that, “I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona [and] zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings,” the Associated Press reported. “And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully exonerated at the end of this process.”
While the pardon does not affect local prosecutors’ cases, those cases are largely stalled, according to the Associated Press.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1938433171-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

Wendell Jones, D-Greenville, in House chambers on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As the longest federal government shutdown in history nears an end, a state representative who’s running for governor says South Carolina lawmakers need to ensure a future congressional stalemate doesn’t again threaten families’ ability to put food on the table.
The federal government usually provides 100% of the funding for grocery benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
But Rep. Jermaine Johnson plans to file a bill ahead of the upcoming legislative session to automatically provide temporary state funding to cover the food benefits for South Carolinians in any future government shutdown or pause for any other reason.
“I was one of those kids who relied on food stamps to eat,” the Hopkins Democrat said. “I know exactly what these families are facing because I lived it. That’s why I am filing a bill to make sure South Carolina families never go hungry because Washington has failed them once again.”
The draft legislation provided to the SC Daily Gazette establishes what Johnson is calling the South Carolina Nutritional Bridge Fund, which the state Department of Social Services would administer.
In the case that the U.S. Department of Agriculture announces a disruption to the SNAP program, the state agency would work through an outside contractor to load families’ normal monthly benefits onto existing debit cards using the bridge money. This would allow families to continue using their cards to buy groceries until federal funding resumes.


The bill calls for $100 million to be set aside in the budget annually until the fund reaches a balance of $500 million.
By comparison, South Carolina residents currently receive about $105 million in SNAP benefits each month. That’s across more than 260,000 households, according to DSS data.
Under the proposal, only residents already enrolled in SNAP at the time of a shutdown would continue to receive benefits through the fund.
If the account begins running low or doesn’t have enough to fully fund benefits, the state would divide the money proportionately among recipients until depleted.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 resulted in a suspension of food benefits for November. In South Carolina, SNAP benefits go out to recipients on a staggered schedule over the first 19 days of each month, according to a chart provided to the Gazette.
That means anyone due their monthly allotment — which last month averaged about $190 per person — between Nov. 1 and Nov. 12 has already missed out.
With the halt looming, Gov. Henry McMaster on Oct. 28 activated the One SC Fund, the state’s disaster relief fund, to collect donations and distribute them to food banks as a way to help fill the gap. But even with a record number of people donating to the fund, the aid has been a fraction of the normal benefits through SNAP.
South Carolina has a surplus of tax collections, as well as reserves, that could be tapped to help fill the gap. But only the Legislature has the authority to spend that money. And legislators aren’t scheduled to return to Columbia until mid-January.
Sen. Deon Tedder, D-Charleston, asked McMaster to force the Legislature back, but under the rules governing the off-session, he lacks that authority too. Only the chambers’ leaders can call a special session. But even if they did, a debate on how much to spend from which account — or whether to spend anything since the USDA made clear it would not reimburse states — could drag on for weeks.
It was also unclear how DSS would distribute any state money. The state’s contract with a third-party vendor covers transfers from the federal government to benefit cards. Handling state money could require a different contract.
Johnson’s bill seeks to eliminate all of those hurdles with a law that automatically triggers a transfer. It would also give DSS the authority to make any changes needed to keep the money flowing.
At least four Democrats in the state House plan to sign on as co-sponsors. Johnson plans to submit his bill when pre-filing opens Dec. 16.
But pre-filing a bill doesn’t give it any special advantage in the session that starts Jan. 13. Johnson didn’t say whether he’s gotten support, or how he hopes to get it, from Republicans who hold a supermajority in both chambers.
“D.C. dysfunction should never decide whether a child in South Carolina eats,” Johnson said. “If Washington has lost its moral compass, South Carolina will use its own. We will take care of our own and make sure no family goes hungry because politicians in Washington refuse to do their jobs.”
The longest government shutdown in history — a record set last week — is expected to end this week. But it remains unclear when full November SNAP benefits will flow.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_4632-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: A year of balance, progress and putting Vermonters first.","This commentary is by John Rodgers, lieutenant governor of Vermont.


As I wrap up my first year as Vermont’s lieutenant governor, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about where we’ve been — and where we’re headed. It’s no secret that folks are feeling squeezed these days. Whether it’s the cost of housing, heating fuel, health care or just keeping up with everyday expenses, Vermont’s affordability crisis is real, and it’s affecting people in every corner of our state.
But here’s the good news: this year, we proved that when Montpelier is balanced — when no one party can simply bulldoze the other — we can actually roll up our sleeves and get things done. For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
We passed important housing and infrastructure bills that will help get more homes built, improve local roads and water systems, and start tackling the cost drivers behind so many of our challenges. We also got the train moving on long-overdue education reform. None of it was easy, but the progress we made shows what’s possible when people from different parties sit down, listen to each other and find common ground. That’s the Vermont way.
It’s easy to get discouraged watching what’s happening in Washington, D.C. The partisanship, the gridlock, the finger-pointing — it’s enough to make anyone lose faith.
But Vermont isn’t Washington. We don’t have to act like them. We can still lead with respect, with decency and with the understanding that there’s more that unites us than divides us.
It’s going to take all of us working together to get Vermont back on track. That is why I have an open-door policy in my office and spend so much time traveling around the state listening to Vermonters. I know the best ideas come from working Vermonters. We can’t view running for office as a means to grow a career, rather it must be for the purpose of serving.
As a farmer, small business owner and community servant, I’ve seen a lot. But that doesn’t mean I do not have more to learn from you.
Over the next few weeks, I’ll be traveling around the state, visiting communities big and small and talking with Vermonters about what’s working — and what’s not. I want to hear directly from you about what a nonpartisan Montpelier can do better.
Gov. Phil Scott has set a great example of steady, practical leadership that puts people first, not politics. My goal is to keep building on that — to keep finding ways to make Vermont more affordable and more livable for everyone, no matter your class, income level, ZIP code or political stripe.
At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: a Vermont where our kids can grow up, our seniors can retire with dignity and families don’t have to move away just to make ends meet. That’s what drives me every day.
We may not agree on everything, but if we keep talking, keep listening and keep working together — I believe we can get there. Because that’s what Vermonters do best.

(Photo by Erick Doxey/InvestigateWest)When Camerina Zorrozua learned in April that Washington had slashed its state funding of her Spokane-based legal aid organization, she frantically called state Rep. Tarra Simmons.
“I was so alarmed, and I asked her straight up, ‘What happened?’” said Zorrozua, the legal director and co-founder of The Way to Justice.
Simmons, the first formerly incarcerated lawmaker in Washington, has vowed to fight for other formerly incarcerated people and was the state representative who Zorrozua thought would have fought hardest against the cuts. 
In 2021, Simmons, D-Bremerton, helped secure state funding to help hundreds of thousands of people vacate drug-related convictions from their criminal records, after the Washington Supreme Court deemed the state’s felony drug possession law to be unconstitutional in a ruling known as State v. Blake. In 2023, Simmons was able to vacate her own felony convictions. In media reports, she said it felt like she had been liberated from an “invisible prison.”

But the state Legislature’s decision in April to slash funding was a blow to organizations like The Way to Justice that have been key in providing legal support to those eligible to vacate their cases. And Simmons didn’t offer Zorrozua much of an explanation. 
“She made it seem like she didn’t know,” Zorrozua said. 
In fact, emails obtained by InvestigateWest show that, behind the scenes, Simmons supported the cuts, telling her colleagues that the state was nearly done with its work despite state data showing that only 38% of all the unconstitutional convictions had been vacated as of July 2025.
“My position about Blake legal funding is that it is wasteful regardless of which organization gets it,” Simmons wrote in an email to other lawmakers, including the chair and vice chairs of the House appropriations committee, where budget recommendations are made.
“In a time where we are in a budget shortfall and making decisions about cutting services to our most vulnerable people in WA, I do not believe community outreach to try and find class members four years after the case is a priority,” she wrote.
The emails, which state lawmakers have historically fought to be exempt from public disclosure, give a peek into the decision-making that left the impacted legal aid organizations and the state agency that doles out the funds confused and scrambling. The Office of Civil Legal Aid was originally allocated around $5 million in both the draft House and Senate biannual budgets to support its Blake-related civil legal aid efforts, but in the waning days of the legislative session, the funding disappeared from the final budget.
In State v. Blake, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state’s simple drug possession law was unconstitutional because it lacked language related to criminal intent, effectively criminalizing even “innocent and passive possession” of drugs in violation of a person’s due process rights. The historic decision not only made Washington’s law void but also made an estimated 330,000 past misdemeanor and felony convictions dating as far back as 1971 eligible to be wiped from a person’s criminal record. The state also must refund any financial costs stemming from the convictions. The number of eligible cases is considered a significant undercount because Washington’s court system makes it difficult to gather historical conviction data.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that it wasn’t her intention to harm legal aid organizations, but given the extremely tight state budget, difficult decisions had to be made. “I’ve always fought for my community,” she said. “But my community also needs things like housing and food.”
A screenshot of an email from Rep. Tarra Simmons to fellow lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session regarding funding to civil legal aid organizations helping the state vacate hundreds of thousands of unconstitutional drug convictions.
But others have argued that the cuts were less about cost savings and more about her ongoing personal conflict with one of the state-supported legal aid organizations, Civil Survival. She served as its executive director from 2015 until she was fired from the organization in July 2024 following two separate third-party investigations that found repeated violations of the organization’s policies, according to an open letter from its Board of Directors. When the budget cuts were made, Simmons was simultaneously suing the organization, which had received around $800,000 in 2023 and 2024 to support its Blake-related work, according to state contracts. The 2023 contract was signed by Simmons.
“Those funds weren’t wasteful when she was at the organization,” said Virla Spencer, the co-founder and CEO of The Way to Justice, referring to Simmons’ time at Civil Survival. “So make it make sense.”
 Still a long way to go

On April 14, Washington state Sen. Drew Hansen sent an email to two budget analysts asking if cutting the Blake funding to the civil legal aid organizations would “do great damage.” It was two weeks before the budget was set to be finalized, during a time when every program was facing scrutiny as lawmakers scrambled to address a projected $16 billion budget shortfall.
Hansen, D-Bainbridge Island, wrote in the email that Simmons had shared with him that most of the state’s Blake-related work was “done” and that they were reaching the point of diminishing returns. Hansen, a lawyer, helped Simmons vacate her criminal record in 2023.
“I actually think my colleague may be on to something here (like, do we really need to do ‘outreach’ at the magnitudes that we’re currently doing),” Hansen wrote in an email to a budget analyst in April. “But I don’t have any expertise in this area and it’s hard for me to evaluate.”
While Simmons claimed to her fellow lawmakers that the Blake work was nearly complete, state data tells a different story.

Only 29% of eligible cases in superior courts; 10% of cases in district courts; and 36% of cases in municipal courts have been successfully vacated as of July 2025, according to a data analysis compiled by the Washington Office of Public Defense using Washington State Patrol data. The team estimates it will take another six years to vacate the remaining cases. 
In Kitsap County, which Hansen and Simmons represent, 57% of cases in Superior Court, 18% of cases in the municipal court, and 2% in the District Court have been vacated. There are approximately 6,117 cases left in the county eligible to be vacated.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that she thinks the cases that are left are for people who have either moved out of state or died, which is why she felt like the funds should be allocated elsewhere. When directed to the state data showing that only 38% of eligible cases have been vacated as of July 2025, Simmons said she still stood by her assessment. 
“Seniors need food, kids need food, Medicaid is being cut, and undocumented citizens need civil legal aid,” she said. “It just does not seem like that is the top priority.”
While some courts have been proactive in identifying and vacating eligible Blake cases, others have left it up to the individuals to navigate the convoluted system and initiate the process independently. The state has been working to streamline the process and provide more support to local courts tasked with identifying and vacating their eligible cases, but there’s still a long way to go.
The process, which has to be initiated at the court where the conviction was given, involves three distinct steps: resentencing cases that involve more than just a possession charge; vacating eligible cases off a person’s criminal record; and filing a refund request with the state’s Blake Refund Bureau once a vacate is issued, which can be anywhere from a few dollars to thousands.
Civil legal aid and reentry organizations have been critical in helping to get the word out about the historic ruling and guiding people through the legal process. According to previous state contracts, the state funding historically doled out by the state’s Office of Civil Legal Aid was specifically to fund legal services, public education campaigns and targeted services for people impacted by President Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” which helped fuel mass incarceration and disproportionately targeted communities of color. 
While the funding to the Office of Civil Legal Aid was cut this year, two other state agencies are still receiving funding related to Blake: the Office of Public Defense, to support counties proactively working through their Blake cases; and the Administrative Office of the Courts, which provides refunds for any legal financial obligations paid as a result of the unconstitutional conviction.
Zorrozua, from The Way to Justice, said she’s grateful for the work Rep. Simmons has done around criminal justice reforms, like helping to pass the New Hope Act, which makes it easier for a person to vacate their criminal record to improve access to housing and employment.
But Simmons is “way off base here” about Blake funding, she said.
Outreach is a critical component of Blake work, Zorrozua said. They’ve planned pop-up events, vaccination clinics and tabling at community events where they can meet people outside of a court setting to build trust.
“She’s forgetting about all of her brothers and sisters who have been through the carceral process, who don’t have the privilege to have private counsel come in and clear their records,” Zorrozua said.

In late October, Zorrozua said she assisted a man with immigration status issues who had a Blake-eligible conviction on his record. Removing the unconstitutional conviction from his record would “make a huge difference” in whether or not he wins his immigration case, she added. Since the budget cuts, the Way to Justice has had to start charging clients for its services. 
“I don’t want to wait for our clients to die to close the Blake file,” she stressed. “They are entitled to relief. They were entitled to relief years ago.”
Zorrozua said it feels as if Simmons has a short-term memory.
“Because I remember when I went into one of her campaign events, this used to be what Tarra ran on, justice for impacted communities,” she said. “She’s saying she’s focusing on immigration, housing and employment. And it’s like, how the hell don’t you see the connections between those things?”
 ‘Personal conflict’

In the email to her fellow lawmakers at the end of the 2025 legislative session, Simmons acknowledged she had a “personal conflict” with Civil Survival but stressed to her peers that she wasn’t advocating for the funding to be cut specifically from her former organization, but to all of the organizations.
Simmons was fired in 2024 from Civil Survival for repeatedly mistreating staff and violating policies, according to a statement published by the organization’s staff, and for threatening to cut off critical funding.
She later sued the organization for discrimination and wrongful termination, alleging that she didn’t receive the disability accommodations she’d requested for post-traumatic stress disorder. They reached a settlement in September 2025 for an undisclosed amount. “I got a large amount of money because they harmed me,” she said. “It’s been a very painful thing.”
Corey Guilmette, the co-executive director at Civil Survival, told InvestigateWest that they chose to settle the case with Simmons to protect the formerly incarcerated members of their staff from having to testify in court.
“We are dedicated to helping our community heal and continuing litigation that would force not only directly impacted staff members, but community members, including people in prison, to confront their trauma in a courtroom, did not advance that mission,” he said. 
Guilmette said the state funding cuts caused them to lay off staff attorneys. 
“We pretty much have to turn away two-thirds of clients, because if we say yes to any more than that, we know that we won’t be able to serve people adequately,” he said.

In the run-up to the 2020 election, all 20 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters they’d pursue bold changes to health care, such as a government-run insurance plan or expanding Medicare to cover every American.
Fast-forward to the congressional stalemate that has closed the federal government for more than a month. Democrats, entrenched on one side of the legislative battle, staked their political future on merely preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act — a far cry from the systemic health policy changes that party members once described as crucial for tackling the high price of care.
Democrats succeeded in focusing national attention on rising health insurance costs, vowing to hold up funding for the federal government until a deal could be made to extend the more generous tax subsidies that have cut premiums for Obamacare plans. Their doggedness could help them win votes in midterm elections next year.
But health care prices are rocketing, costly high-deductible plans are proliferating, and 4 in 10 adults have some form of health care debt. As health costs reach a crisis point, a yawning gulf exists between voters’ desire for more aggressive action and the political urgency in Washington for sweeping change.
“There isn’t a lot of eagerness among politicians,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist who played a key role in drafting the ACA. “Why aren’t they being more bold? Probably scars from the ACA fights. But health care is a winning issue. The truth is we need universal coverage and price regulation.”
Voters rank lowering health care costs as a top priority, above housing, jobs, immigration, and crime, according to a September poll by Hart Research Associates for Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.
And costs are climbing. Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. For all the attention given to grocery, gas, and energy prices, health premiums and deductibles in recent years have risen faster than overall inflation and wages.
Democratic headwinds
The appetite for big, bold ideas to drive down such high costs has waned in part because Democrats lack political leverage, according to economists, political strategists, and health care advocates. They’ve also been burned before for backing significant changes.
After the ACA was enacted in 2010, for example, a backlash over the law — and its mandate that most everyone have insurance — helped Republicans win the House and gain seats in the Senate. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the public option, a proposed government-run plan that would compete against commercial insurance. She lost to Donald Trump.
Democrats are also outnumbered in Congress. Sweeping changes to health care, such as the creation of Medicaid and Medicare and passage of the ACA, historically have occurred when one party has controlled both Congress and the presidency. Republicans currently have all that muscle. So for now, Democrats are fighting to preserve the status quo while portraying Republicans as a threat to Americans’ insurance coverage.
If the ACA subsidies aren’t extended, many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law’s marketplaces will see their premiums more than double next year, according to KFF. A KFF Health Tracking Poll released Nov. 6 found that three-quarters of the public supported extending them.
“There’s no doubt people believe the current system needs reform,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “Protecting people from premium increases is part of that. You don’t win the future by losing the present.”
Even bipartisan legislative proposals aimed at lowering health costs have fizzled in an environment defined by political threats and partisan social media attacks.
Bills that would have improved health care price transparency and reined in companies that manage prescription drug benefits gained traction in late 2024 as part of a spending package. Then Elon Musk, who was serving as a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, took to his social media platform, X, to rally opposition, deriding the budget bill for what he asserted was excessive government spending.
GOP leaders dropped the health provisions, prompting Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to say on X that Musk “tweeted to kill” the bipartisan health policies that Congress had hammered out.
But Democrats’ focus on health care has cut both ways. Their messaging amid efforts to save the ACA from repeal and to preserve the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions helped the party take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. “I still have PTSD from the experience,” Republican Mike Johnson, now the House speaker, said recently.
And voters want relief. Six in 10 Americans are extremely or very worried about health care costs rising next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
Hagen Wenzek, 56, is among them. The chief executive of GI Digital, a high-tech startup, felt a pain in his calf in late summer and asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT what it might be. It suggested he could have deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot. He went to the emergency room and obtained an ultrasound that confirmed the diagnosis, so doctors monitored him and gave him blood thinners.
His insurance was billed $7,422, and Wenzek got a bill for $890. The average cost of an ultrasound is about $400 without insurance, according to GoodRx, a digital health platform.
“The hospital is making thousands for a procedure that costs $500. It’s kind of ridiculous,” said Wenzek, of Sleepy Hollow, New York. “I have a $40 copay just to go see a doctor for anything, and I’m on a startup budget.”
‘Defending the Status Quo’
The lack of bolder ideas to tackle spiraling costs could also work against Democrats, some critics say. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, in an episode of his podcast in October, accused Democrats of committing “malpractice” by not presenting ideas to fix what people hate about the health care system. Instead, he said, they’re shutting the government down to protect a system that voters already believe is failing them.
“Once again, the Democrats are in a position of defending the status quo of policies that most people in the United States think suck,” he said. “Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump rolls out TrumpRx. Hey, I’ll just threaten Pfizer with 100% tariffs and then just open up a prescription drug outside of the middle managers and sell directly to the public at a discount.”
TrumpRx, which is intended to help patients find lower-priced drugs, and pledges by Big Pharma to lower drug prices could help the GOP with voters, though Democrats are also hammering Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the bill the president signed into law in July that reduces Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Republicans are promising fixes, using the shutdown to try to leverage voter frustration. Vice President JD Vance said on Newsmax in October that “we do have a plan, actually,” in reference to a question about health care reform. (Trump has promised repeatedly that he would produce a plan to replace the ACA but never has.)
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on CNBC in October that Trump wants to overhaul the ACA and “give people health insurance that is higher-quality and more affordable.”
The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment from Vance.
“It’s not that Democrats are focusing on tax credits to the exclusion of bigger, bolder reforms,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA. “If you can get the conversation on health care, if we can prevent premiums from spiking, then we can focus on why health care costs so darn much to begin with.”
But some Democrats say voters are hurting and want bigger and bolder ideas now. Earlier this year, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on the podcast “Fast Politics” that the party needs to offer more on health care in the next election.
“I’ll tell you what people are going to expect,” he said. “They’re not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA. They’re going to expect universal health care.”
For now, at least, there are more innovative ideas in states. Oregon has established a governing board to set up a single-payer health system in which the state would take on health care financing — eliminating private insurance, premiums, and all deductibles for all residents as soon as 2027. The question is whether it will work. Vermont abandoned a similar effort in 2014.
“With the political environment we’re in, there isn’t currently an appetite for big reform, but we know it needs to happen,” said Mona Shah, the senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “Across party lines, people want government intervention in health care and people want universal coverage. The pain point that people are feeling, the public sentiment is where we were at before the ACA.”

(Getty Images)Parents of autistic children — and ABA therapy providers — may soon encounter new usage limits, reimbursement rates and other changes as Indiana attempts to slow rising Medicaid spending.
About 20 recommendations, released Wednesday morning by a state-backed panel, could shape upcoming service shifts for thousands of Hoosiers.
“There will still be growth, just not as much, and it still protects the current ABA access for children and families who need it,” said Eric Miller, the deputy secretary and chief of staff for the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.

Miller was among the nearly two-dozen state leaders, health professionals and others charged with evaluating “cost containment” strategies that “minimize” the negative impact on enrollees. Gov. Mike Braun directed FSSA to organize the working group in a February executive order.
Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, therapy is often used to improve communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders.
Its popularity has surged in recent years. More than 8,000 Hoosiers rely on Medicaid to pay for ABA therapy, with most of them between three and eight years of age.
“This is something that’s very valuable — but at the same time, we know it’s unsustainable, the current cost trajectory,” said Miller. His agency, FSSA, administers the state’s Medicaid program.
Two of Miller’s own children have benefitted from ABA therapy.
Other recommendations are meant to boost quality and improve oversight, in response to a revealing federal audit.
Program updates on the way — again
Indiana’s Medicaid program began covering ABA services in 2016, spending about $21 million over the following year.
Expenditures peaked at $611 million in 2023, and dropped slightly to $445 million in 2024, after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration set lower reimbursement rates.
His FSSA also moved to limit services.


A Medicaid State Plan Amendment, which was set to take effect April 1, would’ve capped treatment to 30 hours weekly for three years — retroactively. That would have cut off about half of the children using the service immediately.
Braun’s administration pulled that proposal.
“The governor decided this was cruel and unusual punishment, and we weren’t going to do that,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said.
The agency filed another State Plan Amendment, with a July 1 effective date, that would’ve raised weekly limits for enrollees with higher needs — and applied prospectively. But it’s also getting scrapped.
FSSA plans to use Wednesday’s findings to draw up a new slate of changes.
Without intervention, costs could reach an estimated $825 million in 2029. Officials say that the state can’t afford that.

“The working group and the whole package of recommendations … is projected to reduce that annual growth rate (to) around 7%-8% instead of 13%,” Miller said.
There’s no dollar amount in anticipated savings available yet, however.
“We don’t make these choices in a vacuum, right? We provide services to 1.8 million people,” Roob said.
The agency plans to bring an ABA proposal — and a new Medicaid revenue forecast — to the State Budget Committee in December.
It could submit an updated State Plan Amendment to the federal government by the end of the year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must approve the modifications for them to take effect.
Key usage, rate changes
The working group recommended doing away with weekly limits and tiers of care on “comprehensive” ABA therapy, opting to instead pose a “lifetime” allocation of 4,000 hours.
That is fewer hours than the previous proposals would’ve allowed over a three-year period, but it is more flexible, Miller emphasized — and it’s not retroactive.
Once that cap is hit, enrollees would be eligible for up to 15 hours of “targeted” therapy per week.
Cuts to reimbursement rates for one-on-one therapy are likely, although the group didn’t agree on a specific number or range to endorse in the report.
“FSSA may reduce current rates for individual ABA therapy as deemed necessary to stay within the agency’s appropriated budget,” the recommendation reads.
Rates for group therapy, however, may be raised.

The state’s “significantly” lower reimbursement has driven low utilization, the working group found.
Hiking rates to “financially viable” levels would promote “one-on-one therapy time for children with the most significant needs, while providing a cost-effective, appropriate ‘step-down’ option for others.”
Decisions on rates are expected closer to FSSA’s presentation before the State Budget Committee next month, according to Miller.
Parents could also be required to get involved in their children’s therapy. The working group recommended nine to 18 hours of coaching or training per six-month authorization period.
“This therapy is usually done (outside) the home, which means the parent … can choose to be less engaged,” Roob said. “If the taxpayer’s spending that much money on helping this child, we believe that parent or caregiver needs to be engaged.”

Other recommendations seek to help children transition out of comprehensive care, when appropriate, and move on to lower-intensity or alternative forms of support.
“It’s (about) what’s next for the child … once they graduate (from) ABA therapy,” Miller said.
He recalled transition planning beginning “almost immediately” for his children, like if they’d continue being home-schooled or move on to public or private schools. Therapy activities can change depending on those goals, Miller noted.
FSSA has been following cohorts of enrollees who began therapy in 2020, according to the report, and found “no observable decline” in average weekly hours after three years of care.
Accreditation, location changes for providers
Indiana has more than ABA 320 therapy locations, per the report. The number of providers shot up by 25% between just 2023 and 2025.
The state currently doesn’t require any accreditation or licensure for ABA therapy organizations to bill Medicaid — or have any other limits on provider growth.
The working group agreed that should change.
“We really saw that there was an increased need for that oversight to ensure that the growing number of providers really are providing high-quality ABA therapy,” Miller said.
The report suggested requirements cover quality, service ratios and outcomes monitoring; risk management and patient safety; and more.
Story continues below.
EO 25-31 ABA Working Group Recommendations Final
 
The state could use an existing accreditation body like the Autism Commission on Quality, or an external vendor. Miller said there have been “pre-conversations” with ACQ.
“What I would say is, over the next month or two, we’d be putting the details out there, and then it’s probably like a yearlong process, because we’ve got to go through all the providers,” he added.
The working group also took aim at areas with overly high concentrations of ABA sites in hopes of encouraging expansion in underserved communities.
Sites are mostly in urban locations in central and northern Indiana, with “noticeably fewer” providers southwest.
Under one recommendation, FSSA would request federal approval to temporarily block new providers or sites in designated counties from billing to Medicaid. The six-month moratorium could be extended.
The agency would “evaluate the implications” to avoid unwanted consequences, like providers establishing sites in neighboring counties that serve the same areas or starting in-home ABA services.
In the meantime, FSSA would create “incentives” for providers to expand to areas with fewer options. It’s unclear what form those strategies might take, however.
“To be determined,” FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow wrote.
Other strategies
Private insurers took some heat in the report, too.
“Evidence suggests that, in general, private insurers pay below Medicaid rates for ABA,” working group members wrote. They asserted that’s creating “perverse incentives” for providers to prefer Medicaid-covered children. And, Medicaid has to pay the difference between the private and public rates for those who have both insurance types.
Braun’s administration should consider supporting legislation to require group health insurers to adopt a rate schedule above Medicaid rates, they recommended. Group plans are purchased by employers from state-regulated insurance carriers. However, 70% of Hoosiers with private insurance have employer-funded plans, which are regulated at the federal level.
The working group additionally recommended that Indiana beef up its third-party liability processes, which the Medicaid program uses to identify and collect payments from other responsible parties — like private insurance companies. The report emphasized that those insurers are the primary payer when coverage exists, with Medicaid being the “payer of last resort.”
Under another recommendation, FSSA would work with schools on their responsibilities. When ABA is medically necessary, Medicaid or private insurance funds it, but when the therapy is a behavioral support, schools fund it. State rules and federal law guarantee disabled children the right to a free and appropriate public education.
Does the state’s Open Door law apply to the ABA working group?

The report calls for FSSA to create a dedicated program office within the agency, which could implement many of the suggested strategies.
Right now, a trio of divisions hold ABA-related responsibilities, according to the report. One is the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning.
“Their job is to pay claims,” Roob said. “A claim comes in; they pay it, right? That’s what they’re told to do, right? They’re not told to be managing a program. They’re paying a claim.”
The new entity would have staff with clinical expertise, too.
There’s no set timeline. Miller said FSSA would start “as soon as we can find a qualified person” and build it out from there.
Several of the recommendations the program office could handle focus on improving service quality and fighting waste, fraud and abuse.
In a 2024 report, the U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General audited Indiana’s 2019 and 2020 ABA payments and found $56 million in improper payments and an additional $78 million in potentially improper payments. It recommended that Indiana refund more than $39 million to the federal government.
The audit cited problems with documentation, diagnostic evaluations, staff credentials, referrals and more. Cheaper group work was charged as more expensive individual therapies, or billed time included non-therapeutic activities like meal and bathroom breaks, for example.
FSSA is auditing the claims identified in the federal report and requiring refunds of any identified overpayments, according to the working group. The agency also initiated a program integrity review of Medicaid claims paid for ABA therapy from 2022 through 2025, and when it’s done, will make providers refund overpayments and go through compliance training.

I just love seeing their smiling, hopeful faces, watching them grow and learn, and welcoming the trust and love they bring to us every day.
At the same time, working in this field can be challenging. Babies and young children require a great deal of love and care, informed by expertise in early childhood development. Low pay is challenging for providers, and high costs are challenging for families.
But some states are looking for answers — and I believe mine has found one. New Mexico is now expanding its free, high-quality child care program so that all families can access it. It’s the first of its kind in the nation — and I hope other states will follow.
As of November 1, all families in the state are eligible for universal, no-cost child care. New facilities will be built, existing child care centers can apply for funds to improve their facilities, and child care providers will receive pay boosts.
Prior to this, our no-cost child care was available only to families with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line, and there were cost-prohibitive copay structures. This meant that we had to turn away many needy families.
When parents and caretakers can’t get child care, they lose work, educational opportunities, and enrichment opportunities for their kids. Or when families scrape to afford the exorbitant cost of child care, the rest of their budget — such as food, housing, healthcare, and educational expenses — suffers.
The purpose of this new, no-cost, universal child care program is many-fold: to improve early childhood education outcomes; to support parents’ ability to work; to provide child care workers with a livable wage; to increase the number and quality of child care centers; and to reduce the cost burden to families and strengthen communities.
Families will save an average of $12,000 per year with this program. That’s life-changing money for most working families. The universal program is funded by surplus revenues from New Mexico’s oil and gas industry and a portion of the Land Grant Permanent Fund — and the funds are paid directly to child care facilities.
I’ve been a teacher in the child care space for 25 years — and I’ve witnessed firsthand the problems this new program is meant to address.
I feel heartbroken each time we have to turn away a family who is desperate for care but can’t afford it. I see the positive impact our child care programs have on children, including lifelong benefits for their physical and emotional well-being and for their future educational and workforce attainment.
Former students who are now adults regularly reach out to me and thank me for all the care they remember receiving. I’m humbled by each act of thoughtfulness from these now successful adults. Recently, one family for whom I taught all five of their children invited me to be the guest of honor at a graduation for one of the adult children. I can’t put into words how special and appreciated that made me feel.
Child care centers are pillars of the community, providing an excellent start in life for our children, freeing up parents and caretakers to earn a living, and strengthening the economy and well-being of our communities. It’s a travesty that child care is prohibitively expensive — and that child care workers are woefully underpaid in the rest of the country.
Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation. My hope is that all states will follow New Mexico’s lead and enact a similar, no-cost universal child care program for all families.

(Courtesy photo)Six Hoosier school communities sought to pass referendums in the most recent election. Five succeeded, and one fell short. Yet just a few weeks earlier, postcards went out to constituents all across Indiana in which state representatives touted the 5% increase in K-12 funding last session as the “highest funding level to date for Hoosier students.” 
In addition, the postcards claimed that the latest educational results prove that Indiana is leading the way by “putting students first.” To be clear, adding even one penny to last year’s budget would also produce “the highest funding level to date.” While we at the Indiana Coalition for Public Education celebrate the successes of our public schools and the hard work of educators and students, we urge Hoosiers to look beyond the glossy postcard for a fuller picture. 
While the highest dollar amount for K-12 education funding may have emerged from last session, it is not the highest level of funding we have seen. Ball State University Economist Michael Hicks has written that currently, when adjusted for inflation, “in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010.” Also, in 2024, the Education Data Initiative reported that Indiana ranks 37th of 50 states in education spending per pupil. 
Fewer Resources, more subsidies 
Alongside the lack of budget support for public schools, bills passed last session are poised to reduce public education funding. A property tax overhaul, SEA1, will cut the revenue that public schools rely upon for transportation, capital projects, and referendums. Another new law will require public school districts to share their property taxes with charter schools — publicly funded, privately run entities — further draining resources. While Indiana struggles to pay teachers a competitive salary during a teacher shortage, these priorities do not add up. 
Last session, lawmakers lifted the income cap on Indiana’s largest voucher program, making millionaires and billionaires eligible to receive taxpayer-funded subsidies for their private school tuition payments. More students are now getting a smaller piece of a shrinking education pie. Last school year alone, nearly a half billion dollars went to voucher schools, which legally don’t have to account for where the money goes. 
Literacy is foundational to all learning, and early childhood education is foundational to all educational outcomes. Yet, while our legislature gave K-12 vouchers to the wealthiest Hoosier children for their private school tuition, they simultaneously took away vouchers for child care and slashed access to state-funded preschool for many of our most vulnerable kids. 
Accountability for public school funding
While we celebrate the progress of Hoosier students and the dedication that got them back to pre-pandemic-level scores on the IREAD test, we should recognize the impact of outside dollars poured into improving reading. Much of the touted gains in literacy were made possible thanks to the $2.9 billion distributed to Indiana by the federal government to help in recovery from the pandemic and learning “loss.” Additionally, students benefited from generous private funds from the Lilly Endowment for literacy. Money does matter. 
The aforementioned postcard also highlighted Indiana as ranking third in a Parent Power category by an organization promoting “school choice.” Hoosier parents overwhelmingly choose to send their children to public schools. Parents know the value of strong public schools. It is time for them to use their voices, their power, to ensure that the state funds and supports the public schools every child deserves. It is time to ask why we must vote locally to tax ourselves through referendums when the state fails to meet its constitutional obligation to ensure our public schools have what they need—while opportunity gaps widen for Hoosier kids. 
We celebrate the recent rise in test scores, as well as the magic that happens every day in our public schools. Yet, we also look to the future with concern and hope. Public schools are the heart of our communities — places that unite us across all backgrounds, accept all students, and empower our kids to become contributing members of our society. True commitment to “putting students first” means fully investing in our public schools so that every Hoosier child can thrive.

(Photo by Getty Images)Chuck Johnson raises timely issues in his Reformer commentary, “Time to rethink human services as Trump administration dumps costs on counties.”
Minnesota’s human service system is facing a crisis, and policy makers should seize the opportunity to rethink state and county roles.  
The state-supervised, county-delivered structure we rely on today was developed nearly a century ago, in the era of pen and paper, when the most practical way to apply for public assistance was to walk into a county office and fill out forms in person. 
But the world has changed dramatically. 
Today, Minnesotans expect services that are simple, fast and accessible online — anytime, from anywhere. The county office is no longer as convenient as the phone in our pocket. It is time to rethink how we structure and deliver human services across the state.
Human services programs touch nearly every Minnesotan at some point in life. 
The system supports parents caring for young children; adults struggling with mental health or substance use; seniors who need help remaining in their homes; people with disabilities who want to live independently; and families seeking food or housing stability during difficult times. 
These are not abstract programs. They support our neighbors, our co-workers, and often our own families. A well-functioning system strengthens families and communities and reduces long-term public costs. 
But when the system is confusing, slow, or fragmented, the consequences can be profound both for the Minnesotans seeking help and for the public resources that sustain them.
The core challenge of the state-county system is the disconnect between the Legislature, state agencies and county governments. 
The Legislature writes the laws. 
State agencies interpret, manage, and supervise them. 
Counties are responsible for delivering the services directly to residents. 
Over time, layers of well-intentioned rules and safeguards have accumulated, often in response to specific concerns or headlines. Each layer adds complexity — with new forms, verification steps, or reporting requirements. The result is a system that is difficult for residents to navigate and expensive to administer. County staff who want to help people instead spend hours verifying paperwork, chasing documentation, and ensuring compliance with sometimes contradictory requirements. 
Historically, the Legislature and state agencies did not feel the urgency to invest in better county technology or streamlined administrative processes, perhaps because by virtue of their roles they do not see the day-to-day inefficiencies that seep into the county budgets. We believe that is changing, as evidenced by the $40 million investment in updating one system last year — but there are many more systems that need the same attention.
For example, counties have estimated that just four areas of inefficiency — duplicate data entry, manual renewals, inefficient programming, and manual notices sent to clients because of system errors — cost more than $23 million per year in staff time.
Compounding the challenge, Minnesota counties are facing a tsunami of new “cost shares” from both federal and state governments, and we are struggling to stay afloat. This method of reducing state and federal budgets does not reduce the overall cost of the programs. It just shifts the cost down to property taxes instead of state and federal taxes. 
These challenges are why counties agree that it is time for the Legislature to invest in a comprehensive review of state and county responsibilities. 
This review should examine which services are best delivered consistently and centrally — through statewide systems, shared technology platforms, or uniform processes — and which are most effective when localized and tailored to community needs. 
For example, eligibility determinations and routine administrative processes may be more efficient if standardized statewide. 
In contrast, services like child protection, behavioral health coordination, and support for older adults often require close relationships with local providers, schools, law enforcement and community organizations. 
The goal should not be to shift everything to one level or another, but to align responsibility with the level of government best equipped to deliver high-quality service.
Counties are eager to be partners in this work. We see the strain on frontline staff, on families navigating complex requirements, and on property taxpayers funding a system that has not been updated to match modern needs. We also recognize the commitment of the Legislature and state agencies, who share our goal of serving Minnesotans effectively and responsibly.
Our state has a history of innovation and collaboration in public service. Our state-supervised, county-administered system was the right choice for Minnesotans when it was created. 
Now, we have an opportunity now to create a more streamlined and sustainable system — one that meets people where they are, reduces administrative burden, and uses public resources wisely.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/old-personcane-GettyImages-946924536-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by George Wuerthner).Prescribed burning is often promoted as a magic bullet that can prevent large wildfires, but it has several disadvantages that are seldom discussed.

The presumed purpose of the National Prescribed Fire Act 2025 is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires by investing in managing hazardous fuels. The legislation would accelerate and expand the use of prescribed burns during cooler, wetter months.
The legislation also includes a clause increasing the percentage of federal land on which prescribed burns occur each year. The legislation requires that the acreage burned be increased by 10% more than the amount burned in previous years.
While the goal is admirable—to reduce wildfire threats to communities—the assertion that such prescribed burns can reduce “catastrophic” fires is delusional. It displays the faulty expectations inherent in the legislation.
Large, so-called “catastrophic” blazes occur only when the right combination of climate and weather conditions exists. Extreme fire weather requires severe drought, low humidity, high temperatures, and, most importantly, high winds.
Fires that ignite under less-than-extreme fire weather conditions usually burn a small acreage and often self-extinguish, with or without fire suppression. In the United States, 98% of the fires never burn more than 300 acres.
On the other hand, if you have high winds—the conditions that lead to “catastrophic” blazes, prescribed burns don’t stop fire spread. Wind will blow embers over or around any area of a prescribed burn.
High winds regularly blow embers over lands without fuel, such as 16-lane freeways or across mile-wide rivers, as the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire did in the Columbia Gorge.
The second problem with the proposal is that you can’t predict where a fire will occur. On all U.S. Forest Service lands across the conterminous U.S., 6.2% of prescribed fire-treated areas from 2003–2022 encountered a subsequent wildfire in 2004–2023.
However, this statistic is deceptive. Just because a fire encountered a treated area does not mean the treatment had any effect on fire spread.
Beware of the time factor. For example, a study of smoke emissions in treated areas compared to untreated areas, showed a 14% reduction in particulate matter. However, the study focused on prescribed burns two years old or less. No one doubts that if a fire encounters a prescribed burn shortly after treatment, it can sometimes have an influence.
The effectiveness of fuel reductions declines over time. In many instances, burning or thinning promotes new plant growth. Often, within a few years, you may have more fuel than before treatment.
What grows back is dominated by “fine fuels” like grasses and shrubs. These fuels are more “flammable” than trees, large branches, logs, and other debris that may have existed prior to prescribed fire. So, prescribed burns can alter the fuel composition, increasing the likelihood of burning.
The only solution to this problem of plant regrowth is frequent burning. Depending on the plant community, one may need to reburn it every few years to preclude the creation of higher fuel loads. To be effective, you must continue the prescribed burning forever.
This means citizens must be ready to accept smoke as a nearly year-round inconvenience and health hazard.
I cannot delve into the entire flawed argument that “a hundred years of fire suppression” has led to fuel buildups or that Indian burning precluded large wildfires that proponents use to justify burns, but I encourage readers to consult my commentary on this issue.
The strategic use of prescribed burns near homes and communities may have some utility, but the advantages are grossly exaggerated. Given the many disadvantages, whether this is worth the costs is rarely discussed. Ultimately, we must address climate change, which is the underlying cause of large wildfires and hardened homes, so they are less vulnerable to any wildfire ignitions.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Wisconsin Democrats have announced a bill that would cap residential energy bills at 2% of household income. 
On Tuesday, Democrats said the proposal from Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) would protect Wisconsinites’ bank accounts while the state finds ways to expand clean energy production in the face of climate change and manage the increasing energy burden posed by data center developments across the state. 
“Rising energy rates are becoming an unsustainable burden on regular people in Wisconsin,” Madison said at a Tuesday morning press conference. “Our energy system still has big problems to tackle, like dramatically moving towards carbon-free electricity, or the challenge of data centers, which are currently on course to double the amount of energy creation in Wisconsin. Regardless of your stance on data centers, artificial intelligence and the role these technologies can or should play in our communities, the people of Wisconsin must have their energy burden lifted. This bill is a common sense, necessary protection for people struggling to afford their basic needs before we take further action on any of these things as legislators to address those issues.”
At the press conference, residents who have struggled with energy bills spoke about how getting power disconnected can reverberate through people’s lives, causing health problems or forcing choices between other household costs. 
“We’re doing everything we can, yet we still cannot keep up,” said Jill Sexton, a Wausau resident who is on disability assistance with a husband on Social Security. “I ended up taking a part time job specifically to cover the increase in our electric and heating bills. Nowadays, here’s our reality: Each month we choose between paying the electric bill and heat bill or filling our prescriptions. Some months I don’t buy the medication. Some months we stretch food until the very last day.”
Several lawmakers tied the bill to the national Democratic party’s growing focus on “affordability” and bipartisan skepticism of data centers. 
“We have the money. It’s all about how we prioritize where we spend it,” Rep. Ryan Spaude (D-Ashwaubenon) said at the press conference. “Folks in my district and around the state are on a knife’s edge. Many of them are just barely getting by. This bill is going to do something. It’s going to keep more money in their pockets. It deserves a hearing and it deserves to be passed by this body.” 
Legislators announced the bill just as communities are grappling with the construction of massive data centers across the state. While the centers can provide an easy source of property tax revenue for local governments, they also use a massive amount of water and energy — raising questions about the protection of local water supplies, adequacy of the state’s existing renewable energy sources and concerns that a data center-generated spike in energy use will be passed on to local ratepayers. 
Last week, Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) introduced a bill that would require data centers to cover the cost of increased energy use, mandate the development of more clean energy and ensure data center construction pays local workers living wages. 
“While our state energy system faces deep uncertainty, especially when it comes to the climate crisis, we’re responding to data centers that are going to have increasing energy demands and raise rates for many communities,” said Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) who is running in the Democratic primary for governor. “It is vital that we cap all utility payments at 2% of income so that we can protect our ratepayers and our communities first. This bill is a clear and systemic practical response to rising energy rates, and it’s one of the key cornerstone priorities of the Assembly Democrats’ affordability agenda.”
Under the rate cap bill, the Public Service Commission would be responsible for administering an energy burden relief fund. The fund would cover the difference for any household with energy costs that are more than 2% of the monthly household income. The bill would give the PSC 12 months after enactment to start the fund and three years to automatically enroll every eligible household. 
The bill would allow the PSC to prioritize households making less than 300% of the federal poverty level, only provide payments to cover energy costs for primary residences and provide a maximum energy use threshold to prevent people from receiving state aid for energy intensive home businesses such as mining cryptocurrency. 
Also, the bill would prevent public utility companies from disconnecting the service of people making less than 300% of the federal poverty level and require the PSC to annually report the number of utility disconnections.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wisconsin-farm-with-wind-turbine.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

(Photo by Amanda Brown/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s cannabis industry would see a host of changes under a new bill from Senate President Nicholas Scutari.
The measure would allow some medical marijuana dispensaries to sell recreational cannabis without getting an OK from local leaders, loosen ethics requirements for state cannabis regulators, and strip the governor of the power to name the chair of the state panel that regulates the industry.
Scutari (D-Union) has proposed some of this before, in a bill he introduced in January that never advanced in the Senate. Scutari, who is a major supporter of legalized cannabis, did not return a request for comment on the new bill.
One of the major changes in the new measure, introduced last week, would allow medical marijuana dispensaries to apply for a license to sell recreational cannabis without municipal approval. The bill would allow this even in towns that have banned recreational dispensaries.
When New Jersey legalized cannabis, it allowed towns to opt out of the recreational marijuana industry, and about 70% of them did. Some limit sales to medical cannabis only.
The number of people enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program has dwindled since cannabis became more readily available for people older than 21. Recreational users can purchase most cannabis products available at medical dispensaries, which was not the case when the industry launched more than three years ago.
The bill also seeks to change oversight rules for the five-member Cannabis Regulatory Commission by loosening restrictions on commissioners’ political activity and modifying rules that regulate when they can speak to people who have applications before the panel.
The measure would allow commission members and employees to attend political events with written notice by a member or the executive director. Commission members are already permitted to hold public office, but the bill has a provision explicitly allowing them to campaign for office and fundraise for those campaigns. 
Current law bars commission members from meeting with anyone who has applications or other matters before the panel except at the agency’s offices. The bill would end that ban and allow commissioners and employees of the agency to meet with people who have business before the agency at any locations designated by the commission.
While all those meetings would be required to be logged, they would not be subject to the state’s public meetings law unless they are attended by more than one person on the commission. Joshua Bachner, a cannabis attorney at Mandelbaum Barrett in Roseland, said this invites malfeasance.
“I don’t see how this is good at all, for anyone,” Bachner said. “This is opening up the floodgates for misconduct.”
Bachner also noted a provision of the bill would allow state employees and their family members to work in the cannabis industry, as long as state ethics officials or the New Jersey Supreme Court say it wouldn’t create a conflict of interest, or the “reasonable risk of the public perception” of one.
In 2023, New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner barred state courts employees from taking any jobs in the medical or recreational cannabis industry.
The bill would also increase commissioners’ salaries from $125,000 to $160,000 and the chair’s salary from $141,000 to $156,000.
The measure comes in the waning days of the current legislative session and Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20, campaigned in his first term on legalizing recreational cannabis. Voters approved legalization via a ballot question, and the first recreational dispensaries launched in April 2022.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rec_mari12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)In some of Idaho’s more rural communities, a public library can be the only source of reliable internet, a free meeting or study place, or the only place to get a book without having to order online. 
But to build or renovate a new library can be a herculean task when relying on a limited pool of funding from the small population. A few Gem State towns are celebrating, or getting ready to soon celebrate, the accomplishment of this task thanks to the support from their communities and library grant funding. 
Kendrick, Inkom and Fernwood are a few recent examples of small communities that got a new public library. 
 Kendrick’s new library to serve Juliaetta too amid closure of old building 

The north central Idaho community of Juliaetta had hosted and strongly supported a public library for years, but the more than 100-year old building was small and inaccessible to many people, according to Latah County Library District Director April Hernandez. 
“It’s been an issue for a long time,” Hernandez said. “We had a lot of patrons who couldn’t access the building.” 
Talks began to find a new site or building more than 20 years ago, she said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The library board, especially at that time, felt that Juliaetta had supported the library so well, they didn’t want to move it out of town, and so they spent 20 years looking for an alternative in Juliaetta to use,” she said. 
About three miles away, in Kendrick, an old bank building came on the market. The district bought it in November 2024. 
The city of Juliaetta had sold a park and raised donations for a new library amid the start of the search for a new building 20 years ago, Hernandez said. The district received $22,000 from that account and about $10,000 in a grant from the Latah County Library Foundation. In total, the district garnered almost $43,000 in grants and donations. 
The new library, located at 501 Main St., opened earlier this month. 
The single-floor building doesn’t require a ramp and is much more accessible, Hernandez said. It also has a meeting space with a kitchenette. The library district is in the process of widening the building’s Wi-Fi so it’s usable in the adjacent park. 
“I think that’s one of the big things for those areas, is connectivity, because cell service isn’t always real great down in the valley … and then Wi-Fi is expensive and hard to get in some locations,” Hernandez said. “So having that available in a wide array around the library, I think it’s important for a lot of people to be able to have any access to Wi-Fi at all.”

 Inkom library branch opens in response to population growth in area

Inkom, located just southeast of Pocatello, has been experiencing a lot of growth in recent years, but well before that, former South Bannock Library District Director Marcy Price had been working to open a branch in the area, according to the library district’s current director Megan Short. 
The town had only been served by a bookmobile previously, according to a past commentary piece in the Idaho Capital Sun by Michael Strickland. 
Multiple deals fell through, but a land swap with the Marsh Valley Joint School District finally provided an opportunity for Inkom to get its own library, Short said. 
In 2023, the library district received a $500,000 grant from the Idaho Commission for Libraries, through a federally funded grant program. In 2024, the community voted in favor of a special plant facilities reserve fund levy with just over 60% of the vote, East Idaho News reported. 
The levy is expected to generate just over $1 million over 10 years to finance the rest of the construction project. 
The district also used unexpended savings to cover costs and received some donations. The library itself is filled with many book donations, Short said. 
“The community support has been overwhelming,” she said. “So many questions everyday about when we’re opening, what’s going on, and what we’re going to have here.” 
The library, located at 321 Holstein St., is expected to have a limited opening in early January, with a grand opening in the spring.   
The new building will have printing services, 24-hour access to Wi-Fi in and just outside the building, a private telehealth or study room, a meeting room, and computers with accessible keyboards and a large screen, Short said. 
The printer and internet access seem to be particularly valuable to rural patrons, Short said.

 Community around Fernwood rallied in support of construction of new library 

The Fernwood Library of the Tri-Community Library also serves Santa and Emida, but librarians say they’ve had patrons travel from 40 miles away to visit, State Librarian Stephanie Bailey-White said at an August Idaho Commission for Libraries meeting.  
The library had been located in a building built in 1905. Like the Juliaetta library, it had small rooms and was inaccessible to many patrons. 
Many of the residents of the northern Idaho communities are at least 20 miles from medical services, so the Benewah County Free Library District wanted to prioritize a place for telehealth visits in a new location, Bailey-White said.
A library team was formed to start fundraising, and they garnered about $50,000 and around $240,000 worth of local in-kind contributions. 
 “They had tremendous community support,” Bailey-White said. 
In 2023, the state library commission awarded the district $500,000 for the new Fernwood branch. Ground broke in 2024 on the new building and the exterior was completed in June. 
The new library, located on Isaacson Street across the highway from the Fernwood Merc., was planned to open in the fall. 
The library director for the district could not be reached for comment. 
 Latah and South Bannock libraries say they’ve largely evaded challenges under Idaho’s ‘library’ law

Libraries had been the center of hot debate in the Idaho Legislature between 2022 and 2024, culminating in the passage of House Bill 710 in 2024. 
Idaho Legislature passes bill requiring Idaho libraries move ‘harmful materials’

The law allows children or their parents to file lawsuits against public or school libraries if they obtain materials deemed harmful to minors due to the presence of “sexual conduct.” 
Short and Hernandez said their districts had received no formal complaints since the law went into effect. 
Hernandez says sometimes people don’t like what they see on the shelves, but that these complaints are also usually met with explanations about why the materials are important to others in the community. 
The district’s policy includes a requirement that the patron read the entirety of the material they plan to complain about. 
“People don’t like some of this stuff, but there’s still people in their communities that relate to these diverse materials,” Hernandez said. 
Short also said she’s gotten complaints, but no formal requests to move books. When questions have been raised about materials in the library, they usually are resolved with a discussion, she said. 
“Fortunately, my whole district has been very supported by our community,” Short said. 
One conversation centered on the classic Mark Twain novel Huckleberry Finn and its inclusion of the n-word. She explained to the concerned patron the book’s importance in America’s literary history, and that the discomfort the reader felt was part of the point. 
“She understood why we had that book in our collection,” Short said, “and kind of became an advocate for the library after that.”

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)Wisconsin lawmakers are exploring ways to make it easier for school districts to consolidate as they face  declining enrollment and financial difficulties.
There are 421 school districts in the state of Wisconsin and about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment. According to preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction, enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students, representing a nearly 2% decrease from last year’s estimate. Total enrollment across school districts is about 759,800 this year. 
Reps. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said during an Assembly Education Committee public hearing Tuesday that declining enrollment is to blame for the financial troubles that schools are facing.
“The districts that are going to referendum all the time. It’s almost always because of declining enrollment. It just gets more expensive per student to educate those kids as the districts become smaller,” Kitchens said. “We’re not telling districts this is what you have to do or what you should do. We’re telling them this is an option for you to consider.” 
Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years. Kitchens pointed to estimates from the Wisconsin Department of Administration that the population in Wisconsin is projected to drop by 200,000 by 2050, noting it will be largely due to the state’s declining birth rate.
Wisconsin’s school funding system is based in part on per pupil numbers, meaning that if fewer students are enrolled schools receive decreased funding from the state, even if a district’s overall costs may not fall. 
Kitchens said that having 421 school districts is not going to be sustainable in the long term in Wisconsin and questioned whether there is another state that “on a per capita basis has that many” school districts. 
Kitchens said the issue shouldn’t be partisan. He noted that school consolidation is something that the 2019 Blue Ribbon Commission on Wisconsin school funding supported through its  recommendations.
“Many districts have used the referendum process to increase the property tax burden on the local residents to backfill the loss in state aid revenue,” Nedweski said. “Many others have seen them repeatedly fail as property taxpayers are unwilling to raise their taxes to increasingly fund empty schools.” She noted that a recent Marquette Law School Poll found that 57% of participants said they would vote against a referendum request. “There is no referendum that can be passed or law that can be signed to single-handedly reverse decades of birth rate declines to alleviate the stresses of declining enrollment in our schools. It’s clear that a more long-term solution is needed to address these demographic challenges because the status quo is not sustainable.” 
Wisconsin has had a record number of school districts go to referendum to help meet costs. But beyond declining enrollment, public school advocates say the burden on local taxpayers asked to fund their schools through referendum has grown mostly due to the fact that state investments in public schools have not kept pace with inflation for almost two decades. In the most recent state budget, Wisconsin lawmakers provided additional special education funding, but opted not to provide any increase in general aid, leaving increased costs to fall on property taxpayers.
State Superintendent Tom McCarthy noted during the hearing that Wisconsin is currently spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. He noted that about 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, and that percentage used to be around 35%. He also said the conversation about declining enrollment and costs had to include the acknowledgement that school districts’ revenue limits have been frozen at different points over the last decade, prohibiting school districts from raising more funds unless they go to referendum to ask voters.
Nedweski said the bills would be useful tools and incentives for districts facing decisions about whether to consolidate.
“Buildings do not educate kids, teachers do,” Nedweski said. “By finding efficiencies through voluntary consolidation, districts will be able to reduce overhead and direct resources to the classrooms so that our students can continue to receive a quality education, while taxpayers receive relief on their property tax bills.”
The package of bills would take a number of steps to encourage districts to explore consolidation, including providing financial incentives.
School districts already receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. 
AB 644 would increase that additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2026, 2027 and 2028 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. The last six years would be the same as under current law. 
Kitchens said that he thought most school districts would be able to decide within a year whether consolidation is something that they want to pursue. 
“I’m very open in the future to extending that deadline, but I think to get it passed, we need to put a sunset on it, so we’re doing three years,” Kitchens said. 
Dee Pattack, executive director of the Wisconsin School Administrators Alliance, noted that the inclusion of 2026 won’t really be useful for school districts since districts that want to consolidate have missed the opportunity to do so if they haven’t decided by now for next year. She also suggested that lawmakers look at spreading out  the additional aid more gradually, saying that dropping aid from $2,000 to $150 per student creates a cliff.
Kitchens said he would look at amending the timeline included in the bill. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) noted that decisions about consolidation can be emotional and personal for communities. 
“Public schools are the heart of our communities, oftentimes in rural communities, especially. They’re one of the largest employers. It’s where you have the most celebrations. There’s athletic events that are important to everyone in the communities and so this decision of consolidation is deeply complex. It’s personal for a lot of school districts,” Hong said. 
Hong, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor, questioned whether lawmakers had considered just leaving the decisions on consolidation up to local communities altogether, noting that Wisconsin law favors local control of schools. 
“That’s why it’s voluntary. That’s why we’re offering these tools. It is not mandatory. We know it’s going to be difficult,” Kitchens said, adding that Door County used to be full of one-room school houses until there was a consolidation in 1960. “When they consolidated that and formed Southern Door [County] School District, people were out there with pitchforks. It’s always going to be difficult, but we have to look at the future and what it’s going to be.” 
Kitchens noted that districts are not “clamoring” to consolidate and that the option exists as a last resort for most. 
“There are a few that are, and you’ll hear from at least one of them today that really have reached that point where they know it’s necessary,” Kitchens said. “We’re not hearing districts begging for this.” 
Joe Green, district administrator and director of special education for the Greenwood School District, and Chris Lindner, superintendent for the Loyal School District, testified about the rural school districts’ journey of consolidation, which their school boards are focused on getting done by July 1, 2028. They said it has been an emotional journey as people are attached to their schools and communities, but that it could be the best option for them. 
“It might be the thing that gets us over the hump to consolidation,” Green said of the new legislative proposal. “It might be the funding that our two districts need to put a good plan in front of our communities. It might allow us to do some small projects to make consolidation smoother. There may be small construction, or things that we need to do to retrofit buildings, if that’s the way that our facility studies go. There’s a million different scenarios out there on what consolidation can look like. But without that funding, I mean, honestly, with our two districts $150 bucks a kid is $100,000 — not gonna do much with that… it’s just not going to do much.”
Green said the districts already share bus service and that 50% of their co–curricular activities are shared. They said that the schools began sharing students and staff due to their difficulty finding adequate staff to deliver instruction in rural Clark County in central Wisconsin. 
Lindner said that consolidation could help open up more opportunities for students. “We do drama together. If we did not, we would have five to six students that would not be able to do drama because, you know, can’t do it with five or six kids,” he said. 
Lindner said consolidation could also help save money.
“Our taxpayers are paying a lot of money for our operating referendums,” he said. “We tell communities if we do not start working together more, then we will be losing.”
AB 645 would instruct DPI to provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. 
Another bill, AB 647, would have DPI provide four-year grants of up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade to school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. 
Felzkowski said that whole-grade sharing is a step before consolidation.
“It lets them test the waters if they ever want to move to full consolidation,” Felzkowski said, adding that middle and high schools may be able to provide more class offerings, including advanced coursework, to students with grade sharing.
AB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to  address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place.
AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. 
McCarthy of DPI noted at the hearing that there are already several legal and mechanical supports in place to encourage consolidation, and that even with those, the last major consolidation that took place was on July 1, 2018. Two K-8 districts merged to become the Holy Hill Area School District in Richfield. 
McCarthy of DPI said the slate of bills being proposed are “largely building from past efforts to support and to incentivize consolidation” and that the agency doesn’t view them as “a brand new door that’s being opened up” to solve problems.
The final bill in the package, AB 646, would study what changes should be made to Wisconsin’s school districts. Under it, DPI would hire a contractor to conduct a study of Wisconsin’s school districts that looks at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. 
McCarthy said the agency is most excited about this final proposal.  He said it is similar to what Vermont has done and addresses some of the factors that are important to consider when consolidating. 
The study would culminate in recommendations for changes to school district boundaries, a survey on the conditions of school district facilities across the state, information on the current and 10-year projection of the population of school-age children in each district and recommendations for school district consolidations that promote efficiency, are geographically feasible and economically viable. 
“We probably owe it to our school partners to take a long look at what are the right geographical boundaries here,” McCarthy said. “As we’re thinking about how to manage this stuff, it might be a good moment in time to slow down and think about how do we sync some of these things up to be a more effective patchwork of schools that are serving our communities?”

As more tax cuts loom, disparate counties struggle with how to pay for elections, roads, weed control, fire trucks and even a morgue.
The post Wyoming’s property tax relief cuts deep for some, but not all  appeared first on WyoFile .","Park County’s real estate market caught fire amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as people from around the country flocked to this rural refuge. Buyers snapped up properties and sent the median sale price for a single-family home rocketing from $286,000 in 2020 to $415,000 in 2022.
As values soared, the average homeowner in this northwestern Wyoming county saw their tax bills jump over 60% in three years.
“Taxpayers tell me, ‘We don’t mind paying our fair share of property taxes,’” Park County Assessor Terry Call told the local Republican Party in January. “The problem for all of us taxpayers is the past few years haven’t been fair at all.”
State lawmakers heard homeowners’ concerns and responded with new and expanded tax breaks. This year, Wyoming’s property tax revenue shrank by about $250 million — with the Department of Revenue attributing roughly 80% of that drop, $198.5 million, to relief bills passed in 2024 and 2025. Funding collected for K-12 education dropped by $185 million, while special districts are receiving $12.7 million less than last year.
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions.” Terry Call, Park County Assessor  
In Park County, the local school districts, county and city governments, community college, hospitals, fire departments, cemeteries and other special districts will collect about $61 million in property taxes this year. That’s down from the record $76.3 million assessed in 2023, though still up from the roughly $45 million billed in 2021.
Call has heard a handful of taxpayers express worries about how the recent reductions will impact schools and other government services, but, he said last month, “very few have said they’re not going to take the exemption because of their concerns.”
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions,” Call said.
The state’s one-size-fits-all approach to property tax relief is playing out with notably different results, depending on the county and government entity. Some communities haven’t experienced much belt tightening, or they’ve found creative ways to collect replacement revenue. But others are eyeing cuts to everything from road maintenance to public safety to elections.

A few hundred miles to the south, in Carbon County, Sue Jones isn’t taking a property tax exemption that saved her $380 last year. As a county commissioner, Jones is witnessing the kind of cuts that resulted from putting that $380 back in her pocket. 
Ostensibly, the property tax cuts are designed to prevent Wyoming residents from having to pay more in annual costs, Jones said. But cutting property taxes has come at the expense of access to services like the library, museum and senior center in her county. 
Wyoming’s tax system, Jones said, “might need a little tweaking now and again, but you don’t just cut the legs out from under it. That’s pretty much what’s happened, and it’s a ripple effect.”
The outlier 
During a Joint Revenue Committee meeting in Gillette this spring, Campbell County Commissioner Scott Clem took the mic to critique the Legislature’s aggressive, and often confusing, approach to property taxes. Clem served in the state’s House of Representatives from 2015 to 2020. Now a county commissioner, he has serious misgivings about this year’s property tax cuts, even though his county has been insulated from the pain.

Much of Campbell County’s property tax haul comes from mineral property taxes, with coal, oil and gas production making up about 78% of the county’s roughly $4.8 billion in assessed valuation, or taxable value. 
Less reliant on residential property taxes than other counties, the Campbell County Commission passed a $145 million budget this fiscal year, nearly identical to last year’s. The Gillette City Council approved a $151 million budget, similar to the previous year. And the Campbell County School District passed a $323 million budget, a 4% increase that included the largest year-over-year jump in teacher pay in years. 
“We in Campbell County, in particular, we’re just an outlier because of our mineral wealth,” Clem said.
Campbell County has seen its assessed valuation — its taxable value of all properties that determines the value of a mill levy — drop over the last few years as coal production continues to decline. Since 2016, when hundreds of coal miners were laid off, local governments have reduced their workforce through attrition and built up reserves in case the economic bottom falls out. As long as coal is being mined, that will continue to keep property taxes lower for everybody in Campbell County, Clem said.
‘Hardship’ counties
Other counties aren’t so fortunate. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers considered, but ultimately rejected proposals to backfill local government budgets for eight so-called “hardship” counties. Big Horn, Crook, Goshen, Hot Springs, Niobrara, Platte, Washakie and Weston raise the lowest amount of revenue from property taxes among the state’s 23 counties. With no money from the state to make up for cuts, Big Horn County has responded to the drop in funds by imposing a hiring freeze.
“We’ll suffer the effects of this for years to come,” Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley said.
“At [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”Bruce Jolley, Big Horn County Commissioner 
Some of Big Horn County’s roughly 65 employees could be laid off in coming years to offset lost revenue. Although commissioners hope to avoid such job cuts, Jolley said, that could lead to further reductions in other areas, such as the county fair and emergency services.
The county commission also slashed its library budget from $350,000 the previous fiscal year to $280,000. In response, the library system cut employee benefits, trimmed operating hours and closed branches in Frannie and Deaver.  

Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley 
This year, Jolley doesn’t expect the county to be able to afford to crush gravel, and after an October rainstorm washed away some roads, the county’s gravel stockpile will shrink. Asphalt roads could also suffer, raising costs if maintenance is deferred to the point roads need to be replaced.
“I’m glad people are getting cuts on their property tax, I’m glad that people are getting a break,” Jolley said. “But, at [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”
Unfunded mandates? 
One hardship county, Goshen, now has less money to respond to new laws passed by the Legislature that require more labor. Following the raft of property tax relief measures, Goshen suffered a nearly $2.6 million drop in tax dollars collected for various local budgeting entities. 
In response, county departments were asked to cut budgets by 8.25%. For Assessor Debbi Surratt, that meant eliminating a position her office had been trying to fill. 
“It gets a little bit tough in counties like ours, where we have no minerals,” Surratt said. “We are pretty reliant just on our taxpayers to keep things going.” 
To avoid cutting staff in her department, County Clerk Mary Feagler looked to consolidate and transition from 11 polling places to three voting centers, saving her office around $30,000, or 20%, per election cycle. But community pushback prompted county commissioners to nix the idea and ask Feagler to try to cut staff before closing polling locations. Feagler, however, said she doesn’t have staff she could get rid of, especially with an election year approaching. 
These challenges are arriving just as the workload is increasing due to stricter election laws passed this year. The new statewide measures require voters to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship upon registration, adding more work for county clerks and election staff. The change requires more training for election judges, too. Judges must feel confident turning away voters, even their neighbors, if the voters fail to provide necessary ID, she said. 
Replacing precinct-by-precinct polling locations with vote centers would have both cut costs and increased her office’s ability to enforce the new rules, Feagler said. Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he “strongly opposed” the change in a September statement, and the county commission there ultimately voted to reject the proposal. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state, and it goes to local governments.”Gov. Mark Gordon
The true hardship from declining revenues, Surratt anticipates, will be felt over the next couple of years, when commissioners must make even tougher decisions about services. 
“The Legislature should do a better job of looking for other sources, not just putting a Band-Aid on it, and the [property tax] exemptions are just a Band-Aid,” Surratt said. “All they’ve done is muddied the water.”  Exemptions are often confusing for taxpayers to navigate, Surratt added.

Gov. Mark Gordon touched on the cascading impacts during an October town hall in Lander. 
“You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries,” Gordon told the audience. “And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate, the governor said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers that even a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee appeared confused when he said: “The state doesn’t need that property tax.”  
About 72% of property taxes this year went to public education — both K-12 schools and community colleges — with the rest earmarked for county and city levies and special districts for services such as road and bridge work, sewer lines, firefighting, recreation, museums and libraries, according to a Department of Revenue report released this year.
Gordon worries that “by cutting ourselves so close to the bone,” the state is stripping away extra layers of protection that could insulate it if the economy sours. 
More room to cut

In more flush counties, where soaring property values pinched longtime homeowners, elected leaders would like deeper cuts. 
Powell City Councilman Troy Bray — who wants to see the elimination of all residential property taxes — believes the 25% exemption has helped local residents stay in their homes while causing little impact to governments.
The new exemptions and a 4% cap saved Powell taxpayers $101,500 this year. With an overall budget of around $25.6 million, Bray called the reduction an “almost inconsequential” percentage for the city.
In the 2026 election, Wyoming voters will decide on a ballot resolution to cut residential property taxes by 50% — which would be in addition to the 25% exemption already on the books, according to the Legislative Service Office. Bray believes a 50% exemption wouldn’t have a substantial impact on governments, either, contending there are always places to cut before touching necessary services like police and fire departments.
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling.’ “Troy Bray, Powell City Council
Bray doesn’t heed the lobbyists and politicians talking about how “horrible” the effects of property tax relief efforts will be. 
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling,’” Bray said. “Guess what? The sky didn’t fall.”
The impacts in Park County have been uneven, as some entities are much more dependent on property taxes than others.
The Park County government missed out on $2.18 million as a result of the tax relief, according to the assessor’s figures. County commissioners reduced their spending on roads and bridges and cut grants to outside agencies to help balance the $37.6 million budget.
At the Park County Weed and Pest District, the legislative relief reduced revenue by about $182,000 within a $2.38 million budget. That’s about a 7.5% hit.
Overall, the district plans to spend about $600,000 less than it did last year. Among other cuts, Weed and Pest Supervisor Josh Shorb said they slashed a seasonal weed-spraying crew from 12 to eight members, stopped spraying weeds along county roads and ended their support of a hazardous waste collection day.

The district also reduced incentives to landowners and farmers to spray for weeds and pests. For example, instead of covering half the cost of herbicides targeting Canada thistle and Russian knapweed, the district dropped its share to 30%. The district also ended a $2-per-acre subsidy that helped sugar beet growers battle the beet leafhopper and reduced a subsidy for fall field spraying from $10 to $7 per acre.
“We really pulled our horns in. Had to,” Shorb said.
The pullback is relative, as the district will still receive about $225,000 more in property taxes than it did in 2021, before Park County’s big surge in home values. 
Shorb said the tax bump allowed the district to expand its cost share programs, catch up on deferred building maintenance and replace aging vehicles and rental equipment. Another chunk was eaten up by inflation, he said, with wages, insurance, trucks and ATVs all rising in cost. In some cases, “it was like ‘dollar in, dollar out’ almost,” Shorb said.
He worries that further tax cuts will cause the district to miss invasive weeds like medusahead, ventenata or Palmer amaranth, or leave it unable to respond to an outbreak.
“I’ve been in this job for 25 years, and this has been the most stressful year by far,” Shorb said, noting additional cuts at the federal level. “All I think about is, ‘How am I going to pay for this? How are we going to do this? What are our priorities?’”
In Teton County, where soaring property values also filled county coffers, the current belt tightening has county commissioners hesitating on building a new morgue. When Dr. Brent Blue needs to move a body from the operating table to refrigerator storage at the Teton County morgue, he uses a jerry-rigged hospital lift fitted with zip ties and climbing webbing to hoist the body bag.
It’s one of many challenges the coroner faces because of the lackluster facility. A repurposed two-car garage previously used by Teton County Weed and Pest, the morgue didn’t have a drain until 2016. The coroner had to squeegee blood and tissue from autopsies out into the driveway.
“This place was literally toxic,” Blue said during a recent tour. “It still pretty much is.”
The coroner asked county commissioners for $270,000 to start designing and planning a new morgue, which will cost millions to build. Commissioners balked given budget challenges, but ultimately agreed to spend an initial $95,000 on the project. 
Overall, Teton County’s general fund lost $6 million in revenue from property tax exemptions in 2025. The county’s loss accounted for just 14% of the total $44 million in tax revenue, spread across a variety of tax collecting entities, exempted for Teton County residential property owners. The Elk Refuge Sewer District saw the smallest hit, losing $33, while public school education accounts combined took a nearly $34 million hit. Other large revenue losses included $2.3 million for the hospital, $767,150 for Teton County Weed and Pest and $205,437 for the fire district serving the Teton Village ski resort. 
Other counties, like Sheridan and Park, responded to reductions in revenue by imposing hiring freezes. Sheridan County also spent about $1.26 million from its cash reserves and slashed spending by up to 20% in each department to make up for an estimated $1.3 million in lost property tax revenue.
A mixed bag
In Cheyenne and Laramie County, business growth is helping stabilize budgets, but also straining public safety services typically funded by property taxes. 
This year, the city of Cheyenne annexed a business park, which completely offset a potential loss of $1.8 million in tax revenue. Laramie County has yet to make any major changes or staff cuts so far, as well.

However, the Laramie County Fire Authority is facing a roughly $500,000 reduction in its operating budget this year, down to about $1.77 million. The cut forced Fire Chief Jason Caughey to place all capital projects and equipment replacement on hold. The reduced budget must now strictly cover salaries and maintain the existing fleet and eight stations. 
Caughey warned that further cuts could reduce 365-day staffing at three stations to only one. 
As a special district, the firefighting service is funded solely through property taxes and receives no sales tax revenue. The district’s ability to levy taxes is restricted by a state statute written in 1947 that sets fire protection at three mills. (For each mill assessed, Wyomingites pay $9.50 for every $100,000 their property is worth.) Though this part of the statute has not been updated since, Caughey said fire apparatus costs have tripled since 2013, and Laramie County’s services have expanded to include things like emergency medical services. 
Since 2011, the fire district’s call volume has more than quadrupled, rising from approximately 450 calls in 2011 to a projected 1,950 calls this year, with 72% of current calls being for medical services.

At the same time, Cheyenne and Laramie County are leaning on new solar and wind farms and massive data centers to backfill lost revenue from property tax relief. But Caughey said his department lacks funding to support the specialized training required to handle emergencies at such facilities. 
“Those are very large facilities that have inherent risks associated with them,” he said. “Those weren’t there over the last 30, 40, 50 years.”
Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins described the impact of the tax cuts as an “opportunity loss” of $1.8 million that prevented the city from hiring essential personnel, including additional firefighters, police officers and street maintenance staff. As demand for city services grows, the city needs more money, not less, to fund those services, he said.
‘It adds up’
Carbon County is enormous — nearly 8,000 square miles encompassing everything from ranches near the Colorado state line to Saratoga’s outdoorsy attractions along the North Platte River to Rawlins on Interstate 80, some 150 miles west of Cheyenne.
In a county that large, there are a lot of services. So when Carbon County faced a property tax revenue drop of more than $900,000, Commissioner Jones said, she and other county commissioners had to make difficult cuts. 
Counties are statutorily mandated to fund services such as road maintenance and the operation of a county jail, which leaves certain items off the chopping block. But the commissioners and staff chipped away where they could. They reduced courthouse operating hours, left positions vacant and went without magnesium chloride treatment on roads for dust abatement. 
The commission also imposed major cuts on what it calls outside agencies, which includes services it’s not mandated to fund. That meant eliminating funding for economic development, slashing the library system budget by 53% and making painful cuts to senior services and the museum. 
Jones felt there was confusion about what property taxes actually fund. After seeing the impact firsthand, she’s opting to decline the tax exemption that saved her $380 — a small gesture to show that the services her tax dollars support are valuable, she said. 
“I also live in a fire district, in a school district, in a soil conservation district, in the weed and pest district,” she said. “I have family buried in the cemetery district. I have a local library. I have a local senior center. Seven things that my little $380, with everybody else’s, pays for.
“I think, for those seven things and my $380, I’m getting a really good deal.”

Dick Cheney's passing functions as a Rorschach test for our ability to embrace political nuance, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Cheney — or — What’s in a name? appeared first on WyoFile .","The mere mention of the Cheney name evokes powerful reactions from Wyomingites. It seems that nobody can discuss that name dispassionately.

Opinion

The Cheney name, instead, is laden with polarizing political overtones that issue from a part of the brain that cannot be objective, that fixates upon the bright shiny objects of our modern civil discourse. This, in my opinion, reflects poorly on ourselves as citizens, and says little about the Cheneys.
The recent passing of Dick Cheney re-animated this strange phenomenon. His critics came out of the woodwork to dance on his grave and vilify him with their voices on social media. Scant indeed were those willing to acknowledge Dick Cheney’s considerable contributions to the state and nation that he loved.
Marc Antony’s funeral oration in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” seems fitting to remember here. “The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.” We are too prone to focus on the negative rather than the good when we talk about the Cheneys.
I worked with Congressman Dick Cheney and his capable staff in the 80s, when I served in the Wyoming Governor’s Office. Cheney enjoyed universal respect for the way he represented Wyoming in Congress. His political acumen and his ability to “work across the aisle” with Democrats to get things done for the Cowboy State as our lone congressman were particularly valuable.
Back then, Wyoming was the envy of the nation for the effectiveness of our delegation — Cheney and Sens. Al Simpson and Malcolm Wallop. They left big bootprints on history. Cheney even wrote a book, “Kings of the Hill,” a historical blueprint for how Congress can work when guided by noble personalities and true statesmen.
I’m wondering aloud how a name that was once solid gold in Wyoming could, in such a short time, draw such bile from people he once represented so ably. For a state that prides itself on a long memory and sense of history, we have a very limited perspective when it comes to the Cheney name.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Don’t misunderstand, I hold the entire Bush the Younger administration, Vice President Cheney included, culpable for the disastrous Iraq War. That misadventure did a lot of damage. But it does not erase from my mind Cheney’s productive years as a fine legislator, nor does it diminish his contributions to Wyoming.
Those who posthumously vilify Dick Cheney suffer from a very selective myopia if they can’t acknowledge his stature in Wyoming politics. That says more about them than it does about him.
The same can be said about the political trajectory of another Cheney, Dick’s daughter Liz, who was elected to her father’s seat in Congress. Liz Cheney’s early terms in Congress were marked by her impressive legislative record and her almost meteoric rise to a leadership position in the House GOP.
I ran against Liz in the GOP primary in 2018, and my ass-whuppin’ at the polls gave me an object lesson in the potency and charisma of the Cheney name.
Liz Cheney’s future in Wyoming politics seemed limitless in those days. She was our fair-haired cowgirl, and folks in the Big Empty adored her. During Trump’s first term, Liz voted with the president over 90% of the time.
That changed in a heartbeat when Liz broke ranks with Trump and voted to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Her vote, which in my opinion was an act of incredible political courage and patriotism, came at a high cost. Liz lost her seat in the next primary and became a pariah in the state that once revered her.
If Liz Cheney’s fall from grace proved anything, it proved that the Trump name is more important in Wyoming than the Cheney name. And I find that appalling.
For Trump’s name to replace the Cheney name at the apex of the Wyoming political pantheon says less about those names than it does about us as citizens.
And this turn of events calls to mind another Marc Antony quote from “Julius Caesar” when he says, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., one of the state’s wealthiest, best-known politicians.","Dan Osborn speaks with a reporter at a Lincoln bar on Oct. 9. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In a downtown bar on O Street in the capital city, Dan Osborn drank a 16-ounce draft Coors Banquet Beer. 
During a sit-down interview with the Nebraska Examiner at O’Rourke’s Tavern, the occasional patron walked up to Osborn to tell him they support his bid against U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb. Some said they hope he pulls off an upset that would cause political shockwaves nationally. Osborn took a swig between answers and joked that his opponent would probably criticize him for drinking.  
The former Omaha union leader and registered nonpartisan said his second Senate bid in three years has taught him the system is “rigged.” 
“Trump was right, the system’s rigged … but it’s rigged by the big people and the people with the money that have the influence,” Osborn said. 
He means people like Ricketts, his likely opponent in the 2026 general election, a former two-term governor and the face of a prominent family of donors to conservative causes who steers the state’s dominant political operation. 
Osborn, who lost by six percentage points in 2024 to Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, has built a brand on his Navy veteran hat and flannel shirts, fed partly by hosting meet-and-greets in bars like this one across Nebraska. 
The Osborn campaign has held roughly two dozen such town halls over the past few months, reminding many of his campaign’s approach in 2024. Osborn prides himself on ‘old school politics,’ hearing from Nebraskans directly, where they live, and asking them what they want from Washington. 
“I would say the number one issue that people talk about first is the economy and the cost of everything right now,” Osborn said. 
He said he thinks his campaign should connect with people who’ve given up on politics, people who shrug their shoulders when a campaign ad comes on, who think the system wasn’t built for them and who might want better.
His closer-than-expected race against Fischer made Osborn a national political name, and his style of populism — focused on the working class, union organizing and kitchen table issues — has been talked about as a possible way out of the bipartisan screaming match that surrounds most political races. 
Republicans are taking him more seriously this time. The National Republican Senatorial Committee started its 2026 Nebraska race by running digital ads saying a social media account with ties to Osborn had liked gay porn and criticized him for his stance on the federal government shutdown. Osborn has argued Democrats were right to seek congressional leverage for extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits to keep health insurance premiums from sharply increasing.

Many in the public first learned of Osborn in 2021, when he lead an 11-week strike of Nebraska Kellogg’s workers as the company pushed for concessions in a new union contract despite the food company posting record profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kellogg’s workers secured a five-year contract that gives wage increases, a path to eliminating a two-tiered wage system and enhanced benefits.
Osborn was later fired by Kellogg’s management for allegedly watching Netflix while on the job, a step he viewed as retaliation for leading the strike. In the years since, Kellogg’s has announced it would close the Omaha plant by 2026. Fischer’s team at the time blamed Osborn for the loss of local jobs. Union leaders defended Osborn’s work and said they were working to keep the plant open.
Ricketts’ campaign constantly calls Osborn a “fake independent” and repeatedly points to Osborn receiving donations and support from Democrats as examples of what they see as his ties to the state’s largest minority party. 
Opponents hammer him for using ActBlue, an online fundraising tool that promotes itself as a tool for helping elect Democrats. They also point to his tacit support from Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb, who has said Democrats want to break Republicans’ hold on Nebraska politics.
Osborn and his campaign manager, John Dolan, laugh off the critiques — describing it as “comical” that the best that the Ricketts team came up with is calling Osborn “fake.”

Osborn said he uses ActBlue because he couldn’t also get on the Republican-aligned fundraising tool WinRed. Osborn added that he viewed ActBlue like PayPal or GoFundMe, as little more than a platform for donating political money, and said he doesn’t take stock in the tool being “associated with Democrats.”
Dolan, at the bar, said team Ricketts can “read into it all they f— want,” while previews of the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles flashed on TV. 
Some nonpartisan candidates in other states who have followed Osborn’s 2024 approach are avoiding using ActBlue to sidestep being associated with the Democratic Party. The fundraising platform changed its rules this year to allow use by some Independent and nonpartisan candidates. 
Osborn said he could’ve done the same, but the “alternative would be to not raise the money we need to win.” 
“You have two choices, and you can’t have the other one,” Osborn said. 
On the campaign trail, Osborn sometimes confuses Democrats and Republicans because of the way he talks about President Donald Trump. Osborn has previously said he supported Trump’s stance on China, the border and “draining the swamp.” Like many labor leaders and former labor leaders, he holds mixed views on Trump’s tariffs, he told NBC News.
He has also criticized Trump for his tax and spending bill, aka the “big, beautiful bill,” which he said would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy “off the backs of people.” 
Trump’s major legislative victory remains unpopular with Americans. Osborn says he plans to campaign on what the law actually does, which he says hurts working people. He says it cements tax cuts from the first Trump administration that primarily benefit high earners, while giving some new temporary tax breaks to workers earning less.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polling showed about 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump for the current rate of inflation, and more than 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government. A poll from NBC News indicated that two-thirds of voters say Trump has not lived up to their expectations on the economy and cost of living.
The federal government has been experiencing the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which could soon end. Osborn told Fox News Host Jessica Tarlov on her podcast that he supported the shutdown. The Ricketts’ campaign, and the NRSC criticized Osborn’s backing of the shutdown as another example of him siding with Democrats. The NRSC called him “another Democrat lap dog.” 
While Osborn said he doesn’t know everything about the shutdown, he said he would have fought for the  insurance subsidies, the tax credits at the heart of Senate Democrats’ efforts to keep the government closed until they force at least a vote on extending them.  
He also told the Lincoln Journal Star last month that the shutdown was “in line with what I’ve been saying all along,” that “we’re in this two-party doom loop.”

Until recently, Republican congressional leadership had expressed little interest in negotiating on the health care subsidies during the shutdown. Osborn said he’s relieved the shutdown appears to be headed for an end, but he remains concerned about rising healthcare costs. 
Osborn said the role of the federal government is to protect its citizens, which should include access to “access to freaking hospitals when we’re sick, because there’s no Democrat or Republican in the back of an ambulance.”
On the campaign trail, Trump has promised “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 but start decreasing in 2024.  
Osborn said he supports stronger border security. He ran an ad in the previous cycle offering to help Trump build his border wall. He said Trump has done a good job securing the border but he doesn’t like how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Trump have been making light of enforcement. 
ICE and other government agencies have used online memes to gain attention and rile up a part of the GOP base. Homeland Security, for instance, posted an AI-generated photo of a cornfield this year with ears wearing ICE hats and a caption of “Coming Soon: The Cornhusker Clink.” 
Trump posted “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning” with an edited photo of himself depicted as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now.
“Even if you think it’s funny, that is not professional coming from the White House,” Osborn said. 
Nebraska, like the rest of the country, has seen an increase in immigration detention activity, including an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha earlier this year. The state expects to begin receiving federal migrant detainees in the state’s new immigration detention facility in McCook earlier this month. 
Osborn said Trump — like most administrations before him — isn’t doing the comprehensive immigration reform that’s humane and that’s going to fix the problem “because it’s an economic issue.”
He has argued for months that the “big four meat packers” benefit from having a “wide open border with no immigration policy, because they can exploit the labor, enrich themselves, and then they donate millions of dollars to candidates so they won’t do anything about it.” Trump in recent days also attacked the meatpacking industry on social media, posts applauded by many in Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation, including Fischer.
Democrats have talked about Osborn as potentially offering them a roadmap back to national power and relevance, based on his outreach to many of the working-class voters party surveys show it lost touch with. 
But he doesn’t think about how his campaign fits into the bigger picture of politics. He said he “just wakes up every day and goes to work.”
People around Osborn said they see the bigger picture. Dolan, his campaign manager, said voters are tired of “the same caricature of people getting elected into government and then doing nothing.” 
Osborn said he has heard from many who say “the only way we’re going to get anything done in the country is by electing independents.”
The Osborn campaign says it plans to spend a lot of time next year on college campuses as it tries to figure out the “puzzle” of voter turnout. Osborn’s team is focused on turnout because midterm elections often have lower turnout than in presidential election years, and Nebraska’s smaller population means smaller increases in turnout can have a significant impact in close races.
“​​Ricketts is going to be on your TV and your radio,” Osborn said. “I’m going to hopefully be in your living room, in your business, and having a beer and chatting it up.”
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)When a prison built in the 1800s is still housing people in 2025 with the same aging infrastructure, we have to be honest, the system is broken. Wisconsin’s prisons have been in crisis for years, and for the first time in a long time, we’re seeing a small but important step toward change. 
Gov. Tony Evers recently received bipartisan approval to overhaul Wisconsin’s aging prison system and close the outdated Green Bay and Waupun prisons. The overhaul strategy includes a $15 million project investment and outlines a four-year process to reduce the number of beds, modernize facilities, and shift the focus toward rehabilitation and safety. That’s progress, but 2029 is too far away, and Evers’ plan lacks the kind of decarceration measures needed to actually reduce the prison population and make Wisconsin safer. 
The reality inside our prisons doesn’t have four years to wait. People are dying. Staff are exhausted. Families are breaking under the weight of a system that punishes more than it prepares people to come home. Every delay costs lives and wastes taxpayer dollars that could be used to help people rebuild instead of being locked away. 
I know this firsthand because I lived it. I spent part of my incarceration inside Green Bay Correctional Facility, one of the oldest and most overcrowded prisons in Wisconsin. The facility was built in 1898 with a design capacity of about 17,000 people statewide, yet Wisconsin’s prison population has hovered above 22,000 for years. That means thousands of people crammed into cells meant for far fewer. Walking those halls, you can feel the age of the place, the air thick with humidity, the bitter cold in winter, and the lack of ventilation that makes it hard to breathe. The walls are cracking, the infrastructure is failing, and the environment itself strips people of their dignity. 
Those conditions don’t make anyone safer. They don’t prepare people for reentry. They create desperation, both for both the incarcerated and the staff working inside. The best way to ensure a safer Wisconsin is to get the people who are ready to reenter society out of our prisons and into reentry. Overcrowded and understaffed prisons overtax our correctional officers and make prisons unsafe for officers and incarcerated people. In addition, understaffing makes it harder to ensure that everyone gets the programming that they need. The Federal First Step Act and CARES Act Home Confinement have both proved that bringing the right people back early can result in lower recidivism, better public safety and safer and more effective prisons. 










If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. ... Real reform means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 


I was one of the many people affected by Wisconsin’s Truth in Sentencing law, which eliminated parole and early release. That law has kept countless people behind bars longer than necessary, removing the hope and incentive that parole once provided.
If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. Real reform means reducing the number of people behind bars, ending excessive revocations, expanding reentry programs, and investing in housing, treatment, and mental health care. It means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 
According to the Prison Policy Initiative, Wisconsin imprisons about 663 people per 100,000 residents, far more than Minnesota (173) or Illinois (341). Despite years of promises to reform, the state’s prison population has remained between 21,000 and 23,000 people for nearly two decades. 
Nearly 40% of new admissions each year come from revocations, not new crimes, meaning thousands are sent back to prison for breaking supervision rules like missing curfew, losing housing, or failing a drug test. That’s roughly 4,000 to 5,000 people every year, based on Department of Corrections data. I lead a statewide Smart Justice campaign focused on ending these excessive revocations, because it’s one of the biggest drivers of mass incarceration in Wisconsin. 
Add to that the worst racial disparity in the country. Black residents are imprisoned at 11 times the rate of white residents, according to the Sentencing Project, and it’s clear that our problem isn’t just old buildings. It’s old thinking. Reducing prison beds without changing these policies is like draining a bathtub while leaving the faucet running. Until we reform supervision, expand early release and invest in reentry and community support, the system will keep refilling itself. 
Closing prisons built in the 1800s is a step in the right direction, but it has to come with urgency and intention. We can’t keep reacting; we have to start transforming. The same energy that went into passing this plan must go into implementing it quickly and with input from the people most affected by it, those who have lived behind those walls, their families and the communities most affected by incarceration. 
As we head into a new election season, this issue must be front and center for every candidate running for governor. Wisconsin deserves leaders who will move us forward, not just talk about reform, but act on it. The next administration should be judged on whether it has the courage to close outdated prisons, expand second chances, and build a system rooted in rehabilitation, dignity, and justice. 
Gov. Evers was right when he said, “We’ve got to get this damned thing done.” But getting it done means more than moving money; it means moving with purpose. Justice reform isn’t about buildings; it’s about people. 
Wisconsin’s motto is Forward. It’s time for our justice system and our next governor to finally live up to that.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as a co-chair to promote natural gas as a route to long-term energy reliability as renewable energy sources are built out, the organization announced Tuesday.
The organization promotes moving away from coal burning plants and using natural gas to reliably support solar and wind power generation. Touted as advocates for an “all of the above” energy profile, the group is expanding their reach into the commonwealth to promote gas power alongside renewable energy in hopes to bring down utility bills while cutting emissions, despite the commonwealth’s plan to eventually eliminate fossil fuels.
“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,”  McAuliffe said in a statement. 
McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. 
The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said. 
Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.
Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.
Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.
In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.
Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”
McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050. Virginia is also one of the largest energy importers in the country and is facing a demand crisis with hundreds of power thirsty data centers on the grid and more expected.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security is asking for more than 100 state troopers, in part to fill in patrol gaps left open because of a law enforcement surge in Memphis.
Safety Commissioner Jeff Long made a request for $43.5 million to fund 139 positions for Highway Patrol officers, supervisors and support staff during budget hearings with Gov. Bill Lee. Nearly 120 of those would be state troopers.
The personnel increase would make up more than half of Long’s overall budget increase of $84.2 million, which includes $19.7 million for a department “market adjustment” to cover inflation.
The department has 300 troopers working in Shelby County, roughly 100 per shift, as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, a combination of local, state and federal forces, including the Tennessee National Guard, which is the subject of a lawsuit.
The buildup could last for a year, although Lee has said he believes it could continue in some form “forever.”
Tennessee has more than 1,000 highway patrol officers and shifted about 25% of them to the Memphis buildup from other parts of the state. Troopers are being rotated in and out of Memphis and some adjustments will be made, Long added, but other counties are left to fill in for those working in Shelby County. 
“They’re not on skeleton crews because we’re not emptying certain areas. We’re pulling from the different areas across the state, as we do any other major operation,” Long told the Lookout. “It leaves (open shifts) somewhat for the people who are still there. That’s why we need more troopers too.”
Lee has made increasing trooper strength a priority during his two terms in office. His budget for this year added officers for a fifth straight year, roughly 370, though the state has had trouble filling all of the positions.
Asked about moving a large number of troopers to Memphis, Lee said Monday when he took office the state had about 800 troopers and was told the department needed 1,300  to be fully staffed.
The state shifted more troopers to Memphis over the past few years because of continual complaints about speeding and drag racing on the city’s interstates. 
Lee said he would evaluate whether the troopers Long requested are needed, but he added that the investment in law enforcement was necessary.
“It’s working,” Lee said. “We’re surged in Shelby County.” 
The governor called Long’s request more of a move to continue improving trooper staffing to reach his initial goal than a reaction to the Memphis buildup.

Chief Jay Johnson is accused of having a pole camera, owned and operated by the police department, installed at his Racine County home in late 2024. A 15-page criminal complaint states that Johnson put up the camera for personal use while he was in the process of divorcing his wife. 
The complaint also states that Johnson’s alleged personal use of the camera  violated the wishes and advice of Greenfield’s mayor, city attorney and members of the police department. In July, special agents from the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) attended a meeting held at Greenfield City Hall to discuss a months-long investigation with city officials. 
According to the complaint, the special agents “were advised that during an internal investigation of Chief Johnson, which was conducted earlier in 2025, investigators uncovered actions they deemed as possibly criminal in nature. Outside agencies were later contacted to investigate potentially criminal violations committed by Chief Johnson.” 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Interviews with Greenfield’s human resources director, mayor, city attorney and police department staff turned up statements  that Johnson wanted to use a tax-payer funded, police department-owned pole camera at his home in Wind Lake because of  “safety concerns stemming from his divorce,” according to the complaint. Mayor Michael Neitzke said Johnson claimed to have been attempting to get a retraining order against his wife “in part because she was dating a felon,” the complaint states. Johnson claimed to have experienced harassment including a white rose being left in his driveway. The chief’s restraining order was denied, the complaint states, after which he asked the mayor about installing a pole camera. “Mayor Neitzke advised agents that he did not understand the type of camera Chief Johnson was talking about and believed it was equivalent to a trail camera or Verizon-type camera,” the complaint states. 
The mayor gave Johnson the go-ahead to install the camera, but later began to reconsider the decision. Neitzke contacted city attorney Christopher Geary, who said Johnson shouldn’t install the camera “citing legal issues with its use for personal reasons.” Geary then contacted Johnson stating that “his divorce is not related to his job,” the criminal complaint states. Johnson’s reaction was reputedly bombastic, “‘I think it’s f-ing ludicrous,’ was the exact quote,” Geary wrote in an email to the mayor. 
Johnson tried to argue that what he wanted was no different from the security former Gov. Scott Walker received during the Act 10 protests, and that a prior Greenfield police chief also had home security. “I tried to explain the difference is that the threats in those situations stemmed from the person’s public employment and/or public policy positions, whereas this is, as I understand it, an entirely personal situation,” Geary wrote in the same email, which is featured in the criminal complaint. “He didn’t appreciate the distinction.” 
The mayor said he thought that was where the issue ended, and that Johnson hadn’t installed the camera. In December 2024, however, Greenfield Police Department  Captain Chuck Fletcher was asked by Johnson about installing the pole cameras, according to the complaint. Fletcher told the DCI special agents that he had known Johnson his entire career and “considers him a close friend.” Fletcher stated that he also knew Johnson’s wife, and didn’t consider her to be an angry or violent person. Johnson allegedly told Fletcher that he wanted to keep the camera installation “low key” and discrete. Fletcher then assigned Detective Scott Simons to handle the installation, and told investigators that he did not know that the city attorney had advised against it. 
The complaint states that Fletcher communicated the chief’s desire to be “low key” and quick about things to Simons. The detective said he was asked to “change the password for logging onto the camera, as all pole cameras have a general username and password,” according to the complaint. “The camera that was to be installed at the Defendant’s residence would have a unique username and password.” Although Greenfield’s pole cameras are owned and monitored by the police department, they are installed by We Energies technicians. A camera was taken down “from a closed drug investigation,” according to the complaint. Simons told another detective that it was “being installed in another county for another investigation.” The camera was eventually installed across the street from the chief’s home. 
Some time later, Greenfield Police Association president and detective Aaron Busche “found out by accident” about the chief’s personal camera. Busche keeps track of the department’s four pole cameras, which are listed on a whiteboard by number and location. Busche realized that the camera at Johnson’s home had no documented location. “Detective Busche was told by Detective Scott Simons that the camera was loaned to an outside agency for their investigation,” the complaint states. “Detective Busche was not told what agency the camera was loaned to.”
 
Criminal Complaint_1 - Johnson, Jay A_ 2025CF005150_ Johnson, Jay A._28099053_1
 
In the spring of 2025, Busche heard that there was video feed from the mystery camera, but then realized he couldn’t log in because the password had been changed. Busche then used a “backdoor process” to access the camera feed, and realized it was the chief’s home. During a meeting with acting chief Eric Lindstrom, Simons was asked to take the camera down. 
Johnson is accused of violating Greenfield PD’s standards of conduct by using department equipment for personal gain, and omitting or even falsifying information given to staff who carried out the camera’s installation. The criminal complaint also accuses Johnson of threatening behavior towards law enforcement. In late August, it states, a person attempting to disguise their voice called the police department saying, “Hello you f-ing pigs, revenge is sweet!” The dispatcher and Busche both recognized the voice as Johnson’s. 
Acting Chief Lindstrom had also filed a complaint against Johnson with the Oak Creek Police Department, accusing Johnson of threats and harassment over Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. One email copy says: “He’s on board, hold on tight!!!! Idiot and the ice princess will pay dearly. JJ DOJ is the man! Boom. God is good.” Another message says: “KL is on board. Friday meet with us. Ughhh. So unnecessary but he’s all in for me rn. HR and MN GOING DOWN!!!! EL is dirty so stay tuned. TY owe you!!!!” The criminal complaint states that “EL” is a reference to Eric Lindstrom who, like Busche, has also served on the Milwaukee-area team which investigates civilian deaths by police. 
The controversy raises questions about oversight of police surveillance technology, accountability for officers, and how problematic police officers climb the ranks. Community members in Milwaukee County have pushed for Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) local ordinances, which would provide more oversight and control of police surveillance tools.
Fox6 reported that a string of disciplinary issues going back to 2013 followed Chief Johnson. The news outlet obtained documents which described Johnson, who was a captain at the time, as having issues with “failing to own decisions and initiatives by administrative staff” or “engaging in inappropriate conversations with officers.” Johnson had been accused of sharing management-level discussions or information related to subordinates, and planning a “booze cruise” and other organized parties. 
A 2015 memo stated that “he can’t be allowed to supervise,” and in 2017 he signed a settlement to become Greenfield’s emergency management coordinator with the fire department, before becoming chief. Asked by Fox6 how Johnson became chief, Mayor Neitske redirected blame to the city’s Police and Fire Commission.

Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, criticizes Republicans for failing to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits in a stopgap funding measure on Nov. 10, 2025 on the Senate floor. (Screenshot from Youtube)After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.
“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”
The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.
Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.
“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said. 
While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S. 
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs. 
“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said. 
Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.
Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced. 
“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.
Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.

Founded in 2004 by brothers Charles and David Koch, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, describes itself as a grassroots advocacy organization that supports pro-growth policies, free markets, limited government, freedom and individual liberty. 
With the opening of its local chapter, Idaho became the 37th state with a brick-and-mortar state chapter, Americans for Prosperity announced in a press release. 
Jason Lehosit, who has three decades of campaign and policy experience in the Northwest, is serving as the Idaho state director of Americans for Prosperity.
Prior to taking on his new role, Lehosit most recently worked as the policy director for Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane.

“I’m excited to lead AFP-Idaho and support Idahoans getting engaged in grassroots efforts to magnify common sense and free market values across the state,” Lehosit said in a written statement. “Idaho’s on a great path, but we can’t take that for granted. We need to keep cutting red tape, reining in wasteful spending and protecting the values that make Idaho such a great place to live, work and raise a family.”
Although the Idaho chapter is new, Americans for Prosperity has held events and done work in Idaho previously. 
In August, Americans for Prosperity held a private breakfast event in Boise with U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to promote the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. Gov. Brad Little, Idaho House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits attended the Americans for Prosperity breakfast, while about 30 protestors gathered outside the breakfast, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement and Idaho Women in Action, with protestors calling instead for Idaho’s members of Congress to participate in open, public town hall events, the Sun reported.  
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Lehosit said he hopes to have an office set up and running before the end of this year. 
The 2026 legislative session kicks off Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Robert Harshbarger pleaded guilty in 2013 to distributing an unapproved dialysis drug in Kansas. Harshbarger, a pharmacist at the time, bought the cheaper drug from China and sold it as if it were a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $848,504, a $25,000 criminal fine and forfeited $425,000 in cash.
“My husband paid his debt both personally and financially to society,” Diana Harshbarger told Johnson City television station WHJL. “We are thrilled and grateful that the President looked kindly upon Bob’s application.”
Trump’s pardon of Harshbarger came the same day as his pardons of former state House Speaker Glen Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren. 
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s constituent mail services program. Casada and former state Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and worked with prosecutors, steered lawmakers’ business to a company secretly run by Cothren under a fake name. 
In late September, Casada was sentenced to three years in prison, and Cothren to 30 months. Smith has not received a pardon and was sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Trump has been known for using his pardon power to benefit his allies. In October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao’s company helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of a cryptocurrency in the company that Trump’s sons own and operate.
Trump then told CBS News 60 Minutes that he had no idea who Zhao was, and only pardoned him because he was convicted as part of a “Biden witch hunt.”
Diana Harshbarger has received Trump’s endorsement in all three of her congressional elections. The president also endorsed Bobby Harshbarger, the couple’s son, in his 2024 race for a state Senate seat he won. 
Diana Harshbarger is also a pharmacist and was a corporate officer at American Inhalation Medication Specialists, where her husband sold the misbranded drugs.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.
Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.
“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.
Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A United Nations report last week found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.
“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.
“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.
The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, starting on November 10. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.
“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.
Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.
Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.
“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 2.3 F of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 5.4 F by the end of the century.
“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”
There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones —  highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.
Citizen-led pollution monitoring persists in Louisiana, despite law that limits its use

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education and advocacy nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.
Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.
“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

Pete Ricketts hopes record helps him quash midterm populism,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/12/u-s-sen-pete-ricketts-hopes-record-of-results-help-him-quash-midterm-populism/,The biggest force in Nebraska politics focuses on results as he faces Dan Osborn in his first real test as an incumbent.,"Nebraska U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., listens during his event at the Washington County Fairgrounds. Oct. 19, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)ARLINGTON, Neb. — The attendees of an October steak fry at the Washington County Fairgrounds hint at the history and reach of Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ political operation.
The list last month included Gov. Jim Pillen, most of the state’s congressional delegation minus U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin and about 100 GOP supporters. 
Speakers emphasized Ricketts’ impact on the state and why they think his reelection is vital for conservatives in the state, highlighting his time as governor and his help in passing President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“If you like the way this game is played in Nebraska, where we have a majority of Republicans at the table,” U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told the crowd, “We need you there for Pete Ricketts.”
Ricketts is a force in state politics. His endorsements and opposition carry weight, having helped elect a governor and flip legislative seats. He has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics and has a political team behind him that is known for its no-holds-barred approach to campaigning.

“Conservative leadership matters,” Ricketts told the crowd. “Conservative leadership delivers.”
In two terms as governor, Ricketts reshaped the Legislature and state law. He pressed for passage of tax and spending cuts, managed the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on improving the efficiency of state agencies, efforts he has since tried bringing to Washington, D.C., and the federal government. 
Ricketts helped fund a successful ballot measure banning abortions after the first trimester, amending the state constitution in 2024. His family financed efforts to restore the death penalty through a successful 2016 ballot initiative after the Legislature repealed capital punishment and overrode his veto as governor. 
In Congress, Ricketts has wasted no time building relationships and using his financial connections to rise into the role of vice chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He serves on several Senate committees, including the Budget Committee.
And he has sponsored bills that would establish guardrails for stablecoins — essentially a regulatory framework for some cryptocurrencies — and another to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion without parental consent. He also introduced bills to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security and military retirement benefits.

Ricketts first ran for the Senate against U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., in 2006. He lost what was then the most expensive race in state history. In 2023, Gov Jim Pillen appointed Ricketts, whom Ricketts had supported, to replace former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., after Sasse had resigned to lead the University of Florida.
Ricketts last November easily won a special election to finish the final two years of Sasse’s term over Omaha Democrat Preston Love Jr. 
Now, Ricketts is looking to win his first full six-year term but faces a different challenger than in past races — a populist. Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, has challenged Ricketts for his Senate seat, setting up a race that will be watched nationwide.
President Donald Trump’s brand of populism is a driving force in modern politics. Osborn has tried to build a new labor-based populism, one grounded in working-class needs and contrasting with the wealthy.  
Ricketts argues his tilt with Osborn is not a broader ideological fight. He says it’s just another race. 
“We’re just going to run a campaign like we always do … I’ve been in elected service for over 10 years … I’ve got a track record of delivering for Nebraska,” Ricketts told the Examiner at The Door Sports Bar & Grill in Fremont after his Sunday steak fry. He drank a soda, saying he doesn’t drink on Sundays.  
Ricketts has dealt with offshoots of Trump populism for years. The Nebraska Republican Party’s leadership team loyal to him was ousted in 2022 in favor of one more faithful to Trump. Ricketts tussled with Trump in a 2022 proxy war for governor as Ricketts backed Pillen and Trump backed multistate agribusinessman and Trump donor Charles Herbster.
The Ricketts family, who are major donors to conservative causes, have a complicated relationship with Trump. They opposed Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. In 2024, Marlene, his mother, donated to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary. His father, Joe, donated to Trump after the 2024 primary. But Pete Ricketts has said he supports the Trump agenda of lower taxes and less regulation, and his brother raised money for the national GOP.
This year, Ricketts said he’s going to contrast his conservative record of results against what Osborn “says he is and what he actually stands for.”  He and his team have relentlessly tried making the case that Osborn is secretly a Democrat, describing his nonpartisan approach as “fake.” 
Ricketts said “people are smart” and “can see through” Osborn. Osborn is a former Omaha labor leader whose state voter registration records show has been a registered nonpartisan for more than a decade.
Osborn lost to U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer in 2024 by six percentage points. His closer-than-expected race against Fischer has made Osborn a national political name, and a race that Ricketts acknowledged will be “tough.” 
Osborn and his campaign have tried  making the case that Ricketts and the billionaire class now run the country, alluding to the wealth of the senator’s family that created the company that became TD Ameritrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. Ricketts’ financial disclosure forms list him as a millionaire.

Ricketts said one of the top issues in the race will be inflation, adding that former President Joe Biden’s “failed policies” are to blame, but that Trump is working with Senate and House Republicans to lower energy prices. He pointed out that gas prices are lower now than during the Biden presidency. Ricketts also is banking on getting rewarded by voters for the tax cuts in Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
It makes tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less. Ricketts said he could talk about the “fantastic bill” for an hour, “because there’s so much in it that is really good.” 
He pointed to the provisions of the bill, including no tax on overtime and tips and the increase in the child tax credit, as examples of how Republicans who passed the law are helping working families. 
“They’ll see that and the next year, when they start filling out their taxes. They’ll start getting bigger refunds …they’ll see the impact,” Ricketts said. 
State and national Republican strategists have acknowledged the poor polling of Trump’s new tax law but said focusing on specific provisions, such as new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, could help improve public perception of it. 
Osborn recently attacked Ricketts for his long opposition to medical and recreational marijuana. Currently, the state is slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis.
Ricketts said his position on marijuana has “always been very clear.” He made national headlines in 2021 by saying, “If you legalize marijuana, you’re gonna kill your kids. He has argued that approving cannabis for medical use is a step toward legalizing recreational use.  
Trump has been more permissive about cannabis, including saying during the 2024 campaign that he would like to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III, which would loosen federal regulations around it.  
Ricketts voted this week — along with seven Senate Democrats and one independent — to reopen the government after the most extended federal shutdown in U.S. history.  Ricketts said the Democrats played politics and had harmed everyday people. 
Democrats sought to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire by year’s end for individuals who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Ricketts told the Examiner that Democrats are holding the government up for “pandemic-era subsidies,” and Republicans are willing to talk about it after the government reopens. He didn’t answer a direct question of whether he would support or oppose efforts to extend the tax credits.
Ricketts said he would earn the votes of Nebraskans like he has before. 
“I think that’s what this race is going to be about [is] how we’re actually delivering for the American people and how Democrats failed … Osborn is a Democrat, and he wants their failed policies,” Ricketts said. 
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

Roger Wicker to help an indigenous group in his state gain federal recognition as a tribe.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told a reporter from NOTUS that his block on four Mississippi nominees is due to negotiations with Wicker, Mississippi’s senior senator, over federal recognition of the Lumbee and other issues unrelated to the nominees themselves. Wicker serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has enormous sway over the legislation in which the Lumbee tribe would be recognized.
“Roger’s one of my favorite people here, and, you know, it’s just a matter of using the leverage people use every day here,” Tillis said. 
Wicker’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed the effort. 
Tillis has been a vocal supporter of federal recognition for the Lumbee. He is not running for reelection in 2026, so next year will be his final opportunity to secure a bipartisan bill for the indigenous people. 
President Donald Trump has also supported federal recognition for the Lumbee. 
Most of North Carolina’s congressional delegation supports federal recognition of the Lumbee. Language granting them federal recognition was added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending blueprint. 
But language about the Lumbee was not included in the Senate’s version of the blueprint. 
Tillis also said he is negotiating with Wicker over other issues, but he declined to say what the issues were.  
In August, Trump nominated Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. Trump in July nominated Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, his choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.
None of the four nominees responded to requests for comment. Both Wicker and Mississippi’s other U.S. senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, support the nominees, though neither is a member of the Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Kevin Wurm for ProPublica)It’s never been easy to qualify for Social Security disability benefits. Christopher Tincher knows this firsthand.
Tincher began his working life in a coal mine in Aflex, Kentucky, as a teenager in the 1980s. As mines across the region shuttered, he turned to scraping grills at a Hardee’s, then cleaning office buildings at night, then stocking shelves and changing tires at a Walmart in Arkansas. Later, he was hired by a nearby town’s wastewater department. Often, he had to wade into sewage to fix equipment and clean out feces, needles and tampons entering the treatment facility.
In 2017, some of that liquid got into his work boots, which didn’t fit properly and had caused blisters to form. It soaked into his flesh, infecting his right foot all the way to the bone. Doctors cut his leg off below the knee so the infection wouldn’t spread.
Tincher was now a manual laborer on one leg, but he was denied disability benefits by the Social Security Administration the following year. On average, 65% of applicants are rejected, though some successfully appeal.
In Tincher’s case, it was partly because he was 48, and the agency’s rules give priority to disabled workers in their 50s, who are officially deemed to be nearing advanced age and therefore less able to switch careers or develop new skills.
Tincher got a prosthetic leg and went back to work, this time for a medical supplies delivery company. He did this for seven years, frequently in pain, he said. His other leg was almost always in a cast, due to further infected blisters and diabetic nerve damage, and his eyesight was rapidly deteriorating.
This February, he applied for disability again. He was desperate; he was in a wheelchair, and he’d had to move in with his son’s family in Cabot, Arkansas, because he couldn’t pay the rent on his trailer. And there just weren’t other, less physically demanding jobs available locally for someone with his experience: “About the best job I could’ve got would’ve been a door greeter at Walmart, but I don’t think they have those anymore,” he said.
Tincher is now 55, and reaching that age marker helped him qualify, in June, for just over $1,500 a month in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. A three-time Donald Trump voter, he was approved just in the nick of time.
That’s because the Trump administration is rewriting the disability eligibility rules, ostensibly to modernize the program, in ways that will make it even harder for aging blue-collar workers like Tincher to get benefits. Hundreds of thousands just like him would become ineligible for aid.
These changes would fall disproportionately on some of Trump’s most loyal supporters in red states. Most affected would be 50- to 60-year-olds without a high school or college education who have, for decades, toiled in physically grueling jobs, including coal mining, logging, and factory and construction work. The five states where the highest proportions of people rely on these benefits are West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama. Unlike New York, California and a few others, these states do not have their own disability insurance programs for workers to turn to amid federal cuts.

“The Trump administration does not think that simply being 50 years old is a disability,” said a senior administration official who would speak only on condition of anonymity. In the 1970s, when the current rules were written, the official said, many more jobs involved manual labor, but in the internet age that isn’t true anymore. Workers in their 50s with physical injuries are thus receiving disability benefits “when they don’t need to be,” given that they could get a more sedentary job in the modern economy.
The administration has also justified cuts like these on fiscal grounds: The federal budget deficit is massive, the Social Security retirement system could become insolvent in less than a decade and savings need to be found.
But the disability program is paid for, via payroll taxes, by its own trust fund, separate from the one for the retirement program. So reductions in disability payments would not help the retirement system stay afloat. Indeed, cutting eligibility for disability could result in more disabled workers claiming retirement benefits early, actuarial experts note, which would only increase pressure on the retirement system. Meanwhile, the money in the disability fund, which is projected to remain solvent through at least the end of this century, would just sit there, unused.
The Trump administration’s upcoming proposed regulation would make two hugely consequential changes to the Social Security Administration’s disability system, according to four SSA officials with knowledge of the plans. First, it would modernize the job listings that Social Security’s disability adjudicators and judges use to decide if there’s work available in the U.S. economy that a manual laborer could do despite physical impairments — like a low-skilled desk job at a computer or driving for Uber or DoorDash. Second, the new rule would almost entirely remove age as a criterion, in most instances making a 50-plus-year-old like Tincher no more eligible for assistance than a 20-something.
Under the current system, eligibility for benefits ticks up at ages 50, 55 and 60, as workers become more medically vulnerable and less adaptable. Disability adjudicators use a series of grids that consider an applicant’s age, work experience and education level to determine whether they may have the skills to do another, less strenuous job. (The adjudicators make a yes-or-no decision on eligibility; each person who qualifies then receives a set amount based on their lifetime earnings. Once the person starts receiving Social Security retirement benefits, they no longer receive disability payments.)
The regulation that would undo this framework is slated to be formally proposed by December, according to a federal bulletin, although that deadline could push into next year, multiple officials said. The draft, which is based in large part on a plan that the first Trump administration tried to enact in 2020 before running out of time, still needs to be reviewed and edited by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. After that, it will undergo the standard process of allowing the public to submit comments and objections.
But in its current form, the regulation would slash at least 830,000 people’s eligibility for disability benefits, according to an initial estimate from the Urban Institute, an economic policy think tank. As many as 1.5 million could lose eligibility over the next decade, including the widows and children of workers. Disability attorneys and experts familiar with who most relies on the program contend that the numbers could be considerably higher.
Separately, the Trump administration is preparing a proposed regulation that would eliminate or sharply cut the Supplemental Security Income benefits of roughly 400,000 extremely poor and disabled people. This second regulation would reduce support for adults and children with severe disabilities who are living in low-income households, as well as elderly people living with their adult children on tight budgets.
Barton Mackey, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, confirmed in a series of emailed statements that the Trump administration is working on what he called “improvements to the disability adjudication process.” These changes would ensure that the disability system “remains current” and can be more efficiently administered, Mackey said, while also promoting “dignity in work.” (Mackey did not respond to a question about the change to the SSI program.)
Further “speculation on any proposed rule prior to it being published,” he said, “only serves to misguide public discourse and stoke fear in those who rely on disability benefits for economic stability.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai, in response to detailed questions, said that “President Trump will always protect and defend Social Security for American citizens” and pointed to Trump’s recent remarks commemorating the 90th anniversary of Social Security.
Retirement benefits — the largest and most popular of Social Security’s programs — would not be cut under the new regulation. But union leaders and advocates for older Americans said that the likely changes to disability eligibility for aging workers would undermine the financial and retirement security of working-class people and their families. Those who are denied benefits in their 50s would be forced to draw down any savings they have, which could lead them to apply for Social Security’s retirement benefits at age 62 instead of 67. That, in turn, would diminish their and their spouses’ monthly benefit amount by up to 30% until the day they die. Losing eligibility for disability would also block these workers’ access to Medicare, which they’re currently eligible for at their age precisely because they’re disabled.
Disability benefits frequently save recipients from bankruptcy, foreclosure and homelessness, according to research by University of Chicago economists and others.

George Piemonte, a former president of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, has spent 30 years working on disability cases across the South. He emphasized that that’s where these disability cuts would be most acutely felt. “They call it modernizing the program, but that’s political speak,” Piemonte said. “This is a matter of life and death. If these workers don’t get their benefits, some of them are not even going to live to retirement.”
Social Security officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations have long agreed that the disability program needs to be modernized in some practical ways.
For example, disability adjudicators continue to use a Dictionary of Occupational Titles, created in the 1930s and last updated in 1991, to determine whether there are jobs that exist in “significant” numbers in the national economy that an applicant with declining “residual functional capacity” could still do. The DOT, as it is called, is almost comically outdated: It includes “pneumatic tube operator” but not web designer. (Reporting by The Washington Post has helped bring attention to these issues in recent years.)
Under President Barack Obama, the Social Security Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics undertook a yearslong effort to replace the DOT with what would be called the Occupational Requirements Survey, an updated catalog of modern occupations as well as the levels of physical exertion and cognitive difficulty that each job can entail. Field economists surveyed employers across the country, asking how often their employees typically had to climb stairs or lift items of various weights and so on. That detailed dataset now exists, but it isn’t widely used yet; the new regulation would require its implementation.
“So, the technical part of all this has sort of already been accomplished,” said David Weaver, a former top Social Security Administration official who helped to develop the survey, known as the ORS, during the Obama years. (Weaver is now a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina.)
“But,” he added, “conservative economist types want to also make it harder for certain workers to get disability benefits, which would be a policy choice.” The complexity of the potential changes — the draft of the Trump regulation is hundreds of pages long and has been called the “mega reg” by insiders — has helped to mask this, Weaver and others said.
The new rule would almost entirely remove age as a criterion, in most instances making a 50-plus-year-old like Tincher no more eligible for assistance than a 20-something. (Kevin Wurm for ProPublica)
“Simplifying and Modernizing the Disability Adjudication Process” is how Mark Warshawsky headlined his written remarks when he testified in 2023 before a congressional subcommittee examining the issue. Warshawsky, an architect of the disability overhaul during the first Trump administration as the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy at the Social Security Administration, testified that the current system wrongly “presumes a workforce with low levels of education which is largely involved in physical labor, works long hours, has little flexibility in work schedules, low adaptability, little access to assistive technology, never works from home, and retires early fairly often.” He also said that increasing eligibility starting at age 50 is not very scientific; for starters, it’s unfair to 49-year-olds. (Warshawsky, who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, declined an interview request from ProPublica.)
Warshawsky was unable to get the disability regulation across the finish line before Trump lost the 2020 election. But Russell Vought, the powerful head of Trump’s Office of Management and Budget and one of the originators of Project 2025, picked up on this first-term agenda item and has pursued it again this year.
The disability restructuring was “Russ Vought’s No. 1 priority for the Social Security Administration from Day 1,” said Leland Dudek, who was acting commissioner of the agency from February to May. In February, Dudek said, his staff met with Vought’s staff on multiple occasions; together, they “dug up what was done four years ago,” he said, indicating that the new proposed rule will be similar to a 2020 draft that was leaked to the press. (The senior Trump administration official said that Dudek is “disgruntled” and that the disability changes are no more of a priority for Vought than the rest of the administration’s “deregulatory agenda.” In the past, Vought has publicly pressed for fewer veterans and others to receive disability benefits.)
To opponents of the forthcoming regulation, including many still inside the Social Security Administration, Warshawsky and Vought’s conception of the modern economy neglects the fact that workers like Tincher grew up in a different world. They started their working lives at a time when most people didn’t have personal computers, when it wasn’t as common to get a high school education and when physical labor offered a path to eventual retirement security. To switch the rules now pulls the rug out from under them just as they’re reaching their most vulnerable years, officials and experts said.
“I believe disconnects occur when more highly educated policy people do not fully understand or appreciate what workers in physically demanding, labor-intensive occupations, such as longshoremen, have gone through,” said Steve Rollins, who was deputy associate commissioner of the Social Security Administration’s Office of Disability Policy during the latter years of the first Trump administration and associate commissioner through the Biden administration. Rollins oversaw the agency’s work on modernizing the disability program from 2019 to 2024.
What’s more, vocational experts said in interviews, even if 50- or 60-year-old former coal miners or factory workers are denied the disability benefits they say they need, they’re still likely to retire early, a finding backed by recent research. After all, if they try to get a desk job — assuming one is available in their rural or exurban community — they may feel they don’t have the education or training for it, and they may also be subject to age discrimination in the hiring process. As Michelle Aliff, a certified rehabilitation counselor who testifies at Social Security disability hearings nationwide as an impartial vocational expert, put it: “An oil field roustabout in his 50s isn’t going to just sit down at a computer for work without additional training.”
The Trump administration’s plan to transform the U.S. disability system, once finalized, would interact with other cuts to the social safety net that the president and Republicans in Congress have already authored. For example, under legislation dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and signed into law by Trump, work requirements will be added to Medicaid; people with disabilities will largely be exempt, but the best way to establish eligibility for that exemption is to qualify for Social Security’s disability program, which would become harder under the new rule. A disabled worker could instead turn to Obamacare’s individual exchanges for insurance coverage, but Republicans are allowing the tax credit that makes those premiums affordable to expire.
Tincher feels lucky he applied when he did. Being approved for disability has meant his copays are covered, he can finally afford groceries and he has time to help watch over his grandkids. Still, he also feels a tinge of guilt. “I wish every day I could still work,” he said. His dad, a coal miner, once told him to work until the day he died. “Having to ask for help is hard especially for men to do, men of my generation.”
All Tincher would say to the officials pushing the changes to the disability program, he said, is “you don’t know until you’re here, at this point in a working life.”

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Voters just approved the Vibrant Bond package, authorizing nearly $1 billion for construction across Denver. It’s the role of the Denver Auditor’s Office to provide oversight of that construction: Fair contracting and prevailing wage enforcement keeps projects on track, protects workers, and levels the field for responsible firms. Labor compliance is a core project risk that the Denver Auditor should track in real time.
Large bond packages attract bidders, including some who cut corners. Misclassification and wage theft distort bids, punish rule-followers, and often lead to delays and overruns. The answer is to embed labor oversight in construction delivery rather than chase violations after the fact.
Start with certified payroll in a usable format. Require machine-readable certified payroll every pay period for all bond-funded work, including for subcontractors. The Denver Auditor’s office can publish project and contractor-level compliance summaries while protecting personal data, and sample classifications, hours, and rates against wage determinations and project records. These are capabilities this division has already shown they can do effectively, so they should seek to standardize that work in this bond.

Do unannounced field checks, too. Short site visits can be used to confirm worker classification, overtime, apprenticeship utilization, and safety. Log findings promptly and route corrective action through the contract. This protects the interests of workers and taxpayers. Short site visits deter violations with minimum disruption.
The City of Denver should also tie payments to compliance. Make retainage release contingent on documented wage compliance through closeout for primes and subs. If findings or unpaid damages remain, retainage is held. This aligns incentives with following the rule of law on wage and labor topics.
It is also critical that the city protects the voices of workers on these publicly-funded projects. Maintain a multilingual reporting channel with anonymous tips and post anti-retaliation rules and wage rates at every site entrance. When workers know their rights and have an avenue to report, issues surface early and projects are more successful.
The city should also consider community workforce benefits for large bond projects. Set measurable goals for apprenticeships in partnership with labor unions, support local hiring, and incentivize participation for small or disadvantaged businesses in our community.
Finally, build in more proactive construction auditing practices. As vendors are onboarded, require a short compliance briefing prior to work beginning. Cover information about wage determinations, record-keeping, and audit standards. Start clean by setting clear expectations. Prevent findings instead of just reporting them later after the damage has already been done.
This approach is fair to everyone. Workers get the pay the law requires. Responsible contractors compete on execution, not shortcuts. Taxpayers get projects that finish without avoidable time delays or cost overruns.
This bond package will shape the future of our parks, streets, and public facilities. If managed well, it will also build trust. The Denver Auditor has an opportunity to show what strong construction oversight can do to support workers and contribute to success. Let’s hold this Vibrant Bond and ourselves to the high standards that the people of Denver deserve from their leaders.

Dozens of community members asked the Detroit school district on Tuesday night to update its sanctuary policy and train all staff on how to interact with immigration enforcement.
Speakers at the board meeting also asked the Detroit Public Schools Community District to protect students outside of school buildings and provide more transportation options for families with immigration concerns. Community members asked for in-school counseling for students at risk for immigration enforcement, referrals to legal services, and more resources for language acquisition classrooms.
Kristen Schoettle, an English language teacher at Western International High School, told the board DPSCD’s 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy needs to be updated.
“As we all know, a lot has changed since 2019,” she said. “We have to do more than simply say ICE isn’t allowed in school buildings.”
The concerns were raised as federal immigration agencies have ramped up enforcement, including arrests of parents and teens outside school buildings. Last week, a child care worker was dragged by federal agents from the Chicago center where she worked.
Though dozens showed up to address the districts’ policies around immigration concerns, the board asked for three representatives from the group to each speak for up to six minutes.
Some speakers ignored the board’s request and made additional comments in support of protecting immigrant students and families. The board did not stop them from speaking.
Chair Corletta Vaughn offered pamphlets on immigration resources to those at the meeting.
“You are not alone and we are 100% in support of all of our students and families,” said Vaughn.
The district’s sanctuary policy requires the superintendent’s office and general counsel to sign off before staff allow immigration agents with warrants to enter school property or access student data.
In January, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district would begin training principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors, attendance agents, and security guards on the protocols. Community members want all staff to be included.
“We want to know who has been officially trained,” said Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas. “Do our secretaries and security guards know what to do if ICE is right outside or trying to get in?”
West said she and many other staff members feel unprepared and want training.
“This is the very least we should be doing to be proactive and make sure everyone is protected,” she said.
Schoettle said other public school districts, including in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, have mandatory training for all staff, regular “Know Your Rights” presentations and in-school counseling.
Schoettle told Chalkbeat that better communication with bilingual families is needed in the district. A robo call sent out by the district last month intended to quell rumors about immigration actions in the community caused “chaos,” she said.
Schoettle said the call only went out in English and it was misinterpreted by families, creating confusion and fear. The next day, about 15% of her class was absent, she said.
Frank Espinosa, another teacher at Western International, asked the board to provide better transportation for undocumented students and families with mixed immigration status.
As the district explores ways to use additional state funding to get kids to school, Schoettle said DPSCD should invest in more ride shares for families with immigration fears.
“There are undocumented parents who risk their safety every day to take their kids to school,” she said.
Vitti responded to the speakers’ concerns Tuesday night, saying any changes to the sanctuary policy would have to be made by the board, adding he would assist them administratively.
No members of the board responded to the speakers’ concerns after the public comment.
The school system has enrolled more newcomers and English learners in recent years. Last school year, there were more than 7,400 English learners, which represented 15% of the district’s students.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration ended a policy that deemed schools and day cares “sensitive locations” protected from immigration enforcement.
The administration’s immigration enforcement policies and increased arrests have impacted Detroit families, prompting fear in neighborhoods and schools for months.
In June, hundreds gathered at a board meeting to ask school leaders to decry the immigration arrest of DPSCD student Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an undocumented teen from Colombia. After hours of public comment, the board reversed course and made a statement asking for Maykol’s release.
Days later, he was deported.
At October’s DPSCD board meeting, Vitti responded to several people who asked the district to provide “Know Your Rights” immigration enforcement training for students.
“I’ve certainly heard today the need for training and information sessions for our families that are fearful of ICE,” he said during the meeting. “I’ll work with the team and legal counsel to determine what exactly we can and can’t do, but obviously, as a district, we want to do everything we can in support of our students and our families.”
Vitti added that the district has never been contacted by ICE or given information to the agency.

Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? (Getty Images)I entered Genesis Recovery Center in Grayson because of my alcoholism by choice, not by court order.
The building looked worn, a physical manifestation of the lives inside, stitched together, imperfect, but still standing. In a culture where things are increasingly disposable, it’s reassuring to find a place that values repairing over discarding — a kind of micro-service economy where both the building and the people are mended rather than thrown away.
Genesis is part of Recovery Kentucky, a statewide network of 16 long-term, peer-run recovery centers created through a partnership among the Kentucky Housing Corp., the Department of Corrections and local nonprofits. The program began in 2005 to reduce homelessness and addiction-related incarceration by offering free community-based recovery housing. Participants stay six to 12 months, work, attend meetings and mentor newcomers. Funding comes from state and federal grants rather than private insurance, so care doesn’t end when coverage does.
What makes Recovery Kentucky distinct is that it’s peer-run. People who’ve already completed the program help operate it — supervising chores, leading groups and mentoring newcomers. Staff members aren’t outsiders with clipboards; they’re graduates who’ve stayed to give back. That structure builds accountability no policy memo can. When someone stumbles, it’s often another resident, not a professional, who helps them stand up again. It also builds leadership — many graduates go on to work in treatment, social services or re-entry programs, carrying that ethic of peer support into other corners of the state.
The public model looks different from the insurance-driven programs many Kentuckians know. In those settings, a person’s length of stay often depends on the reimbursement schedule, not readiness. Recovery Kentucky trades paperwork for accountability. Residents cook, clean and answer to one another. It isn’t glamorous, and neither is addiction, but the approach builds something sturdier than abstinence: belonging.
The difference matters as Kentucky debates how to sustain and expand treatment access. Private networks such as Addiction Recovery Care (ARC) have grown quickly through Medicaid billing, and some now face federal scrutiny over documentation and profit motives. ARC, now being acquired by the Florida-based company Ethema Health Corp., shows how out-of-state investors are moving into Kentucky’s recovery industry. Recovery Kentucky moves more slowly and on a smaller budget, yet its results show up in jails, shelters and workplaces. A graduate who stays sober, gains employment, and mentors others is one less person cycling through emergency rooms or court dockets.
The real question is how we see people in recovery. Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? One model extracts value through billing codes; the other creates value through belonging and contribution. The return on investment isn’t measured in profit margins but in families kept whole, jobs filled, and neighborhoods made steadier.
We already treat bridges and highways as investments that connect towns. Recovery Kentucky shows that people can serve the same purpose. When someone rebuilds a life, they also rebuild the capacity of their community — the workforce, the tax base, the shared belief that improvement is possible. The infrastructure metaphor isn’t just symbolic; it’s economic. Every graduate who stays sober and working keeps public dollars from being spent on jail beds, foster care and emergency rooms.
This isn’t an argument for one model over every other. Kentucky needs multiple paths to recovery. But the public, peer-run system offers lessons policymakers shouldn’t overlook: consistency, community ownership and low cost per participant. The programs rely on modest state support, and that funding is a fraction of what relapse and incarceration cost taxpayers.
When politicians talk about rebuilding Appalachia, they usually mean roads and broadband. Those things matter, but none of them last if the people who live here can’t participate. Recovery is infrastructure. It rebuilds a workforce, a family, a sense of purpose. And like the old building in Grayson, what’s been repaired by hand often lasts the longest.
If Kentucky invested in recovery infrastructure the way it invests in highways, how many lives and towns could we reconnect?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2164284264-1024x833.jpg,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk International Airport)Richmond resident Brianna Curry didn’t expect her trip home from a veterinary conference in Hawaii to include shivering at Chicago O’Hare International Airport in a sundress. Her connecting flight to Norfolk was canceled Monday morning — one of thousands scrubbed nationwide as the federal government shutdown rippled through the aviation system.
“They rescheduled for the next day,” Curry said. “It’s 20 degrees in Chicago and I only had Hawaii clothes.”
After pleading with exhausted airline staff, she snagged the last seat on a later flight — just as her co-worker, initially stranded on standby, was called aboard moments before takeoff. The pair landed in Norfolk hours behind schedule but grateful to be among the lucky few who made it home.
As the shutdown stretches through its sixth week, air travel across the country — and in Virginia — has begun to buckle under mounting pressure. 
Over 11,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees have been furloughed nationwide, while more than 13,200 air traffic controllers are reporting to work without pay, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Even before the shutdown, Virginia was navigating a shortage of controllers at nine airports statewide. 
The FAA has ordered a gradual nationwide flight reduction to maintain safety standards amid worsening staffing shortages. 
A 4% cut took effect Friday, ramping up to 6% Monday and projected to reach 10% by week’s end at 40 major airports, including Washington Dulles International and Ronald Reagan Washington National.
Controller shortages led to average delays of four hours at Chicago O’Hare and 45 minutes in Las Vegas on Monday. The FAA warned that similar disruptions could spread to cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.
 Virginia’s airports holding on — for now

Virginia, home to about 1,110 air traffic controllers — among the highest concentrations in the nation — has so far avoided major slowdowns. 
Officials at Richmond International Airport said Monday that while a few flights were delayed or canceled, the disruptions were largely “related to mandatory flight reductions” at other airports.
“At this time, RIC has not been directly affected by the federal government shutdown or by any associated flight reductions,” the airport said in a statement. Federal workers with the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection remain on duty, officials said.
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority — which oversees Dulles and Reagan National — said its locally managed operations such as parking, concessions and public safety remain unaffected. But it warned that “the staffing of essential federal services such as security screening and air traffic control is unfunded and could affect flight schedules or security checkpoint wait times.”
Both agencies urged passengers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport and to arrive early — two hours before domestic flights and three hours for international departures.
 Safety first, officials say

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in a statement that the agency’s flight reductions are meant to “maintain the highest standards of safety” in the national airspace system.
“My department has many responsibilities, but our number one job is safety,” Duffy said. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system as controllers continue to work without pay.”
Bedford said the agency is monitoring operations closely and “will not hesitate to take further action to make sure air travel remains safe.”
The FAA has also restricted visual flight rule approaches, parachute operations and photo missions near facilities with critical staffing shortages. Commercial space launches and reentries are now confined to overnight hours.
 Controllers working without pay

For Virginia’s more than 1,100 controllers, the shutdown has meant continuing one of the most stressful jobs in government — without a paycheck. Many have taken on second jobs or dipped into savings to cover bills, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
“This is the erosion of the safety margin the public never sees, but the American public relies upon every day,” Nick Daniels, the union’s president, said in a news conference Monday.
Daniels previously said controllers are “working ten-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay,” warning that the situation “creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work.”
“For this nation’s air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship,” Daniels said. “Asking them to go without a full month’s pay or more is simply not sustainable.”
He called on Congress to “pass a clean continuing resolution to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation.”
On Monday evening, the U.S. Senate narrowly approved an agreement on a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government and end the shutdown, after seven Democrats — including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — and one independent joined Republicans to advance the measure. 
The deal, which keeps agencies funded through early January, now heads to the House, where swift passage is expected after weeks of mounting pressure from federal workers and the aviation sector.
Virginia already entered the shutdown crisis with a staffing shortfall in its air‐traffic control workforce.
According to the FAA’s 11-year workforce plan, the commonwealth was missing 133 certified professional controllers across nine facilities as of early 2025 — including 15 at the Norfolk Tower and 33 at the Potomac TRACON.
 TSA stretches thin

At the nation’s airports, Transportation Security Administration officers — among 64,000 federal employees nationwide — are also working without pay. A TSA spokesperson cautioned in October that “an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.”
“TSA will continue operations to keep the traveling public safe,” the spokesperson said. “We kindly ask for our passengers’ patience during this time.”
The TSA’s lost and found office at Reagan National has closed due to staffing limits, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said, urging passengers to “be extra mindful of your belongings in the security screening area.”
 Federal workers feel the squeeze

The shutdown’s toll extends far beyond airport terminals. The federal government employs about 147,000 Virginians — from defense analysts in Northern Virginia to meteorologists in Blacksburg — making the state among the hardest hit economically.
For federal aviation workers, the strain is both financial and emotional. Many controllers and TSA employees say morale has plummeted as they balance safety-critical responsibilities with the uncertainty of missed paychecks.
TSA and other federal workers saw their first zero paycheck Oct. 24. As Tuesday marked their second pay cycle without pay, some have turned to food banks and credit unions offering emergency loans.
But for now, Virginia’s airports remain mostly operational — a testament to the thousands of unpaid workers who keep planes moving and passengers safe. However, officials warn that the system’s resilience has limits.
“We are the rope in this tug of war game that we shouldn’t be the rope,” said NATCA President Daniels. “This has nothing to do with us… The real story is that America’s air traffic control system is falling further behind because of this shutdown.”

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)Continuity gaps within Virginia’s artificial intelligence registry are raising concerns about transparency, oversight and the implementation of standards across state government, state researchers said Monday. 
JLARC provided lawmakers an update on the registry as part of an ongoing review of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA), which services 65 executive branch agencies, security, project management, procurement and information technology planning for the commonwealth. The registry’s purpose is to track and approve state projects that would use AI technology.  
Researchers said that as of Oct. 31, VITA approved 90 out of about 182 cases that were submitted by state agencies frustrated with the agency’s process guidance and the registry using multiple systems that are “not well coordinated.” VITA said the total approved registry AI cases increased to 112 at Monday’s meeting.
“One theme that emerged through all of these conversations is that VITA does not have one singular voice around AI for agencies,” said Kimberly Sarte, associate director for ongoing oversight and fiscal analysis for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). “We heard the different teams within VITA may have different answers to the same question depending on when they were asked.” 
Sarte added that VITA is working to establish a “centralized AI information role, which will also bring them in line with our peer states.”

VITA was required to establish IT security standards under an executive order signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Jan. 18, 2024.
From the order, VITA created Virginia’s AI registry for agencies to submit potential AI use cases, or projects, for review and approval by VITA. Cases are approved based on whether there is a “positive outcome for citizens,” according to the state standards published by VITA.
The state standards also require agencies to examine alternative technologies and processes before choosing AI, to develop a regulatory impact analysis, and to clearly state whether AI will make recommendations or decisions on behalf of users. 
Sarte said the AI tools Smartling and CoPilot Chat have been made available to all executive branches.
Some of the approved 90 cases include the Virginia Racing Commission using meeting transcription for hearings, the Department of Corrections improving facility monitoring and security and VITA developing a chatbot to help users navigate its website.
However, the problem researchers identified is that case status is not updated regularly, and some agencies are unclear about which types of use cases to include and are not reporting them.
Researchers are also unclear whether the cases not entered into the registry comply with state standards.
Sarte said VITA is working to address some of the frustrations including developing an AI resource team to reduce inconsistent guidance.
Bob Osman, chief information officer for VITA, did not directly address the frustrations expressed by agencies. However, he did say the registry is a key part of the agency’s approach to AI oversight.
On Monday, Osman presented a chart that indicated that the use of AI is accelerating. AI is currently being used to help the Department of Transportation determine when roads need to be paved, to aid the Department of Quality review and approve water permits faster and help VITA create programs faster with fewer mistakes, improving government technology tools more efficiently.
“If you look at the results, we’ve come a long way in terms of where we got started, and in terms of the number of use cases (that) are approved in Virginia,” Osman said, “and we’re finding more and more use cases as agencies look at opportunities and try to learn about ways of taking advantage and harnessing this really powerful technology.”
He added that “every job is going to involve some kind of AI. There’s just no way around it.”
Relatedly, Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, who represents Virginia, and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri introduced bipartisan legislation called the AI-Related Jobs Clarity Act. The bill aims to track jobs lost to AI as part of a broader effort to increase transparency about AI use in government. 
Under the proposed legislation, major companies and federal agencies would be required to report AI-related layoffs to the U.S. Department of Labor, which would compile them into a publicly available report.
“Good policy starts with good data,”  Warner said in a Nov. 5 statement. “This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce – what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging. 
The goal is to “make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind,” Warner said.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Maine lawmakers will meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss a proposal that would restore someone’s right to possess a firearm after being convicted of a nonviolent felony. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee has a work session scheduled for 1:30 p.m. to discuss LD 1009, the proposal from Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft) that would provide an avenue to restore certain rights for a person convicted of a nonviolent felony after they have repaid their debt to society. The legislation, which was carried over from the first session, stipulates that those rights can’t be restored until 10 years after any imposed sentence is completed. 
The committee held a public hearing for the bill on May 1, during which the Department of Public Safety came out against the measure due to limited resources that would make it difficult to take on the additional workload it would require. While the judicial branch testified neither for nor against the proposal, a representative pointed out that there is not a current digital mechanism for the department to communicate this sort of information with the courts nor does the bill leave room for any judicial review. 
During the public hearing, Perkins was asked if he would support an alternative approach, such as reclassifying those nonviolent crimes. However, he declined saying there needs to be some price to bring justice for victims but said he is open to amending the process for one’s rights to be restored, so long as it maintains the intent of the bill. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no amendments listed on the committee’s website.
The committee held two work sessions back in May, but didn’t take action on the proposal and carried it over to the next session, which technically starts in January. 
The bill isn’t the only gun reform that the committee is slated to revisit. It also opted to wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases because of an ongoing lawsuit over the law. 
A bill that would require the Department of Public Safety to adopt rules specifying minimum security requirements for gun shops, LD 1821, was also carried over from last session.

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/ Virginia Mercury)A provision significantly limiting the sale of intoxicating hemp products made its way into legislation to reopen the federal government just a day before the Senate approved the bill. Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.
While states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high — without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.
That’s led dozens of states to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill — which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today — goes too far.
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.
Texas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.
This summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.
Last month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.
Missouri hemp businesses fear new federal THC limits will destroy the industry

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the attorneys general wrote.
Hemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.
“Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,” he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.
Though it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.
On Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry.
“The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,” the trade group posted online.
Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.
“These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we’ve been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,” he told Stateline.
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.
But fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would “eradicate the hemp industry” and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.
The hemp loophole
Hemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.
But that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
That’s because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

“With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,” she said. “But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You’re not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.”
Harris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.
But even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.
“There’s a big part of that activity that you can’t control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that’s one thing that they’re asking for is federal leadership on this issue,” she said. “I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.”
If approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.
For example, the change likely won’t dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.
But in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.
On Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.
“The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,” he said.
‘Running with knives’
The hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.










Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.


– Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association


But producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.
“They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that’s somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],” he said.
His organization cheered the Senate’s efforts “to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.”
Lindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.
“To me, that’s like running with knives,” he told Stateline.
Floridians react to federal legislation that could ‘devastate’ state’s hemp industry

The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.
In its “Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,” the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.
Those results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.
“In my mind, if it’s marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,” Mullins said.
He said calling the unregulated products “hemp” is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: “Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.”
Mullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws — including those against trafficking marijuana without a license — that could help address the issue.
Catherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)New Ohio legislation that would require doctors to read a legal statement before medication abortions telling patients they can sue them could create a new barrier to constitutionally protected abortion care, experts say.
The Republican-led Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require health care providers who prescribe drugs to induce an abortion to also provide a statement and written information to patients about their ability to sue their health care providers, before the drugs can be prescribed.
The statement included in the language of the bill would read that “the state of Ohio wants you to be aware that you and your family may hold the manufacturer, distributor, your health care provider and the health care facilities financially accountable” if the patients dies, is injured, or suffers complications.
Providers, facilities, and manufacturers would also be held liable for “debilitating side effects” such as rupture of unknown ectopic pregnancy or infection “if the provider doesn’t address the side effect,” or “if the medication fails to terminate the pregnancy which results in a failed abortion or requires surgical intervention.”
Doctors, researchers, and advocates alike say the bill could bring a chilling effect to the relationship between doctors and their patients.
“I think it could be really damaging to the physician-patient relationship,” said Dr. Tracy Griffith, and OB/GYN at University Hospitals and a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “It feels like it’s designed to produce mistrust.”
Griffith said she and other doctors are already trained to provide the risks of any medication they prescribe, and to have conversations about what’s best for the individual patient with whom they’re working.
The training extends to treatment of any complications that might arise, and always has, according to Griffith.
The new measure in the Ohio legislature wouldn’t address any supposed issues with the medication itself that anti-abortion groups and anti-abortion lawmakers bring up.
“This bill isn’t going to improve the safety of this medication, it’s not going to improve the medical advice I give them,” Griffith said.
“It’s going to scare providers away from providing the medicine or scare patients away from this option.”
Conducting a medication abortion before providing the statement of legal liability could result in lawsuits from the patients, the maternal grandparents if the patient was a minor or died during the procedure, and the “father of the unborn child, if the father is married to the woman” at the time of the medication abortion, according to the bill.
The pregnant person’s next of kin could also sue the providers, facilities, and drug manufacturers if the person dies “due to the abortion or a complication related to the abortion.”
Those suing due to the medication abortion could ask for three times the cost of the medication, along with “damages for injuries and loss.”
The fact that the legal liability is singularly targeted at medication abortion is a giant red flag for Griffith, in a state that has constitutional protections for abortion care but also has a Republican-majority legislature who has produced several bills to try to further regulate reproductive health care.
“There is no other field of medicine where we’re talking about potential criminalization of care,” Griffith said.
Anti-abortion lobby group Ohio Right to Life released a statement saying they approve of the bill.
“Women who are facing a difficult choice should be given all the information they need to make such a critical decision,” said Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder, in a statement.
“It is our hope that more women will see the dangers of abortion pills and make the decision to choose life, for their baby and themselves.”
The medication abortion option has been proven to be a safe one, with studies showing very rare rates of serious medical problems, even when administered through telehealth.
The rates are comparable or safer than over-the-counter pain relievers.
A 2024 study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that, of more than 6,000 medication abortions obtained through telehealth studied in the research, 97.7% “were complete without subsequent known intervention or ongoing pregnancy after the initial treatment.”
The study also found that 99.8% of the medication abortions did not include “serious adverse events.”
A 2015 study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology studied women in the California Medicaid program who had an abortion, and found less than 1% of patients sought emergency room care for an abortion-related complication after the procedure.
For medication abortion specifically, the study found a “major complication rate” of 0.16%.
In comparison, about 1% to 2% of users of pain relievers like Advil and Aleve “experienced a serious (gastrointestinal) complication during treatment,” according to a 2013 study.
Epidemiology professor Alison Norris has already spent time in the Statehouse providing data for lawmakers on bills that could directly and indirectly impact reproductive health care and abortion medication.
She is ready to do it again for the newest measure.
“Holding medical providers who offer abortion care to a different standard is illogical,” Norris told the Capital Journal.
The professor is also the co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network (OPEN), a group of professors and academic researchers throughout Ohio and other states specifically focused on researching abortion and contraception policy impacts.
“We know that when there are a large number of regulations, it creates an environment in which it’s hard, sometimes impossible, to provide the standard of care that we want to,” Norris said.
With a standard of care that already includes providing patients with the risks and benefits of treatment and the likelihood of complications, Norris said “creating a complicated legal milieu makes it harder for providers to provider their care in the very best way.”
Because the safety of medication abortion has been so scientifically proven, Norris said, it would be better if more and more providers were able to offer the care, rather than regulating the treatment in a way that discourages use.
“The evidence is that it’s common, it’s safe, it’s very acceptable for people,” Norris said. “There’s all kinds of people for whom that is the best care, and we should be reducing the barriers to excellent care.”
Clinics like Planned Parenthood in Ohio are, at this point, used to legislation that attempts to regulate around the constitutional amendment 57% of Ohioans approved in 2023, and they see this as yet another “political attack.”
“This is another example of lawmakers not listening to the constituents’ will,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
“It demonstrates that these are not lawmakers who are invested in serving their communities … but their own interests.”
The new legislation has been referred to the Ohio Senate Health Committee, but has not yet had a hearing scheduled.

Photos courtesy of candidatesA Democratic challenger focused on health care and housing and a local Republican business owner have officially qualified to compete in a special election to fill a vacant House seat in northeast Georgia.
Republican Mack “Dutch” Guest IV and Democrat Eric Gisler are on the ballot for the House District 121 special election on Tuesday, Dec. 9. Early voting starts Monday, Nov. 17.
The December special election was called after the abrupt resignation of Republican State Rep. Marcus Wiedower from Watkinsville, who stepped down to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, is considered conservative-leaning, with Wiedower winning his last election with 61% of the vote.
Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner who challenged Wiedower in 2024, said he feels he has a chance to flip the seat in the special election after Georgia and national Democrats outperformed in the November elections and flipped two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission in a landslide, winning statewide constitutional offices in Georgia for the first time since 2006.
“Reaching out to the same people, Democratic voters who voted last week, and thanking them for that, and asking them to turn out one more time to vote for me, and I think that gives us a real shot at winning this election,” Gisler said.

Gisler’s platform centers on increasing access to health care, addressing housing affordability and strengthening voting rights.
He said in an interview Tuesday that federal cuts to programs like health insurance and education are being ignored by state leaders.
“We need to look at innovative ways that the state of Georgia can step up and increase access to health, whether that’s financially or even just geographically,” Gisler said, pointing to the impending expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies that is likely to significantly increase the number of uninsured Georgians.
And Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey echoed the sentiment in a statement.
“Democrats won this month’s PSC races not just in traditionally blue counties, but in swing counties and even deep-red counties that voted upwards of 60% for Trump last year. It’s proof positive that when Democrats invest, organize, and compete everywhere, we can’t be counted out anywhere,” Bailey said.
Democrats overperformed in every county in the state in this month’s off-year special elections except two: Webster and Miller counties. Those results were also influenced by municipal elections that favored Democrats.
Democrats rush to seize momentum after Georgia victories built on affordability messaging

Carmen Bergman, director of the House Republican Caucus, downplayed Democrats’ confidence in a statement, saying that Republicans have a “year-round political operation” and aren’t “relying on any real or imagined waves to guide electoral outcomes.”
“If Democrats think they can ride momentum into House District 121, they’re going to find the tide’s gone out,” Bergman said.
Republicans control 100 seats in the 180-seat chamber.
In a press release announcing his candidacy, Guest framed his campaign around local concerns. His core priorities are improving transportation, strengthening education and keeping communities safe. Guest helps run LAD Truck Lines, a Watkinsville-based transportation business, has served as president of the Oconee County Rotary Club and entered the race with endorsements from Oconee County Commissioner Mark Thomas and Sheriff James Hale.
“I want to focus on the issues that matter most to the people who call this district home,” Guest said in a statement. “In Atlanta, every decision I make will be for our families, for our businesses, and for our values.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is the second in a three-part series on New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. You can read Part I here, and Part III will be published on Friday.

THEY CALL IT the disability cliff.
When young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities finish high school, they lose access to the extensive services provided by public school special education programs. Most parents work, and while that allows them to help support their adult children financially, their absence creates a care void that is not easy to fill.
Over many months, the Bulletin has explored abuse and neglect in New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system through court filings, law enforcement documents, state records, and conversations with lawyers, advocates, and family members. Breakdowns in care in recent years have led to many instances of preventable harm — sometimes fatal harm — and left in their wake devastated families who wanted only to give their children opportunities for a good life but found tragedy instead.
Those tragedies often begin at the precarious edge of the disability cliff — and that was the case for the Weidlich family.
‘Looking for a body’
When Stephen “Stevie” Weidlich Jr. aged out of high school in 2017 at Crotched Mountain School for Students with Disabilities in Greenfield, his father, Stephen Weidlich Sr., saw few options.
Weidlich worked full time and Stevie’s mother wasn’t involved in his life. He considered trying to get designated by the state as an in-home care provider of state services, which would have allowed him to receive some Medicaid funding as Stevie’s caregiver. Such arrangements typically cost the government a fraction of what placement in a residential facility costs.

However, the family felt discouraged about pursuing that path when an employee of PathWays of the River Valley, one of 10 agencies designated by the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services to coordinate care for people with disabilities, stopped responding to their inquiries on the matter, Weidlich said in a recent interview. 
The one option that remained was to place Stevie in a home run by PathWays with a live-in caregiver, a service people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are legally entitled to receive through Medicaid and other state and federal dollars. 
Within a few years, Stevie would become a casualty of that system. In December 2022, police knocked on the Weidlich family’s door in Unity to tell them Stevie’s body had been found in the woods behind the home of his caregiver.
At the time of his death, Stevie, 26, was living in Allenstown with PathWays employee Douglas Onkundi.

The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

As a live-in caregiver, it was Onkundi’s responsibility to ensure Stevie, who had physical, developmental, and intellectual disabilities, was given 24/7 care. However, according to documents from a state investigation obtained and being made public for the first time by the Bulletin, Onkundi wasn’t actually living in the home at the time of Stevie’s death. He told police he was living in Manchester, and would return to Allenstown to give Stevie his medications. In his stead, investigators learned, Onkundi was paying another man to live in the home and care for Stevie with part of his PathWays paycheck and pocketing the rest. The man had no formal training and was not officially authorized by Pathways or Stevie’s family. Neither Onkundi nor the other man were criminally charged.
In conversations with state investigators, PathWays managers said they’d told Onkundi on multiple occasions only trained staff can work with the people in their care. However, according to the report, Onkundi said there was “an unwritten rule that everything was OK unless PathWays said otherwise.”
On Dec. 18, 2022, security camera footage from a neighbor shows Onkundi leaving the home in the morning and returning around 8 p.m. the day Stevie died, per the report. 
Investigators were told Stevie had locked himself in the bedroom and that when Onkundi returned, he used a ladder to climb up to the window and discovered the glass was broken and Stevie was gone. Onkundi told state investigators he searched for Stevie, who had a history of fleeing, before calling police.

It was too late. A police dog found Stevie’s body in the woods behind the home. There was evidence of hypothermia and a blunt force injury to Stevie’s ribs consistent with either a fall or a blow to the chest, the police report said. It was a cold night with snow on the ground.
Weidlich said Onkundi called him after the death and what he said infuriated him even more. 
“Stevie was not mobile,” he said. “He was in a wheelchair. He can only crawl. (Onkundi) told me when he noticed Stevie was gone, he got in his car and drove around looking for Stevie. How does that make any f—ing sense?”
Onkundi told him they were looking for “the body.”
“You were looking for a body or you were looking for Stevie?” he said. “Obviously, if you were looking for a body, what does that say? You weren’t looking for a live person.”
‘Daddy, I can’t see’
Stevie was born in Long Island, New York, in 1996 and spent his early childhood there. Weidlich said Stevie had “an awesome sense of humor,” and the whole family remembers him as fun-loving and a jokester. He was 9 years old when his disabilities began to emerge.
“One day, I’m getting ready to go to work,” Weidlich said. “And he comes down from upstairs holding onto the wall. He goes, ‘Daddy, I can’t see.’ And I’m looking at him, and he’s got one eye at me and one eye off.”
The family rushed Stevie to the hospital, where they learned he had a type of growth called a cavernous malformation inside his brainstem. He had emergency brain surgery the next day to remove the growth.

The surgery was successful, but it affected Stevie’s equilibrium and required him to start using a wheelchair.
In 2006, the family relocated to Unity, New Hampshire, where Weidlich’s father lived. Stevie had been “falling between the cracks with school,” Weidlich said, and his wife was struggling with an opioid addiction.
“I decided to fall back, regroup, put my wife in rehab, and we found this place,” he said. “I moved everybody up here.”
In New Hampshire, Stevie was able to regain the ability to walk without a wheelchair through rehabilitation services. However, about a year later he started losing his balance again, so the Weidlichs brought him to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, where doctors discovered the growth was returning. The family brought Stevie back to New York for a second surgery in 2010. This time, doctors clipped a nerve.
“So he went into it being able to walk,” Weidlich said. “And came out of it not being able to walk anymore.”
Stevie was diagnosed with mild intellectual and developmental disabilities, and he began having behavioral issues.
“The second surgery affected him much more,” Weidlich said. “He’d have anger issues, and he’d just be frustrated.”
After Stevie left Crotched Mountain in 2017, PathWays placed him with a live-in caretaker named Prashanna Sangroula. Weidlich’s work schedule made him unable to give his son the 24/7 care he required, so PathWays provided residential care. Stevie and several others with disabilities lived happily in a house with Sangroula and Sangroula’s family. The young man would come home to Unity every other weekend and on holidays. The family loved Sangroula.
When the Sangroulas moved to Virginia, however, PathWays needed to find a new live-in caregiver. With Stevie’s behavioral issues and need for constant supervision, Weidlich said he was under no illusions about just how challenging that would be.
For a while, Stevie bounced among temporary caretakers until PathWays found him a more permanent home with Onkundi in Allenstown in October 2021.
Stephen Weidlich Sr. served in the army during the Persian Gulf War, something his son always admired about him. Stevie, who made this art project for his father, wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the military himself. Crystal Weidlich, his stepmother, said: “He’d always joke, ‘They’re gonna build me a mecha-suit so I can walk and fight.’”
‘A lack of consequences’

The state investigation from the Bureau of Adult and Aging Services concluded that Onkundi had committed neglect. However, the bureau didn’t finalize that finding until November 2024, nearly two years after Stevie’s death. Onkundi is now legally ineligible to be a caregiver of people with disabilities, but in the nearly two years between Stevie’s death and that finding, he would’ve been legally permitted to work for PathWays or another agency. It’s unclear whether he did so. Onkundi did not answer the Bulletin’s phone calls, voicemails, or text messages.
PathWays didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. 
No criminal charges have been filed against Onkundi and the Attorney General’s Office concluded its investigation into Onkundi, the office told the Bulletin. The case has been kicked back down to the Allenstown Police Department, which doesn’t have legal authority to file manslaughter or murder charges but does have authority for lesser offenses. The Attorney General’s Office refused to answer the Bulletin’s questions about the case because the investigation is ongoing at the local level.

“Investigations of this nature can take time and may move between local law enforcement, county prosecutors, and this office depending on the circumstances,” Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, wrote in an email. “Investigating agencies cannot rush to judgment, but follow the evidence and the facts wherever they lead. Any prosecution must be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That standard is imposed on us by the law and professional ethics.”
Weidlich and Stevie’s stepmother, Crystal, now feel left in the dark. 
When he learned there would be no murder or manslaughter charges, Weidlich was angry. Allenstown police seemed serious about the investigation and kept them updated early on, he said, but as the attorney general got involved and time passed, they heard less and less. Still, he’s holding out hope that Allenstown police will file some sort of charges.
In the meantime, Weidlich has filed a lawsuit against PathWays and Onkundi, among others.
There were other apparent lapses in oversight, too.
The Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adult Fatality Review Committee is a board of experts established through state law to review concerning deaths of vulnerable or incapacitated people, evaluating if there were any failures in state policy or practices that led to the death. The board then makes recommendations on how to prevent future similar deaths.
A photo of Stephen Weidlich Jr. hangs on the wall of the Weidlich family home. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Both co-chairs of that committee, Vanessa Blais and Francesca Broderick, told the Bulletin Stevie’s death was never brought before the committee. Agencies like the Bureau of Aging and Adult Services and Department of Health and Human Services — which both knew of the death and have representatives on the committee — aren’t legally obligated to report deaths to the committee. They’re merely encouraged. Still, when the Bulletin told her about Stevie’s death, Blais said she was shocked it hadn’t been brought to her committee.
Attorneys Kristin Ross and Cristina Rousseau, who are representing Weidlich in his lawsuit and have represented multiple families in this system, said tragedies like Stevie’s are symptomatic of a broken system.
“Really what we see is a lack of accountability and a lack of consequences when things go wrong within the area agency system, and frankly I think that starts at the top,” Ross said. “There are regulations that are supposed to be being followed, but what we find is they’re not, and there’s no consequences, and there’s a very laissez-faire attitude about the fact that they’re not being followed.”
Cristina Rousseau
In Stevie’s case, Rousseau noted the entire investigation focused on Onkundi.
“But you know what has never happened in any of the cases we’ve been involved (with)?” Rousseau said. “The area agencies are not investigated. They are the ones that have all of these duties, and when it comes to violations that have occurred, nobody looks at PathWays.”
Rousseau and Ross also point to what they consider a perverse financial incentive within the system of care.
“Something that we’ve seen is a pushback against allowing immediate family members to become the approved in-home care providers,” Ross said. “And instead a push towards individuals outside of the family.”
Agencies and caregivers earn significantly more money providing residential care than day services. According to PathWays’ contract with Onkundi, acquired by the Bulletin, Onkundi was paid more than $5,000 per month and more than $62,000 annually to care for Stevie. Had he been providing day services, he would’ve been paid about $1,400 a month and $17,000 annually, according to the contract.

“Everyone is always so concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse,” Ross said. “We are literally giving the state evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse within our very own state agency system, and nobody’s doing anything about it.”
Rousseau said the absence of state action is perplexing.
Kristin Ross
“You would think that somebody in the state would maybe want to take a look at this,” she said. “But they don’t even look at it. They just continue to pay and engage and give contracts to these area agencies after these issues have come to light. … The fact a civil lawsuit ends up being the vehicle to get answers for a family whose son died and froze to death in the care of somebody approved by the state tells me we are dealing with an incredibly broken, broken system.”
Before Stevie went to live with Onkundi, he told a case manager some of his hopes for the future, all of which were outlined in the service agreement as things for him to work toward with the help of his care team. He wanted a job, his own apartment near his family, and a romantic relationship one day.
 “You know, he wanted to have a girlfriend,” his father said. “He wanted a normal life.”

The Senate votes Thursday. If all goes as planned, the legislature will put four bills on the desk of Gov. Ned Lamont by Friday, setting the stage for the Democrat to formally launch his campaign for a third term with a degree of momentum, if not without challenges to address in the regular session in February.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday he will open the session with a debate on the revised version of House Bill 5002, an omnibus housing bill Lamont unexpectedly vetoed in June after the regular session, siding with Republican opponents and infuriating Democratic supporters.
“It will start bumpy, and it will land more smoothly,” Ritter said of the day. He noted that any measure pressuring suburbs to allow more multi-family housing “remains kind of an issue that divides the parties, frankly, in our chamber.” No Republican voted for H.B. 5002.

And I think that Republicans stepped to the plate to meet that moment and to help our residents. It’s a whole other thing to start pushing agenda items that not only aren’t emergent in nature, but I think were already hotly contested in the regular session.”
The special session coincides with the U.S. House returning to Washington after nearly a two-month absence to vote on reopening the federal government, a step that takes away the sense of urgency, at least among Republicans, to empower the governor to subsidize federal hunger, nutrition and home heating programs.
Despite opposition by President Donald J. Trump to states offering alternative funding during the shutdown, leaders of the Republican minorities in the General Assembly had voiced support for giving Lamont authority to spend state funds for SNAP and WIC food assistance and LIHEAP heating funding.
“I don’t think you’re going to get as much bipartisan support on this funding now that the shutdown is ending and SNAP is restored,” Harding said.
Prior to the shutdown, Democrats had urged the governor to call a special session to increase state budget reserves in anticipation of needing to meet federal cuts that were passed in July in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but will not be felt fully until after the midterm elections in 2026.
One of the bills up for a vote Wednesday will give the governor emergency authority to exceed the spending cap and raise the ceiling on the state’s rainy day fund by $500 million. It now has $4.3 billion, the maximum allowed by the statutory limit of 18% of the general fund.
With the shutdown in mind, the bill gives Lamont authority to draw from the budget reserves within certain parameters until the regular session begins on Feb. 4.
“Look, the $500 million is a safety net. ‘On again, off again.’ You never knew what the federal government was doing,” Lamont said. “That was loud and clear when it came to SNAP. We had six different directives in seven different days. Maybe they’re going to solve the shutdown over the next 48 hours. Little less need for the $500 million at that point, but at least we have the backstop if we need it.”
Decisions on how to use the $500 million most likely won’t be made until the regular session. 
Even if federal funding of SNAP is restored, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tightened the eligibility requirements, most likely denying about 10% of the 366,000 recipients aid over the next three months. A more expensive loss to address are expiring subsidies that make health insurance affordable on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.
Those could cost $350 million annually, Ritter said at a press conference Monday.
“So, you got to be more careful about the Big Beautiful Bill cuts, but we’re going to make sure that nobody vulnerable gets left behind,” Lamont said Tuesday after a press conference at Waterbury Hospital.

A third bill scheduled for a vote Wednesday would enable UConn Health to purchase and make improvements at Waterbury Hospital, then operate it under a public private partnership. The fourth bill was a legislative catch-all, with provisions on childhood mental health, a funding mechanism for a cancer fund, and limits on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can operate around courthouses and access health data.
The immigration measure is expected to get pushback from Republicans, who have accused Democrats of hindering federal law enforcement operations.
Lamont and Comptroller Sean Scanlon, who helped negotiate the Waterbury deal, said the state must do more to stabilize affordable health care.
With Lamont’s support, Scanlon has been working on a public health insurance option, reviving an effort Scanlon first made as a state lawmaker in 2019. The governor and comptroller promise to roll out details in the near future, most likely with an eye towards legislative action next year.
“There’s two prongs in health care right now: The cost of delivering it costs too much, and the insurance that covers that care is covering too little,” Scanlon said. “And the small group market that helps a lot of people insure, that is dying. And so I think what the governor’s strategy is going forward is a multi-pronged approach to make sure that everyone in Connecticut has access to care through affordable insurance, and that everyone that goes to use that insurance can get affordable, low cost, but high quality care.”
Candelora complained Tuesday that lawmakers would be returning to Hartford on Wednesday without seeing fully vetted legislation. Lamont and Democratic lawmakers released a summary of the housing bill on Friday.
He objected to a provision that would allow housing to be built as of right in commercial zones.
“You know, local zoning is there for a reason, but we are prioritizing housing over commercial needs that help support a tax base, but also enhance the quality of communities,” Candelora said.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said the revised bill allows for greater influence than the original over housing that could go in commercial zones.
“We did it with parameters” suggested by local officials, Rojas said. One change, he said, is that housing can be built as a right in commercial zones, but not as a conversion of existing commercial buildings.
In vetoing the original bill, that was one of the provisions Lamont had applauded.
“Commercial ‘as of right’ makes really good sense to me,” Lamont said. “Rather than have an empty, underused office building, people can convert that, do that, you know, more quickly and readily. But I think we have to do it the way that people buy in.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0522_SR_Session_180-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Five hundred in Ogunquit, another 700 in Damariscotta and Portland, and a packed theater in Bath last week. Despite a running list of foul-mouthed controversies and staffing defections, Graham Platner is still drawing crowds — and Maine’s political establishment needs to recognize why.
It’s possible that voters have more tolerance for bigotry — or at least bigoted language — in a predominantly white, rural state. But I don’t think that is what is going on here, and the impulse among outsiders to dismiss Platner’s popularity this way ignores a much more urgent dynamic that captures how many voters are feeling right now: fed up.
To recap, in Platner’s most publicized comments, made in Reddit forums spanning nearly a decade — reported in local and national outlets days after Democratic Party-favorite Maine Gov. Janet Mills entered the race — he’s been shown to dismiss military sexual assaults, question Black patrons’ tipping habits, demean LGBTQ+ people, and criticize police officers and rural Americans, while advocating for the potential need to take up arms against facism. 
And there’s the question of the tattoo, which he said he got in 2007 while partying with fellow Marines overseas, and the ongoing ambiguity over when he realized it closely resembled a Totenkopf, the symbol of the Nazi Schutzstaffel, or SS, police unit. 
For many, these symbols and statements are beyond the pale and underscore how little is known about the man who does not have a political record to lean on when making the case that those views do not represent the person he is today.
But reporting on thousands of other comments that Platner made between July 2009 and November 2021 paints a more complex picture.
In the posts, the oyster farmer coarsely rails against racism, facism, American imperialism and the political establishment. 
He said homophobia is “indefensible” and described the military’s discriminatory treatment of same-sex spouses as “pretty goddamn disgusting.” According to socialist magazine Jacobin, he blasted a Republican U.S. House candidate for saying that police will only shoot a Black person who “needs to be shot,” calling him a “racist motherf***er,” and complained that no one cared about handgun violence because “nobody really gives a sh*t about things until it’s well spoken white kids getting hurt.”
There are many such examples.
‘Washington need not apply:’ How Mainers are evaluating controversy-laden Graham Platner

And for many Mainers, who are not just reading mainstream political coverage of the old posts but who are listening to his speeches and statements today, they have an alternative view of Platner, and it is one they have decided they can still get behind.
“I needed to question this notion of: Is he authentic or not?” South Portland resident Frank Smith recently told reporter Emma Davis. “When I heard his responses, I mean, he owned what happened. He dealt with it honestly. He didn’t misdirect or obfuscate, and I think that says a tremendous amount for an individual, especially politicians.”
For Platner’s fans, these events have become part of a narrative, in which a regular (ie. white, straight) American Joe sacrificed himself for his nation and came home broken and disaffected; who gradually healed with the help of community, connection and Veterans Affairs benefits, and is now taking on the establishment, which is bent on destroying him.
His candidacy does not fit in a very tidy box, but it is telling that many of his supporters find his past statements abhorrent and still prefer him to the Democratic Party status quo.
A look at Janet Mills
In an Oct. 20 social media post, community organizer Safiya Khalid highlighted why she is sticking with Platner, articulating a theme I’ve seen voiced repeatedly — that his popularity has almost as much to do with Mills as it does with him.
“The truth is the bar in politics has been set low for a long time, not because of new candidates like Graham but because those already in power keep failing to deliver real change,” wrote Khalid, who in 2019 was the first Somali-American elected to the Lewiston City Council and later stepped away from politics due to racist comments she was subject to both during her campaign and later from within her own party. 
“I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different,” she said. “Maine deserves new energy, real accountability, and a leader who actually listens.”
Mills, whose record includes many mainstream bonafides like fighting for abortion rights and expanding health care access, gained national prominence for taking on the Trump administration over its attacks on transgender students. But a closer look at her policies reveals how time and again she angered many Democratic voters.
Khalid pointed specifically to the governor’s 2021 veto of a bill that would have closed the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state’s last youth prison, as well as more recent actions such as postponing her decision on a bill that would restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, and coming out against a ballot referendum to institute a red flag law, which ultimately passed last week with 62% of the vote.
But Mills has blocked even more popular proposals, such as legislation to restore tribal sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations, not just breaking from Democrats but a growing bipartisan consensus that it’s “the right f***ing thing to do,” as Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Troy Jackson put it.










I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different.

The governor has also vetoed more than a half dozen bills that would improve labor standards — including multiple efforts to include farmworkers in the state minimum wage, a measure that finally passed this spring — which is likely what drove labor groups to recruit Platner to run against her.
Mills also axed several proposals to reform the state’s criminal code at a time when the public defense system is in crisis and hundreds of low-income Mainers are being held in jail without representation.
In a recent column about Platner, Shay Stewart Bouley, a writer and former elected official who runs a Boston-based racial justice organization (and who has written for Maine Morning Star), wrote that while his comments “are bad, racism is ultimately about power and privilege that favors white people and exploits and oppresses Black folks and other people of color.” She notes that Mills “has an actual track record when it comes to communities of color and marginalized folks … that is far less than stellar.”

Even the issue that propelled Mills into the national consciousness, transgender rights, the governor argued was more about states’ rights and later said Maine’s policy allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports was “worthy of debate” — not exactly a ride-or-die pronouncement.
Mills has built her Senate campaign around her record of standing up to President Donald Trump, the accomplishments of her two terms in the Blaine House, and her ability to win a statewide race — something only four other Democrats have done in the past 50 years. No small potatoes. 
But, she’s only managed to issue milquetoast critiques of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican and her actual opponent in the race, and doesn’t have much to say about the broader system or structures that enabled this moment.
And then there is the issue of age. Mills is a septuagenarian and, if elected, would be the oldest incoming freshman senator in history. And while no one is questioning her ability to lead, she represents an era of politicians seen as out of touch at best and, at worst, complicit in defending the status quo that helped propel Trump to power.
“I’d like to see politics more in the hands of younger generations of people,” Bill DeLong of Biddeford told Davis. “It’s not working right now.”
‘A new kind of politics’?
Regardless of your political leanings, it has been a tough few years for the vast majority of Americans, and I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that there is an absence of hope. 
It is in that void that Platner has been able to flourish. With a platform focused on ending the influence of money in politics, enacting Medicare for All, increasing taxes on billionaires, passing federal anti-discrimination legislation, developing federal child care policy, implementing congressional term limits, taking on Pentagon waste and corruption and ending “pointless” wars including what he described as the genocide in Gaza, among other positions, he’s struck a nerve with young people and other voters who have felt ignored by leaders of both dominant parties.
“Everyone in Maine — Republican or Democrat, Trump supporter or progressive — when you walk around this state, you ask any working person in the state, ‘Do you think that you live in a system — a political system, an economic system — that has your best interest at heart?’ Nobody says yes to that,” Platner told the crowd during an October town hall event in Collins’ hometown Caribou. 
Another Senate candidate drops out to endorse Mills as Platner controversies stack up

Platner has said he wants to build a movement that can help organize people around a “new kind of politics.” And he’s painted himself as the former Marine who can take a beating from the powers that be to help usher in that era of change.
Much to the chagrin of national Democratic leaders looking to pick up Maine’s Senate seat in the midterm elections, the primary is proving to be a bigger headache than they likely anticipated. But it is the same dynamic playing out across the country, with voters on the left increasingly dissatisfied with the same old playbook and the same old people.
For Mainers, the Senate primary race cuts too close to other elections in recent memory where it felt as if an invisible force was pushing back against the tide of popular sentiment, such as President Joe Biden’s attempt at reelection in 2024, or former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon’s failed bid to oust Collins in 2020, or even Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders — who won the state’s 2016 Democratic presidential caucus by a landslide. Maine voters are sick of being told who to vote for.
There are others in the race, namely former congressional aide Jordan Wood, but state leaders shouldn’t have been so quick to clear the field for Mills, leaving voters with a choice primarily between someone with too much baggage and too little experience, and someone they see as having helped build the system they are now buckling under.
Platner has said this campaign “is not just about beating Susan Collins” or “flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side,” but rather “it is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.”
Whatever happens with the campaign, it seems that his candidacy has already given voice to some deep frustrations among voters. Leaders would be wise to listen.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)The United States was founded on the idea that government exists to serve its people. To do this, government must deliver services that promote the common good. When the government shuts down, it fails to meet its fundamental purpose.
While government shutdowns are not new in the U.S., most have lasted less than a week. At 40 days, the current shutdown may well be on the way to an end this week, as enough Senate Democratic caucus members have voted with Republicans on a measure to reopen the government. But it will remain the longest in the history of the nation.
When the government shuts down for such a long time, it inflicts hardships, anxieties and irritations on its citizens. You might wonder why elected officials allow lengthy disruptions to happen.
It is common to blame the politicians for the shutdown. However, as a philosopher who researches democracy, I think the fault lies also with us, the citizens. In a democracy, we generally get the politics we ask for, and the electorate has developed a taste for political spectacle over competent leadership.
American democracy has grown increasingly tribal, leading us to become more invested in punishing our partisan rivals than in demanding competent government. We are infatuated with the spectacle of our side dominating the other.
Understandably, politicians have embraced obstruction. They have learned that deadlock can pay, because they have the support of their voters in behaving this way. Politics is no longer about representation and policy, it’s now about vanquishing and even humiliating the other side.
 
More fervent, not better informed
To see this, we must examine polarization. Let’s start by distinguishing two kinds of polarization.
First is political polarization. It measures the divide between the U.S.’s two major parties. When political polarization is severe, the common ground among the parties falls away. This naturally undermines cooperation. That Republicans and Democrats are politically polarized is certainly part of the explanation for the shutdown.
But that’s not the entire story. As I argue in my book “Civic Solitude,” the deeper trouble has to do with belief polarization.
Unlike political polarization, which measures the distance between opposing groups, belief polarization occurs within a single group. In belief polarization, like-minded people transform into more extreme version of themselves: Liberals become more liberal, conservatives become more conservative, Second Amendment advocates become more pro-gun, environmentalists become more green, and so on.
Importantly, this shift is driven by the desire to fit in with one’s peers, not by evidence or reason. Hence, we become more fervent but no better informed.
Additionally, our more extreme selves are also more tribal and conformist. As we shift, we become more antagonistic toward outsiders. We also become more insistent on uniformity within our group, less tolerant of differences.
 
Animosity and obstruction
The combination of intensifying antagonism toward those on the “other side” and escalating cohesion among those on “your side” turns all aspects of life into politics.
In the U.S. today, liberals and conservatives are heavily socially segregated. They live in different neighborhoods, work in different professions, vacation in different locations, drive different vehicles and shop in different stores. Everyday behavior has become an extension of partisan affiliation.
Ironically, as everyday life becomes politically saturated, politics itself becomes more about lifestyle and less about policy. Research suggests that while animosity across the parties has intensified significantly, citizens’ disagreements over policy have either remained stable or eased. We dislike one another more intensely yet are not more divided.
This paints a grim portrait of U.S. democracy. Note that this condition incentivizes politicians to amplify their contempt for political rivals. Politicians seek to win elections, and stoking negative feelings such as fear and indignation are potent triggers of political behavior, including voting.
Consequently, when citizens are belief-polarized, animosity and obstruction become winning electoral strategies. Meanwhile, politicians are released from the task of serving the common good.
 
Channeling contempt

It is no surprise that discussions of the shutdown have consistently focused on blame.
The Republicans, who hold the congressional majority, have sought to score points by depicting the shutdown as the Democrats’ fault. Several official websites maintained by the federal government included statements denouncing the shutdown as strictly the doing of the Democrats. Their aim has been to channel citizens’ frustration into contempt for the Democratic Party.
At the beginning of the shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed that there was “literally nothing to negotiate” with congressional Democrats.
But there’s the rub. Democratic government is fundamentally a matter of negotiation. Neither winning an election nor being a member of the majority party means that you can simply call the shots. The constitutional procedures by which our representatives govern are designed to force cooperation, collaboration and compromise.
Thanks to polarization, however, these noble ideals of political give-and-take have dissolved. Cooperation is now seen as surrender to political enemies. That’s very clear in many Democrats’ outraged reactions to the eight senators from their caucus who have now voted with Republicans to end the shutdown.
Meanwhile, more than 1 million government employees haven’t been paid, many crucial government services have been interrupted, diminished or suspended, and, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, travelers are experiencing flight disruptions. While there may be an end to the shutdown on the near horizon, any deal could simply postpone crucial policy debates and could well end in another shutdown in the new year.
The key to avoiding this kind of failure is to become a citizenry that demands competent government over partisan domination.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)If Ohio was a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump World, faithfully executing the corrupt orders of an unforgiving boss, would Ohioans even blink an eye? 
Trumpian taskmasters in the Ohio Statehouse already execute public policy based on the dictates of the MAGA king. So, what is the difference? 
Unquestioning obedience to the convicted felon drove Ohio Republicans (with obliging Democrats) to intensify congressional district manipulation and give Trump the gerrymandered advantage he demanded ahead of the 2026 elections. 
The boss also ordered red states to make it harder for voters to cast ballots in the midterms. Less turnout is less threatening. Trump fears the results of a referendum on his regime. 
The Ohio Senate is in his corner. 
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, as usual, leads the anti-voter brigade on the pretense of election integrity. 
She doesn’t even come up with new excuses to erect barriers to voting anymore. 
The Bowling Green Republican, behind one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, longs to get on right-wing radar by going more extreme than MAGA Republicans in Congress to disenfranchise voters with made-up election fraud remedies unsupported by evidence.  
Last week, the Ohio Senate passed one of Gavarone’s bills in record time. But Ohio Senate Bill 293 was a rush order from Trump World. 
It came with an explicit warning: get rid of mail-in voting or risk the wrath of Trump’s Department of Justice in court. 
The only U.S. president who conspired to overturn an election he lost, with lies about widespread mail ballot fraud, is laying the groundwork to delegitimize another election with the same fantastical and false claims about vote-by-mail fraud. 
He is again sowing baseless doubts about secure mail-in voting systems used by nearly 1 in 3 Americans in 2024. 
All it took for Ohio Senate Republicans to go along was a little federal pressure/extortion. 
For no compelling reason, they voted to stop counting legitimate mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day in Trump-friendly legislation that mirrored his legally shaky executive order in March. 
The EO decreed ballots received post-election invalid and commanded voters produce birth certificates or passports as proof of eligibility — to create unwarranted obstacles for millions of Americans who simply want to vote. 
Gavarone co-sponsored correlating legislation, Ohio Senate Bill 153, to impose the same burden on Ohioans. 
It appears to be on the fast track for passage. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, Ohio Senate Bill 293 is headed to the Ohio House to become another voter suppression law in the state. 
It would arbitrarily eliminate the mail-in ballot “grace period” in Ohio and cause legal ballots to be thrown out. 
But the eminently absurd Gavarone insisted, “we want all valid votes to count, and the process needs to be done on Election Day” or we will turn into pumpkins at the close of polls. 
Republican lawmakers who previously shortened the deadline (from 10 to four days) in which those late-arriving ballots, postmarked by Election Day, were counted now embrace Trump’s edict not to process any ballot received past Election Day — lest unchecked power be checked by incoming ballots. 
In 2024, almost 10,000 mail-in ballots from eligible Ohio voters arrived in the four-day window that would be eliminated in SB 293. 
That’s 10,000 citizens, enough to flip a race, summarily disenfranchised. 
Tough luck if you’re a registered voter in good standing, particularly one who is elderly or disabled or lives in rural areas, and postal delays beyond your control cancel your vote. 
It’s crazy. Over a million Ohioans used mail-in ballots to vote in the last presidential election. That’s about 17% of the nearly 5,900,000 votes cast. 
More registered Republicans voted by mail in Ohio in 2024, than Democrats did. 
Voters 65 and older, Ohio’s biggest age demographic, were far and away the biggest users of mail-in voting, returning roughly 520,000 ballots by mail a year ago. 
Why not vote from the convenience of home and bypass lines at the polls? 
Voting by mail, which surged to record rates in the 2020 election, is still pretty popular and a majority of Americans favor allowing the option to make it safer, easier and more reliable for people to cast ballots. 
They don’t buy Trump’s ravings about mail voting fraud which, in truth, is exceedingly rare. 
But after Democratic victories in off-year elections last week Trump again railed baselessly about “rigged” mail voting and called on congressional Republicans to ban it outright “except for military, far away military, and people that are very sick.”  
He is seeding the ground for rejection of midterm election results he doesn’t like in a throwback to 2020. 
We’ve seen this movie before. 
Ohioans should know the part their Statehouse politicians are playing in the Trump sequel, how they dutifully execute legislative assaults on voting rights (or else) to enable rule by fiat not the ballot box.
So is the Statehouse is working for Trump World instead of us? 
Mia Lewis, of Common Cause Ohio, asked Trumpian taskmasters directly in recent testimony against SB 293. 
“Senator Gavarone often asks, ‘Isn’t even just one instance of fraudulent vote too many?’ Of course. It could theoretically skew the result. Luckily, this is so vanishingly rare it has not had and could not have had any impact. But if someone who is eligible to vote — who wants to vote, does everything legally to vote — if they have their voted ballot cast aside uncounted, isn’t that too many, Senator Gavarone?”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Parking enforcement at UConn: Perhaps unpopular, but fair and necessary",Andy Kelly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/parking-enforcement-on-college-campuses-perhaps-unpopular-but-fair-and-necessary/,"UConn Parking Services is self-supporting, with its operations funded solely by permit sales, event parking fees, and citation payments.","Two quick facts, only one of which is true:
The first vehicle in Storrs was a 4.5-horsepower Mobile Steamer, driven in 1904 by a mechanical arts instructor at the nascent Connecticut Agricultural College. Within an hour of parking on campus, he’d already received a citation.
The second sentence is, of course, completely false – but given the sensitivities surrounding parking on college campuses, maybe you paused for a moment and entertained that it might contain a nugget of truth.
That’s OK. Parking permits and enforcement on the University of Connecticut’s campuses isn’t the stuff of groundbreaking scientific research, high graduation rates, or championship athletic banners. But it’s a necessary piece of the puzzle that helps UConn achieve those and other goals, and an obligation we approach in the spirit of ensuring fairness amid space constraints.
A recent op-ed in this publication expressed opinions about the process as it relates to commuter students, calling it “punitive and costly” and “an important revenue source” for the university.
Let’s break down the revenues. UConn Parking Services is self-supporting, with its operations funded solely by permit sales, event parking fees, and citation payments. It doesn’t draw from tuition or state funds, and has no impact on academic operations, deficit mitigation, or other parts of the university budget.
However, it does move the needle in a notable way: Net proceeds are transferred annually to the university specifically to help fund financial aid, to the tune of more than $500,000 in a typical fiscal year. Many millions of dollars have been paid to UConn over the years, and in turn allocated to needy students through their financial aid packages.
Gross proceeds from citations, permits, and event parking fees go directly to operation and maintenance of the parking system and repayment of the UConn 2000 bonded debt used to build the South Garage.
In terms of fairness, parking enforcement is necessary to help ensure that UConn’s students, faculty, and staff have access to the spaces for which they bought permits. People who either park without permits or repeatedly violate the rules are taking spaces away from those who reasonably expect to use them.
None of this is to say we’re not sympathetic to the stresses of our students, of course, given the classes, work obligations, and other duties that so many of them juggle. In fact, to encourage voluntary compliance, thousands of the citations issued each year are warnings that carry no fines.
The new “boot” wheel immobilizer deployed this year at Storrs has also received attention, but it’s simply a helpful way of addressing cases when a driver has allowed more than $200 in fines to accrue.

People who receive citations can also file appeals online, in person, or by mail – and if they are denied, they can appeal that denial if additional facts are available that might be pertinent.
We also work closely with our partners in the Windham Region Transit District regarding on-campus and regional bus availability; with the state Department of Transportation for the U-Pass that lets students ride its public transportation services without fares; and with UConn Police in their efforts to help ensure the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooter users.
A lot has changed since 1904, when Professor J.N. Fitts introduced the automobile to Storrs.
About 13,000 parking spaces are now on campus, with about 85% of them in use during peak periods. Since that demand can be unevenly distributed across campus, we recently launched the new Modii Smart Parking Finder on our website.
Simply put: It’s very reasonable for students, faculty, and staff with permits to expect access to one of those spaces. But to help make that happen, it’s necessary for UConn to consistently enforce parking rules, getting non-complaint vehicles moving so permit-holders get what they’re paying for.

In a YouGov poll of Connecticut votes released on Nov. 6 , acting to solve the housing crisis with real solutions was found to carry with it are likely to receive a 30 point net favorability boost. In other words, voters are watching Connecticut fail to act on the boiling housing crisis, and (when given the choice), they are voting for leaders who will.
In case you missed it, Connecticut just had an election. While there was much focus on some larger races that flipped seats, let me focus on just a few smaller races that prove this poll result is worth more than the paper it is written on:

In Fairfield, a town artificially divided over several controversial 8-30g projects, voters decisively backed a pro-housing slate for the Planning and Zoning Commission. The result flipped the board to a Democratic majority and ousted noted NIMBY activist Alexis Harrison, who has long denied the obvious truth: Connecticut has a shortage of homes.
In Newington, the recently re-elected mayor was accosted while door knocking to do something to improve the housing shortage. Newington has for decades been a “build nothing, deny everything” kind of town. That is no longer politically palatable.
Manchester: Mayor Jay Moran was just re-elected with 70% of the vote. Why? He has a vision for more housing and a better safer Main Street. A small faction of residents want to cling to the past, have launched petitions, lawsuits, public pressure campaign. And through it all Mayor Moran has not backed down, rather he has stood firm in his vision of a better future and is widely admired for it.

This dynamic extends far beyond Connecticut:

In New York City, voters approved three ballot measures to speed permitting and construction of new housing.
In Cambridge, MA, the city council passed a significant reimagination of their city’s zoning in early 2025 to welcome new housing and provide a price relief valve. This election, seven incumbents who passed that reform were re-elected with the vice mayor, the primary champion of that reform receiving the most votes. One of the challengers just elected was a recent college grad who ran on going even further on addressing the housing crisis.
In Salem, MA all seven candidates who ran on a platform of housing affordability were elected, including 5 first time candidates. This is after the city recently abolished parking mandates for new residential buildings just a few weeks before the election
Famously anti-development Marin County, CA has a housing zoning ballot measure leading in early vote counting.

There are hundreds of other examples across the country of exactly this dynamic. Politicians who care about housing affordability, housing choice, and can not only articulate it well but act on those beliefs are widely lauded and rewarded with electoral landslides.
I remain struck by a speech recently given by the Governor of North Dakota, Kelly Armstrong at the YIMBYtown conference held in New Haven. There he said, and let me paraphrase: There is a difference between a political discomfort and a political liability. Sure you might get yelled at but society doesn’t work without there being enough housing. You just need to state clearly why it is necessary and pursue it.
If there is one thing both polling and election results is clear about, action taken to solve the housing supply crisis will be handsomely rewarded.

A commission studying the possibility of changes in Maryland held its first hearing Tuesday. (Screenshot)The first meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Tuesday was short and to the point — if the point was that there are still a lot of questions surrounding the commission’s work and not much time to answer them.
The five-member commission met virtually for a little over a half-hour in an organizational meeting that included almost 20 minutes of a primer on the Census from Maryland Department of Planning officials.
They spoke in general about shifts in state population from the 2010 to the 2020 Census, and the changes since then in annual Census surveys — although Planning Deputy Secretary Kristin Fleckenstein said the newer numbers cannot be used for redistricting. Any redrawing of congressional boundaries would have to be based on the actual 2020 Census numbers, the same data that was used for last redistricting, in 2022.
Most of the rest of the commission’s brief meeting was spent discussing the number and format of meetings, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), a commission member, asking if the panel planned in-person meetings and how many. He noted that the last redistricting commission, in 2021, was required to “go to all parts of the state to maintain … constitutional validity.”
U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), the commission chair, said meetings for now would be virtual, with people given the opportunity to testify, while the commission worked to secure locations for in-person meetings if necessary. Alsobrooks said she hopes to get in two more meetings before Thanksgiving, including one scheduled for 4:30 p.m. this Friday.
In this first round of hearings, Alsobrooks said, the commission is just planning to listen to voters to see how they want the state to proceed with redistricting, if they want it it to proceed at all..
Moore defends redistricting as effort to ensure fairness; Republicans prepare to go to court

“Working together over the next month or so, we’re going to listen to Marylanders from across the state on whether Maryland should redraw its congressional lines, and what that map would look like,” she said at the outset of the meeting.
Without setting a specific timeline, or other hearing dates, Alsobrooks said she hoped the commission could work “quickly, to give the governor and the legislature the time they need to should they choose to draw new lines.”
The panel will have to work quickly: The General Assembly convenes two months from Friday, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays to work around in that time.
Alsobrooks said the commission would decide Friday how many in-person meetings will be held. Those meetings, she said, will be to “solicit feedback from Marylanders regarding whether or not they want this redistricting to happen.”
Both Alsobrooks and Fleckenstein said there are no proposed new congressional maps for people to respond to, that any such documents would not come until it’s been decided that redistricting is the way to go.
That is far from a settled question among lawmakers, who would have to approve any new district maps.
Redistricting is typically done ever 10 years, after the decennial census, when the number of seats in Congress is redistributed among the states based on their populations, and the states redraw districts to reflect population shifts within their states.
That tradition was upended this year when Texas, at the urging of President Donald Trump, redistricted midcycle to create a map that is expected to give Republicans five more seats in Congress after the 2026 elections. Other states soon followed suit, both Republican and Democratic, with pressure from the national parties for states to get on board.
Some Maryland lawmakers have talked about redistricting since earlier this year, when Texas made its move. But Gov. Wes Moore made it official last week, when he appointed the commission to study whether Maryland’s congressional maps are fair — acknowledging that he was motivated in part by the “attack on our democracy” by the GOP redistrictings.
In Maryland, there is little to gain for Democrats, who already hold seven of the state’s eight House seats. That has been pointed out by critic, who say the state has much more to lose if its redistricting plans are rejected by a court or if the new boundaries weaken any of the seven seats that Democrats now hold. That could result in the party actually losing seats to the GOP, critics say.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One of those critics is Ferguson, who circulated a letter recently on behalf of his 34-member Democratic caucus saying it was opposed to a mid-decade redistricting. But Moore and supporters have vowed to press on.
Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, the only Republican member of the commission, asked at the end of Tuesday’s meeting what exactly was broken with the districts that needs to be fixed.
“Has anybody stated what the actual problem is that we’re looking to fix?” he asked. “I’m all in here, but I’m trying to figure out what the problem is.”
Alsobrooks said that’s the goal of the first round of meetings, to hear from Marylanders who will look at the current maps and weigh in on the current configuration of maps.

Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks.","In summary
The federal government often makes deadlines on the Colorado River, but — in recent years — rarely has enforced them. Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks. 


After two fraught years of negotiations amid dire projections for the Colorado River’s reservoirs, California and six other states that rely on the river’s water have yet again failed to reach a deal — despite a federal deadline. 
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” the states said. The written statement released Tuesday included no details about how they plan to manage the river after the current rulebook expires at the end of next year. 
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal stewards for the river under the Department of the Interior, have threatened to impose their own plan in the absence of a deal. 
“Two years. And the lack of progress, in light of how perilous the conditions are on the Colorado — it’s unacceptable,” said Mark Gold, former director of Water Scarcity Solutions at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a board member of the Southern California water import giant, the Metropolitan Water District. 
The federal government frequently sets deadlines on the Colorado River, but it almost never enforces them. 
Negotiations now continue in advance of another, February deadline for a seven-state deal. Scott Cameron, acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, said in June that the goal is to “parachute” the states’ agreement into the ongoing federal planning process, in time to finalize a plan by May or June next year. 
Yet the states remain deadlocked even as the agreements that currently govern the river near expiration. 
Elizabeth Koebele, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, suspects that relationships between the states have become too fractured, and water too scarce, for deadlines to effectively motivate the warring states.  
“We have less water, and it’s caused more rippling problems,” Koebele told CalMatters. “You’re cutting a smaller pie, for more people.” 
Federal pressure or state collaboration?
A major conflict has been over how much each basin must cut back their use of the overtapped river, to close the ever-growing gap between dwindling supply and ravenous demand. 
California, Arizona, and Nevada in the lower basin offered in March 2024 to cut their use by up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water per year, depending on reservoir conditions. They urged Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico upstream to share any belt-tightening beyond that, but the upstream states balked — saying that their water users must already conserve water when dry conditions shrink the river’s flows. 
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s Upper Colorado River Commissioner, said that the states “remain committed to collaboration grounded in the best available science and respect for all Colorado River water users. We are taking a meaningful step toward long-term sustainability and demonstrating a shared determination to find supply-driven solutions.”
But Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has pressed the Trump administration to be more forceful in state negotiations. In a letter Tuesday to Trump’s Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Hobbs and Arizona legislative leaders called the upstream states’ negotiating position “extreme.” 
“We find it alarming that the Upper Basin States have repeatedly refused to implement any volume of binding, verifiable water supply reductions,” the letter said. 
Experts say there’s no time to waste; even the time it takes to develop a new plan for the river may be too long for its dwindling reservoirs. The Colorado River basin is suffering a climate change-fueled megadrought, and the basin’s major reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are each less than one-third full. 
California’s Colorado River use is on track this year to hit its lowest since 1949. Still, projections show another dry winter may yet send Lake Powell plunging below the levels needed to generate power by December 2026. 
The problem is that even when it rains or snows, runoff is disappearing into thirsty soils before it reaches the river. The paltry runoff keeps driving up estimates of the conservation required to stabilize the basin and its reservoirs. 
Jack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, and others have urged more urgent conservation in order to protect operations at the dams and ensure that water can be released from Lake Mead and Lake Powell. 
“We continue to drag our heels on not implementing additional cuts right now. That’s our fear: if it doesn’t snow this winter, we’ll really compromise the system,” Schmidt said. “We might get bailed out by a more decent winter, but that’s betting on a whole lot of hope.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/081322-Colorado-River-Water-Drought-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 22:58:05.275237

Michael Jackson (D-Prince George's, Calvert and attends a Prince George's County Council meeting Oct. 21. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Sen. Michael Jackson became Col. Michael Jackson at midnight Tuesday, taking over as superintendent of the Maryland State Police and kicking off a scramble to fill his District 27 Senate seat which represents parts of three Southern Maryland counties.
The transition marks the end of more than 10 years in the legislature for Jackson, almost five of which have been spent in the Senate. It also marks a return to law enforcement for Jackson, who served as president of the local Fraternal Order of Police from 1997-2002 and as Prince George’s County sheriff from 2002-2010.
“This is bittersweet,” Jackson said Tuesday as he packed up his Senate office — his photo had already been removed from the General Assembly website by Tuesday afternoon.
“There’s much more good work to be done .. always in the public safety arena, particularly with policing,” he said. “I’m proud of the work done as a legislator. I’m going to work hard for the state police. It’s the government police agency that keeps the entire state safe.”
Jackson, 61, takes over for Col. Roland Butler, who retired Nov. 1. Butler became the department’s first Black superintendent when he was sworn in in 2023 — over the objections of Jackson and three other Prince George’s County senators.
Opponents argued during a difficult confirmation battle that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers during his lengthy career with the agency, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau.
The U.S. Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation in 2022 into complaints of discrimination against Black and female applicants in the police agency’s written and physical hiring tests. Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle claims by 48 failed police applicants. Even though Justice determined any discrimination was unintentional, the State Police also agreed to revamp hiring tests and offer jobs to at least 25 of the 48 failed applicants.
Since the Maryland case was settled, however, President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jackson said that as superintendent, he plans a “step-by-step” assessment of the agency that include any lawsuits and other concerns. But he wants troopers to know that he is “not in the head-hunting business. I’m in the service business.”
“We have to be very careful not to make folks who are within the agency working hard every day …being blamed for whatever is going on,” Jackson said Tuesday. “We’re going to address any concerns that are out there. We’re going to make a full assessment.”
To help build relationships and assess resources that may be needed, Jackson would like his former legislative colleagues to visit the 23 state police barracks. He also said he would like to improve on the department’s community engagement, which he said he did during his tenure as Prince George’s County sheriff.
“You’re not going to just see [state troopers] writing tickets on the side of the road, or dealing with accidents, or dealing with Homeland Security matters or intelligence matters,” he said. “You’re going to see us in the community again.”
Musical chairs
Jackson will serve as acting secretary until he can be confirmed by the Senate. But his Senate seat comes open Wednesday.
In the Senate, Jackson served on the Budget and Taxation Committee, where he chaired the Pensions Subcommittee and the Public Safety, Transportation and Environment Subcommittee. Selection of his replacement will include input from each of the three county Democratic Central Committees in the district, Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties.
District 27 Dels. Kevin Harris and Jeffrie Long Jr. have so far expressed interest replacing Jackson. Harris represents District 27A, which includes parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, and Long represents District 27B, which covers parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties.
It will be up to the three Democratic Central Committees to nominate a replacement for Jackson and send that name to the governor.  They have 30 days after the seat comes open Wednesday to conduct interviews and nominate a replacement.
The Charles County committee has already scheduled a special Nov. 22 public hearing to discuss Jackson’s seat, while Calvert County’s next monthly meeting is set for Nov. 20 online, but it was not clear if the open Senate seat would be on the agenda. Prince George’s central committee usually meets on the third Tuesday of every month, but no meeting date has been posted online as of Tuesday.
According to an Oct. 21 letter from the Maryland Attorney General’s office, each central committee has one vote on the Senate nominee. “If two [central committees] select candidate A and one selects candidate B, the name of candidate A is sent to the Governor,” the letter said, but if each settle on a different candidate, all three names go to the governor, who makes the choice.
Jackson declined to say Tuesday who he supports as his successor, but said he will announce it soon.
“I’m not just going to let that go because they’re representing me, my family and my grandkids,” he said. “I’m hoping that these guys can come to some sort of consensus and figure out who’s going to be the one.”
If Long and Harris remain the only two candidates, Jackson said he’d let the central committees know his choice.
“I’ll say, ‘Hey, I’m leaning toward this one versus the other. I love both of them. They’re both great for the district. I just think right now, it’s better to have this particular one,’” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sen.-Michael-Jackson-10-21-2025-cropped-e1762907420700-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 02:58:13.614676

Following hours-long meetings of both the House Democratic and Senate Republican caucuses Tuesday evening, reports emerged from multiple sources of a tentative agreement to a $50.1 billion budget, with some details still to be ironed out.
The final price tag is roughly $1.4 billion less than what Gov. Josh Shapiro asked for in his February budget address, and just shy of the $50.3 billion proposal House Democrats passed last month in an attempt to move closer to Republican demands.
Republicans have been firm that they want a budget that will not eat into the state’s $7 billion rainy day fund, while Democrats pushed to increase spending, primarily on education.
Late Tuesday night, the Republican-controlled Senate also convened to advance a handful of code bills directing spending related to education, human services and capital projects. There was no discussion of the contents.

Both the House and Senate are scheduled to meet Wednesday morning.
The movement on the budget came after a long impasse, which appears to have been broken, at least for the moment, in recent discussions between Gov. Josh Shapiro, and top legislative leaders – Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia).
Even a hint that the budget impasse may finally be resolved was welcome news for Pennsylvania counties, school districts and social service providers.
Many that rely on state funding have had to dip into savings or cut spending to make it through the impasse. 
For some organizations that are contracted to provide human service programs funded by the state, it’s meant accepting low-interest loans from state Treasurer Stacy Garrity’s office. It was part of an effort her office established to help social service providers like rape crisis centers and domestic violence survivor support programs continue operating through the deadlock. 
Still, the 4.5% interest on the loans was too much for some service providers. The Senate, however, has passed a bill that would allow the Treasury to forgive the interest on the loans, though the House has yet to act on it.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-rotunda--1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)They may not be in uniform anymore, but the group of veterans that gathered Tuesday at the War Memorial Plaza in Baltimore said they still felt called to serve.
The veterans gathered to rally about President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to send federal troops into the city. They said veterans must again defend democracy, but this time in their own cities.
“Every major step towards justice in this country – freedom, opportunity, equality – was carried forward by men and women who served,” said Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran, local business owner and social media figure. “Now once again, it’s veterans who must stand and defend this nation, not from enemies abroad, but from racism and fascism and corporate corruptions that is growing here at home.
Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran and a Baltimore social media figure, said veterans must fight against the use of federal troops in American cities. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“When we raised our right hands and took an oath, it wasn’t to a politician, it wasn’t to a party, it was to the Constitution of the United States,” he said. “That oath did not expire when we took off our uniforms.”
LaPin was one of 10 veterans at the Baltimore demonstration, which was part of a nationwide demonstration called “Vets Say No,” organized by About Face Veterans, a veteran-led anti-war advocacy group.
“It’s a day to send a message,” said Clifford “Buzz” Grambo, a retired chief petty officer of the Navy, at the rally. “We can say it any day, but it’s Veteran’s Day. So obviously it carries a little bit more weight. Hopefully a lot of the civilian world will see it and start speaking out more.”
The “Vets Say No” demonstrations were organized in cities that already have federal troop presence and in cities, like Baltimore, where Trump has threatened to send troops. The administration has already deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
As with other cities where he has deployed, or threatened to deploy, troops,  Trump said he was doing so in response to surging crime in the cities he called crime “hellholes.” Local officials said that not only does Trump not have the authority to order Guard troops into cities, they are not the way to deal with crime and are not welcome.
In Baltimore, both Mayor Brandon Scott and Gov. Wes Moore said there is still work to be done to fight crime, but that rates of gun violence and homicides have fallen sharply. Federal help is welcome, they said, but not a military presence. That was echoed by vets at Tuesday’s rally.
Tim Eppers said a military “occupation” of Baltimore by National Guard troops would not solve the city’s problems. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“The National Guard has an honorable mission – disaster relief, rescue, rebuilding. That service, that protection, that’s what soldiers should do,” said Tim Eppers, a former Army sergeant. “But when they’re deployed in cities like ours, it turns our protectors into enforcers and citizens into suspects.”
Eppers said sending soldiers into Baltimore does not solve problems that the city faces, and resources should instead go into schools and education, mental health services and other programs that support communities.
“The idea of sending a National Guard in cities like Baltimore is wrong. It’s the wrong message, the wrong method and the wrong kind of mission,” Eppers said. “You can’t deploy your way to peace.”
“Every time we send soldiers into our own neighborhoods,” he said, “we’re sending a message, and that message says ‘we don’t trust you. We’ll control you before we’ll take care of you.’ That message destroys the very trust that keeps our communities safe. Baltimore doesn’t need an occupation, it needs opportunity.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_nov11_veteransdays_vetssayno3_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah and six other states along the Colorado River blew past their deadline Tuesday to reach a new deal on managing the dwindling river, but negotiations aren’t over. 
“We will continue to engage with our partners across the Basin to develop a framework that protects water users and the system as a whole,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Tuesday afternoon on the social media site X. 
The river contributes 27% of Utah’s water supply, and provides water to 40 million people across the U.S. and Mexico. Drought, overuse and hotter temperatures tied to climate change have all combined to shrink its flow. 
The federal government had said it would step in and make its own plan if states failed to reach broad consensus by Tuesday, but the states agree they don’t want that to happen, Cox said.
5 things to know as the clock runs down on Colorado River talks 

“While the Basin States did not finalize an agreement today on post-2026 Colorado River operations, our commitment to a state-led path remains,” the governor said. 
The U.S. Department of the Interior did not respond to questions from Utah News Dispatch Tuesday evening about the timeline and whether it would intervene. The current agreement runs through late 2026. 
The federal agency and Utah’s negotiator Gene Shawcroft issued the same prepared statement, saying the talks yielded “collective progress.” They did not give any details on sticking points. 
The seven states, the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water in the West, all “recognize the serious and ongoing challenges facing the Colorado River,” their statement says. “Prolonged drought and low reservoir conditions have placed extraordinary pressure on this critical water resource that supports 40 million people, tribal nations, agriculture, and industry.” 
They said the states and federal agencies share a commitment to ensuring the river’s long-term sustainability. 
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” the statement says.

The four Upper Basin states — Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California presented competing plans to the federal government last year. 
The Upper Basin states have sought to fend off mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they generally use much less than they’re allocated. The Lower Basin states have insisted that all seven absorb cuts in dry years. 
In part to prepare for the possibility of mandatory cuts, Utah has been investing in measuring and monitoring water use in recent years. 
In 2023, the Legislature set aside $1 million for a Colorado River measurement infrastructure project and $650,000 in ongoing yearly funding, according to the Utah Division of Water Rights.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)It’s been more than seven years since Utah last elected a Democrat to Congress. Republicans have overwhelmingly swept all four of the state’s U.S. House seats ever since former Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, narrowly lost his re-election bid in 2020. 
But Tuesday, the morning after a Utah judge again ruled in favor of anti-gerrymandering advocates who have spent years suing the Utah Legislature over redistricting, those groups celebrated what they called a victory in a drawn out battle for fairness in a state where Republicans have long kept a strong grip on state and federal representation. 
Utah judge faces impeachment threats after ordering congressional map with 1 Democratic seat

To the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — which include the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and a handful of Salt Lake County voters — Monday night’s court ruling wasn’t about Democrats versus Republicans, but rather fair representation. 
“There will be many who will try to frame this victory through the lens of partisanship. Some will co-opt this as a win for their party, and others will see it as a loss,” said Emma Petty-Addams, co-executive director of the nonpartisan group Mormon Women for Ethical Government. 
However, she said the court case has always been about standing firmly against gerrymandering “no matter which party initiatives or benefits from it.” 
She said it’s always been about restoring Proposition 4 — a ballot initiative Utah voters narrowly approved in 2018 to create an independent redistricting process with neutral map-drawing requirements. 
In 2021, the Utah Legislature undid that initiative and turned the commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. But the courts ruled lawmakers acted unconstitutionally when they repealed and replaced it, and they’ve since restored Proposition 4 as law.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
“Today, the people of Utah are getting what they voted for seven years ago. A fair map,” Petty-Addams said during a news conference Tuesday morning. “Utah is a special place. At a time when politicians are rushing to gerrymander their states for political advantage all over the country, a cross-partisan group of Utah citizens — Republicans, Democrats, independents — are finally seeing the fruits of their persistence and years-long commitment to do the opposite.” 
Still, the new court-ordered map will have major implications for the two-party dynamics in Republican-dominated Utah. 
Next year — if 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling holds — Democrats will have a strong chance of winning the 1st Congressional District under the map the judge ordered to be used for the 2026 elections. Gibson sided with the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit and rejected the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature’s preferred map, which would have created four Republican-leaning districts. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The Legislature’s preferred map, known as map C, would have been more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 congressional map that Gibson voided in August as the result of an unconstitutional process — but Republicans would have likely still dominated all four seats. 
Under the court-approved map, known as the plaintiffs’ Map 1, District 1 is concentrated around the state’s urban core. 
A recent map analysis by the Better Utah Institute —  a nonpartisan nonprofit that is related to the progressive advocacy group Alliance for a Better Utah — said the plaintiffs’ Map 1 would create one safe Democratic district and three safe Republican ones, with District 1 estimated to be 42.7% Republican and 52.7% Democratic, with a 10-point margin in favor of Democrats. 
Utah’s Republican legislators have long favored a “slice of the pie” approach to redistricting, or mixing urban and rural voices into all four congressional districts. But the judge rejected the Legislature’s preferred map and instead chose the plaintiffs’ Map 1, writing in her ruling that redistricting expert evidence and testimony showed the Legislature’s map was an “extreme partisan outlier” that exhibited “pro-Republican bias.” 
Republicans argue the plaintiffs’ map was gerrymandered to favor Democrats — but the plaintiffs’ attorney, David Reymann, said expert evidence showed that a map of its nature is “the natural result of Utah’s political geography, where you have a large proportion of the minority party concentrated in a single place.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
“That is not a partisan gerrymander,” he said. “A partisan gerrymander is taking a state’s political geography and manipulating it so you don’t have the natural result.” 
Reymann said Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature has long preferred mixing urban and rural voices in their redistricting maps as cover for “cracking” Salt Lake County, where most of the state’s Democrats are concentrated. 
“The urban-rural mix was always a canard that the Legislature spread that had no textual support of Prop 4,” he said. “The voters didn’t say we want a mix of urban and rural. That was always just a justification to crack Salt Lake County.” 
Utah’s Republican legislative leaders are likely to continue fighting Gibson’s order in court — and some GOP legislators have threatened to try and impeach Gibson — but barring a successful appeal, the plaintiffs’ Map 1 is the most likely to govern congressional boundaries for the 2026 election. 
Candidates can begin filing their bids in January. Already, some potential Democratic congressional hopefuls are lining up. 
McAdams, a former Salt Lake County mayor and Utah’s last Democratic congressman, recently invited his supporters to a formal campaign launch party scheduled for Thursday, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. 
Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, has also said she’s exploring a congressional bid.
Though it’s likely they’ll both want to run for the 1st Congressional District, it’s not yet clear what district they’d file to run in. In bids for the U.S. House, candidates aren’t required to live in the district where they run for office.

(Photo courtesy of USDA)Delayed food assistance benefits will be loaded onto payment cards overnight, South Dakota officials said Tuesday, but recipients will receive only a portion of their usual benefits.
The state Department of Social Services said it hopes to load the rest of the money onto payment cards later, after the federal government shutdown ends.
The state department said it followed Saturday guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, which directed states to issue 65% of benefits. But the state department said that because recipients’ benefits are calculated by household based on federal rules, “amounts received by beneficiaries will vary.”
US Supreme Court maintains temporary freeze on full SNAP benefits for November

South Dakota typically distributes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments on the 10th day of the month, which was Monday. The benefits were delayed because of federal shutdown-related chaos affecting the program that helps 42 million Americans, including 75,000 South Dakotans, afford groceries. It takes about $15 million of federal funding monthly to cover benefits in South Dakota.
On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the program’s full November benefits, despite the ongoing government shutdown, which was caused by Congress’ failure to pass a spending bill on time.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states it was releasing full November funding for SNAP, and the South Dakota Department of Social Services said it would pay full benefits Monday.
Later Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed. The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday by saying it had “paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits.”
Monday night, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that could end the government shutdown, but the bill still needs approval from the House and a signature from President Trump, which is expected later this week.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court extended through Thursday its pause on the lower court order that had directed the Trump administration to pay full November benefits.

Gary Stubblefield of Branch during a town hall in Charleston discussing the proposed Franklin County prison on Nov. 7, 2024. (Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Members of Ozark’s city council unanimously voted on Monday against starting discussions with the state to potentially supply water for a planned 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County.
City Councilor Randy Melton told the Advocate Tuesday that the vote didn’t mean they wouldn’t talk to state officials at all — merely that those working on the prison would have to be the ones to initiate those talks.
The council approved a resolution earlier this year opposing the prison project, which blindsided and angered local officials and residents when it was announced in 2024. Opponents to building the prison in Franklin County have criticized Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, her staff and the Arkansas Department of Corrections for not consulting with the local community prior to purchasing an 815-acre property near Charleston for the prison last year.
Those opponents have argued nearly from the start that the site was unsuitable due to the lack of an available workforce and uncertainties about whether local infrastructure could support a large prison. State officials who participated in the search have disputed these claims.
Sanders said as recently as last week, however, that the Franklin County site remains “the best location in the state.” In remarks minutes after filing for reelection, she said “everybody wants to fight over the location, but the real question, the real fight should be, how do we do a better job protecting our state?”
How to supply the prison site with drinking water — or whether it was possible to supply water in the first place — has been an open question in recent months. Groundwater well testing at the property produced far less water than what would be needed for the facility, the Advocate found earlier this year, and the city of Fort Smith said its water system did not have the capacity to serve the prison.
Well testing documents for Franklin County prison contradict prison contractor

Ozark said in its previous resolution that the city didn’t have the capacity to provide water to the prison either.
“We decided last night that if the state is really serious about contacting us, that we need to hear from somebody in an official capacity, either from the governor’s office or from the prison board, or somebody, besides just hearsay,” Melton said Tuesday.
The matter was on the Monday’s council agenda because Ozark Mayor Roxie Hall had been told the state required a letter from her asking to start discussions before they would talk to the city, but Melton said he still didn’t know who told her that.
“My question was, you know, who was it [the call] from? Was it an actual official or whatever that wants us to basically say that we’re willing to talk with them?” Melton said. “We never did find out anything about it. …. There was no names mentioned or anything. So basically, to me, it’s just hearsay.”
Hall did not return a voicemail from the Advocate left at Ozark City Hall Tuesday afternoon.
Melton agrees with residents from nearby Charleston that the prison site selection was handled poorly. However, Ozark’s looming water infrastructure needs meant the city council couldn’t simply ignore the state if it comes knocking with offers, he said.

Just maintaining the city’s current level of service will require $22.9 million, he said — with total needs projected upwards of $90 million.
The city has been working to figure out how to fund the needed infrastructure through either the local sales tax or increases to water bills, but even small increases could be hard on Ozark residents and those who rely on its water system, Melton said.
“We are a very poor community,” he said. “That’s why I feel we have to at least see what [the state] has got to offer. We can’t say no without any conversation.”
But Melton stressed that if the state did initiate discussions, it doesn’t mean Ozark would agree to allow the prison to draw from its water system.
Prior to the city council meeting on Monday, Republican Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest said during a press conference at the state Capitol in Little Rock that state officials were attempting to “try and bribe” Ozark into using their water system.
“Extortion is happening behind the scenes, as Sen. [Gary] Stubblefield said, to try and bribe them with your tax dollars,” King said.
Stubblefield represented the area where the planned prison will be built and was one of the prison project’s most outspoken opponents. He died in September just weeks after accusing prison proponents within state government of extorting lawmakers who voted against a $750 million appropriation to fund the prison’s construction by threatening to withhold state funds and grants from their districts.
The appropriation bill failed in the Senate five times earlier this year after it failed to get three-fourths of the chamber to vote for it.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20241107_Grajeda_Gary-Stubblefield-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 19:57:31.429617

All six of the veterans who were honored lost their lives in combat. The ceremony at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance was a continuation of the state’s Fallen Heroes Bridge Dedication program. It was launched in 2019 by then-Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration to dedicate bridges to South Dakotans who were killed in action or classified as missing in action.
Gov. Larry Rhoden attended Tuesday’s ceremony.
“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” Rhoden said, quoting former President Ronald Reagan. “We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on for them to do the same.”
The program has a committee that meets annually in April and selects veterans to honor and bridges to dedicate. An application form is available online.
The state’s Department of Veterans Affairs said more than 50 bridges had been named in honor of South Dakota veterans before Tuesday’s ceremony. The department said more than 3,000 South Dakotans have died while serving in the military. 



Bridge dedications
The South Dakota veterans honored on Tuesday:

Navy Water Tender Second Class Porter Rich: Served on several battleships and was killed aboard the USS Oklahoma during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, the same year he was married and his son was born. The Porter L. Rich Bridge is on U.S. Highway 14, about 2 miles east of De Smet.
Navy Machinist’s Mate Second Class Milton Muller: Served on the USS Leary and died when the ship was torpedoed in the North Atlantic on Christmas 1943; his body was never recovered. The Milton L. Muller Bridge is on state Highway 38 bridge, east of Montrose.

Between now and Thanksgiving Day, our goal is to inspire 1,200 members to chip in and help feed Vermont neighbors in need, while keeping fact-checked local news free for everyone. Will you join us?

Donate and send 3 meals

Every gift this season does double duty: it sustains VTDigger’s nonprofit newsroom and sends three meals to a neighbor through the Vermont Foodbank, thanks to support from our partnership sponsor, The Richards Group.
VTDigger has partnered with the Foodbank every year since food insecurity began rising sharply in 2020. The organization now distributes 25% more food each year than it did before the pandemic. 
But this year, the need is greater still.
In addition to the expected increase in food assistance needs as the temperature drops and utility bills creep up, changes in federal nutrition funding and the ongoing government shutdown have created uncertainty and put new strain on Vermont’s food assistance network. And some 14,000 Vermonters could lose food benefits in 2026 when new federal rules take effect.
At VTDigger, our reporters track policy shifts at the state and national level and their local impacts on real people so Vermonters can stay informed.
When you give, you help us report the facts with care and depth, and today, you’ll also put meals on Vermont tables.

While protesters chanted against the conservative ideals of Turning Point USA, event attendees laughed and danced inside the hall of one of the most liberal universities in the nation.


A few hundred feet apart, yet worlds away politically, furious students at UC Berkeley protested the final stop of the conservative organization Turning Point USA’s “American Comeback Tour,” hosted Monday night on what is known as the nation’s most liberal campus. 
The event drew many older attendees who at various moments danced to “YMCA,” laughed, and held moments of silence for the late TPUSA leader Charlie Kirk. 
Outside the event, students, most of them far younger than the attendees inside, faced off with police in riot gear, with physical fights prompting arrests. One man was taken to a hospital after being struck in the head.
On Tuesday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division would investigate the event. Attorney General Pam Bondi also tweeted that the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force would be launching a full investigation of what she called “violent riots at UC Berkeley.”
In a statement, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said the university is conducting a “full investigation” and “intends to fully cooperate” with the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify “the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event.” 
During the event, a large police presence held back protesters several hundred feet away and held up batons and projectile weapons. The UC Police Department, private security, and law enforcement from Alameda County and San Francisco were staged at Lower Sproul, a plaza in front of Zellerbach. The event was strictly monitored, with bags, food, beverages, signs and flags prohibited. 
Law enforcement had already begun in the early morning, with the UC Police Department arresting four students at midnight for felony vandalism for trying to attach a giant cardboard bug to Sather Gate at the campus entrance as a protest against the TPUSA event, as reported by the Daily Californian. 
The event occurred exactly two months to the day after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the founder of TPUSA, who was shot on a Utah university campus while he debated students about his political viewpoints. 
Two student reporters for CalMatters were at the event. Here’s what they saw both outside and in.

Outside, 4:30 p.m.
Protests were just beginning in Sproul Plaza, a central area on campus, while Lower Sproul Plaza, the area in front of Zellerbach Hall, was entirely barricaded by law enforcement. Surrounding campus buildings had closed as early at 12:45 p.m., causing student group meetings to be cancelled or moved to Zoom. 
Unable to walk straight to Zellerbach Hall, the hundreds of protesters moved down Bancroft Way toward the campus’s Student Union, where event attendees lined up to enter the barricaded space in front of Zellerbach. A fight broke out between two men, one of whom was selling “Freedom” shirts. Their altercation and subsequent arrest briefly shut down the street. 
Inside, 5:30 p.m.
Inside the event, attendees, most of whom were not students, filed in wearing red MAGA hats and “Freedom” shirts. As they took their seats, they danced to “Born in the USA,” “YMCA” and “Here Comes the Sun.” 
Outside, 5:30 p.m. 
A panic briefly ran through the crowd when a car on Bancroft Way began to backfire, mimicking the sound of gunshots, causing some attendees to duck and run as smoke filled the air. No one was injured, and the majority of protesters continued to chant and bang on the barricades in front of almost 20 UCPD officers holding up their batons. 
Inside, 6:30 p.m.
Jobob Taeleifi, a comedian and friend of Kirk’s, kicked off the event, followed by John Paul Leon, UC Berkeley’s Turning Point USA chapter president, who announced the entrance of Christian apologist and Kirk mentor Frank Turek. 
“When a bullet soared through the air, an assassin took the life of a courageous man,” Leon told the crowd. “The sad truth is, the left are not your friends. They will mock and dehumanize you just so they can laugh at your corpse … To all those protesters outside, I have one thing to say: It is clear to us which side is winning when your side becomes the violent agitators.”
Taeleifi, Leon and Turek all focused much of their speeches on criticizing the protests outside. Turek called Kirk a “martyr” and recounted his experience watching Kirk die. 
“I’m never going to forget Charlie’s lifeless eyes looking back right past me,” Turek said. 
Comedian Rob Schneider, who spoke after Turek, thanked “antifa” for their “welcome.” Schneider spoke about his experience at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event, did impressions of God and said, “God said Trump’s my guy.”
“There is an attack on Western civilization and the United States is the last bastion of hope,” Schneider said. “As Charlie Kirk said, if you do not assimilate, it is an invasion, and that is what we’re experiencing.” 
Outside, 6:30 p.m.
Two people who were arguing began to fight. One was detained by the police.
The protest mostly congregated around one barricaded entrance to the event. Some were there in response to calls put out by UC Berkeley student activist groups like Students Organizing for Liberation, Young Democratic Socialists of America and Jewish Voice for Peace. In addition to the large number of students, protesters also included people who did not attend UC Berkeley – groups like SF Bay Activists held a “dance party” protest. 
Away from the epicenter of the shouts and chants in front of police, many hung back just to watch and observe. 
One student protester, Asha Genett, said she attended because she disagreed with Turning Point’s support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, which she called “human rights abuses.” 
“I think that conversation between conservatives and liberals or leftists is important,” Genett said. “I don’t think the way that TPUSA strives to engage in that is productive or helpful. I think it’s inflammatory.”
Chants varied between condemnations of TPUSA’s conservative ideals, to calls for them to leave campus. Protesters shouted, “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F— Charlie Kirk.” 
Protester Court Freund, a UC Berkeley master’s student who identifies as a Democrat and libertarian, said he disagreed with TPUSA on everything but free speech.
“My perspective is that TPUSA and other organizations I strongly disagree with, as long as they’re not espousing direct harm to someone on campus, they should be here and have a right to be here,” he said. 
“By closing them out from our campus, which is supposed to be a hub for intellectual debate, so many progressives just want to shut out the other side,” Freund said. “By doing that, they automatically lose a large percentage of people.”
According to Mogulof, a 45-year-old male attendee of the TPUSA event was struck in the head with a glass bottle, and was transported to a nearby hospital for a laceration to his head. 
Inside, 8:10 p.m.
A line of attendees filled the entirety of the aisle waiting for their chance to ask a question as Schneider hosted a Q&A with Turek, author Andrew Doyle and philosopher Peter Boghossian to conclude the event.
Jackie Jones, a student and comedy club co-president, asked Schneider if there are things comedians shouldn’t joke about, to which Schneider replied that it is a comedian’s job to “challenge” people and push boundaries. He also praised Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, calling him a “genius.”
Outside, 8:45 p.m.
Protesters circled Lower Sproul to block exits, facing off with police behind barricades as attendees left the event. Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments. The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof. 
“These people can’t be negotiated with,” said student and event attendee Matthew Edgar of the protesters outside. “They would celebrate if I died. It’s nonsensical. I’m going to walk out of here, and I’ll probably have virtually no friends coming out of Berkeley.”

“We knew going into this, this was going to open up a can of worms,” task force co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said Monday. ”But we had so many compelling stories that were coming forward that, you can’t ignore it, and there does need to be oversight.”

The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met for what’s likely the second-to-last time on Monday at the Capitol to discuss main takeaways from the five meetings it held across the state starting in July. The task force cannot pass legislation but may provide recommendations to their fellow lawmakers. 
The members hope to meet once more to make final recommendations regarding some of the topics, including additional training for those involved in the system, better recognition of patterns of abuse and violence, avoiding lengthy delays in processes that are supposed to be temporary, and more effective use of local law enforcement to uphold court orders.
The document of primary topics was generated using AI from transcripts of the prior meetings, members said Monday. 
 Additional training on domestic violence and abuse

Legislators discussed adding bans on “coercive control,” which is a pattern of behavior that abusers may use to manipulate or trap their partners, to Idaho’s domestic violence laws. 
“I think that would be an easy thing to put in, and I think it would help give some clarification,” task force co-Chair Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, said.

She also said she’d like to see more training for judges on manipulation in domestic violence situations. 
Task force members also considered ensuring that in-person mediation sessions in custody conflicts aren’t required in cases of documented abuse. 
“Maybe we bring in the digital stuff into that, where you don’t have to be in mediation with your abuser if there is documented abuse,” Scott suggested. 
Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, noted that other states have passed legislation modeled after a federal law known as Kayden’s Law, which includes requirements that judges consider child safety in custody decisions and mandates training for judges to better recognize domestic violence. 
Legislators in Utah passed a version of the law in 2024, after 16-year Om Gandhi was killed by his father during a court-mandated visit in Salt Lake City amid a contentious custody dispute, Utah News Dispatch reported. 
 Easing financial imbalances between parents

To address financial imbalances, task force members suggested implementing a process for a parent in a child custody dispute who has far fewer resources to ask the court to require the parent with more money to pay attorney fees for both parties. 
Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, said he’d prepared draft legislation to create the process. Gannon is a civil attorney.

“I think this could help to prevent using the legal system to bully the other, weaker party,” Gannon said. “And I think that there could be some real good results, because the party with resources would have some incentive to maybe minimize the litigation, and both parties would come together and be more likely to resolve the dispute.” 
In cases to terminate parental rights of one parent, the state removed the right to public defense in 2025 legislation.
Bjerke described Gannon’s proposal as a “great place to start” to help improve fairness to some of these cases. 
“Having the ability to look at exactly what is being expended for each party and trying to make it as equal as possible, it shouldn’t be that one person wins a case because their resources are greater,” Bjerke said. 
 Time restraints on temporary orders

Legislators spoke at length Monday about how to constrain temporary custody or visitation orders, which are meant to be short-term court directives allowing one parent to assume temporary custody prior to a full custody hearing. The orders are meant to be used in situations of abuse or neglect. 
Lawmakers said use of the orders are being drawn out, sometimes for months or years.

“I feel like we have legalized kidnapping,” Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, said. “… One of the most sacred rights, that we don’t give, that a parent has, because that comes from the Lord, is their ability to have and raise their children. And then when we legally take that right away, when there’s nothing criminal that can be pointed to, I believe that is certainly a disservice by the justices, certainly disservice by legislative branch, and I would say the executive branch also. I would hope that this committee will work to remedy this particular part.” 
Lawmakers considered implementing a 30-day limit on temporary orders in which there’s no criminal allegations. 
Gannon, however, said 30 days seemed too short in some cases. 
Bjerke said that the extended time on temporary orders is likely driven by delays and backlogs in the court system. 
“If we want to provide something more like a 30-day temporary order, how much more of the system do we create to accomplish that?” Bjerke asked “… None of us want to grow government and to further fund things, but at the same time, we’re not going to be able to take care of this stuff, or a lot of it, without some enhancements made to our current judicial system.”
 Better use of law enforcement for custody orders

Some task force members also hope to utilize police more to enforce custody orders. It is a criminal offense to violate a court order regarding custody, such as keeping the child too long, but lawmakers said Monday they are hearing law enforcement officers are hesitant to step into what seems more like a civil matter. 
Officers often refer parents back to civil court for enforcement, legislators said. 
Scott asked members if the Legislature should clarify that law enforcement has authority to enforce family law.

Bjerke argued that may put officers in the middle of contentious custody disputes. 
“We just don’t have the bandwidth in our current law enforcement system to do this,” he said. 
Ehardt disagreed, and said that law enforcement handles “domestic problems” daily. 
Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said that the Legislature may need to implement some type of database so police could access the most up-to-date custody orders if called to enforce a violation. 
Task force members have not yet set a meeting date to share proposed legislation. 
Members said that, because the area of family law is complicated, often involving emotional or high-conflict cases, there may be a multi-year effort to make changes. 
Rep. Marco Erickson, R-Idaho Falls, suggested the group put together an assessment of gaps and a five-year plan. 
“There’s still going to be some low-hanging fruit that we could potentially do right away, but this is not a next-session process,” Erickson said. “Obviously, we know this could be up to five years, but if we were to develop something like that, a process in a five year plan, we can start to fill those gaps, put in the pieces of legislation, have the proper conversations with our community partners and the people that would be implementing this on the ground, so that way we’re not causing this massive chaos in the lawyers or in the courts.”

""Our feeling is that, if we force this level and degree of change on our districts and our (supervisory unions), it simply won't work,"" task force member and former superintendent Jay Badams said.

The majority of Vermont school redistricting task force members endorsed a proposal on Monday that would incentivize voluntary mergers of the state’s 119 school districts. Most of the committee also opposed a new school district map based around centers for career and technical education.
The nearly 170-page proposal approved by the body is a more detailed plan than the rejected career and technical education map, developed by Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and Dave Wolk, Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the task force. That plan adhered more closely to the guidelines around Act 73 — that is, to draw a map of borders for new school districts.
But the approved proposal, in a way, flouts Act 73’s directive that the task force deliver at least one and no more than three new maps by Dec. 1 for the Vermont Legislature to consider in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January. Members of the task force who supported the proposal said it was the only responsible way forward, and argued that plans to reform the public education system would not work if school districts were forced to merge.
“We’re speculating in thinking that large scale district consolidation is going to somehow save money,” said Jay Badams, a task force member and former superintendent. “The research that we’ve consulted indicates, at best, that it might and it might not. To put the system through that much radical change for the possibility that there might be savings sure seems like a lot to ask of our communities.”
The proposal, developed by task force members Badams; Jennifer Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District; and Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, lays out a 10-year plan where districts would be incentivized to merge to access state construction aid, and to coordinate on developing regional high schools.
The proposal is a synthesis of two previous plans, one that centered redistricting around regional high schools, and another that emphasized using regional BOCES, or a board of cooperative educational services, which are used in other rural states to help school districts collaborate on services.
Five regional cooperative service agencies would be layered over the state’s existing 119 school districts and 52 supervisory districts and supervisory unions to help those entities share services like transportation and special education.

Slide via School Redistricting Task Force
“The key to this is voluntary participation,” Badams said. “Our feeling is that if we force this level and degree of change on our districts and our (supervisory unions), it simply won’t work.”
Wolk questioned whether their proposal meets the directives set out by Act 73.
“What’s been presented is some kind of voluntary collaboration, which I’m sure could and would and should happen,” he said. “But is it a map as directed to us by the Legislature?”
Holcombe replied that the “responsible thing is to say, that’s actually not responsible, but here’s some other things you could do instead.”

Deep disagreements
The votes taken on Monday, and the discussion around the two proposals, highlight deep disagreements among policymakers around the intent of Act 73 and foreshadow a difficult Legislative session to come. 
Task force members throughout their seven meetings thus far have pointed to the lack of time to thoroughly develop plans for the kind of systemwide transformation that Act 73 envisions.
“If I had to give my advice to the Legislature, it would be, ‘It’s not ready,’” Badams said on Monday. “If we gave them a map just to give them a map, we just wasted a lot of our own time doing this stuff.”
He continued, “I think that’s the recommendation: Here’s the best we could do, this gets us started and lets us start making some headway.”
But Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders did not appear to support that approach. 
During a presentation to the task force on Monday, Saunders said their plan for voluntary mergers did not align with the intent of Act 73 “because it does not recommend a specific map that would satisfy the parameters of your charge as the redistricting task force.”
Also, she said adding regional service areas on top of the education system’s existing structure would create “an additional layer of bureaucracy and also cost.”
“Given that we have challenges hiring for the critical roles we have now within our system, and then maintaining the central office, and on top of that building in another layer of a BOCES, I think it does create some additional complexity for the system,” she said.
Task force members pushed back against this, and pointed to research from other rural states that show the mechanism would help the state save money.
Rep. Edye Graning, D-Jericho, the co-chair of the task force, said she was “incredibly distraught when the secretary came in and said misinformation about having our cooperative service agencies being an extra layer of bureaucracy.”
“That’s not what they are, and that’s not what they do, and I don’t want that to derail the process,” Graning said.

‘Hard to stomach’
Wolk and Beck’s proposal was the first proposal to be floated, at the task force’s halfway mark. 
The map — now discontinued, at least as far as the task force is concerned — used career and technical education regions as an organizing principle. 
That plan would create seven supervisory districts, concentrated in the northwest and southeast regions of the state, and seven supervisory unions with 21 school districts contained within them in southern Vermont and in the Northeast Kingdom.
The proposal would increase access to career and technical education opportunities, while “respecting historical patterns” in school choice, Beck said on Monday.
“The map is not perfect,” Wolk said. “I doubt any map that we came up with, given the timeline, would be perfect. The Legislature, understandably, will have their way, as they should.”


In her presentation, Saunders said theirs was the “only proposal that aligns with the intent of Act 73.”
But members of the task force raised a number of concerns, specifically around the size of the map’s proposed district in Chittenden County. Nearly 22,000 students would be consolidated into a single district there under the plan.
Several members questioned why much of the state was being asked to merge into single supervisory districts, while other areas retained the supervisory union structure.
“I’m trying to figure out the logic behind why some regions should do mass mergers, and some regions are going to be asked to do absolutely nothing, really,” Holcombe said.
Other members further criticized the proposal, arguing it preserved school choice in areas with prominent private schools, called independent schools in state law.
“I think the care taken to preserve tuitioning choice in some regions, and the lack of care taken in larger school districts … is really hard to stomach,” Graning said on Monday.
The majority of task force members voted against sending the proposal to the Legislature for consideration, with only Beck, Wolk and Rep. Beth Quimby, Caledonia-3, voting in favor.
Badams, in a strong rebuke, said he didn’t “want to hand the Legislature a map that gives that pathway after hearing what I heard today from the secretary.”
“If that ends up being used as the way to chop up the state and force the mergers,” he said, “I don’t want to personally vote to put that forward.”
With a final report due in December, the task force will meet for the last time on Nov. 20 to refine the report and its proposal before submitting it to the Legislature.

Only about 3,000 remain and about 85% of the American meatpacking industry is controlled by four companies: JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield. The other 20% of that market share is held in part by small and very small meat producers scattered across the country, including some in Montana.
About half of small and medium meat processors have disappeared in the last 20 years, and a decades long University of Illinois study found the average length of a meat processing business surviving was 9.7 years. Between inspections, startup costs and other factors, it’s not an easy business to get into or keep afloat. 
This is true for much of the agricultural industry, and many small businesses have disappeared as corporate America has exerted its will on farmers and ranchers. About 70% of the consumer’s dollar went to cattle producers in 1970, with the other 30% going to processors and retailers. Cattle producers now get about 30% of the consumer’s dollar, according to Farm Action.
Additionally, about 98% of America’s beef is processed in just over 50 plants. Beef processing co-ops have been created around the state in an effort to help give beef producers more options, but there’s another problem too — employees.
That’s the place some educators in Montana are looking to step in. Fergus High School in Lewistown, for example, has a robust agricultural education program. It’s also part of the Central Montana Career and Technology Education Academy, a public charter school that was set up this year to connect students with skills and knowledge needed to work in agriculture.
 ‘A dying art’

Logan Turner, one the teachers at Fergus High School, put it pointedly.
“Kids aren’t really getting into it,” he said. “Cutting meat is kind of a dying art.”
His goal has been, in part, to help change that trend. The technical academy seeks to bridge a gap of  agricultural knowledge. Beyond meat cutting, classes at the school include farm business management, fabrication and science classes geared toward teaching about soil health among others.
Turner grew up on his family’s farm outside Missoula and quickly decided he wanted to be a teacher. There’s an urgency for him too, with worries, among them a feeling no one knows where their food comes from and the world’s growing population. 
“We’ve always been faced with this big issue as agriculturalists,” Turner said. “2050 is right around the corner, and there’s going to be two billion more people on the face of the planet, and how are we going to feed them all? I think it all starts with education and understanding … and so I felt like being an educator probably was the best way for me to contribute.”
Only about three percent of the food Montanans eat is produced in the state. There are options for eating local food, but they can sometimes be hard to find. 
Having kids learn about these could also help them enter the workforce with more ideas about what they want to do, which is one of the goals of the program. Orin Johnson, the Central Montana CTE Academy director, said they also want to get students as close as possible to certification in a variety of careers.
“Every kid doesn’t learn the same way,” Johnson said. “And some really do strive and need to be hands on, and it’s about finding a way to create opportunities that they can be hands on.”
Students at the school have shown interest and it’s included partnerships with Future Farmers of America and the Montana Farmers Union, which gave the meat processing program two grants totaling about $13,000 over the summer.
“We do a lot of meat processing at my house because my dad loves hunting, and so we do a lot of wild game,” said Shyanne Ricks, a student at the school who’s gone through the program. “And so doing the meats class really helps with seeing the whole process, not just wild game.”
Ricks, along with Tori Rindal, a freshman at the school, and the other Lewistown agricultural education teacher — Jared Long — went to the Montana Farmers Union Annual convention and spoke about the program.
Rindal said she’s hoping to take the meats class next year. Long pointed out agricultural education is broad and students can take many different paths.
The program offers five pathways: welding, natural resource and conservation, meat processing, animal science and agricultural mechanics. There’s a variety of classes within those, both Long and Turner explained.
“The common misconception is that it’s just cows and plows,” Long said. “So that’s really our job, we feel like, is to open doors to kids that they might never have.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776

Jerry Moran of Kansas and members of the U.S. Marine Corps were aboard the USS Intrepid on Veterans Day for ringing of the Nasdaq Exchange’s opening bell.
Moran, the Republican chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said the ceremony was an opportunity to honor people such as his father, Raymond Edwin Moran, who served in the U.S. Army in North Africa and Italy during World War II.
“Across America, from the prairies of my home state of Kansas to the skyline of New York City, people are expressing their gratitude and respect for those who serve our country today and for those who served our country in the past,” the senator said.
Moran continued: “Our country needs role models, needs to see what those who put country above self — or above politics or above party — what difference they made, and we need to role model ourselves after them.”

At Fort Leavenworth, the Senate included $8 million to construction a new fire station to improve response times on the post.
Marshall said the U.S. Department of Defense bill, which was sent to the U.S. House, included $1.9 billion for construction, operation and maintenance of military family housing. It featured $1.3 billion for renovation, and construction of barracks and dorms, as well as $1.3 billion for projects to improve military hospitals, schools, child development centers and other facilities, he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jerry-Moran-veterans-day-ship.png,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776

The job is to save the democracy.’","Chris Murphy was known as a lead negotiator during the Biden administration, tackling thorny political issues like gun safety and immigration. But as a group of congressional Democrats struck a bipartisan deal to end the government shutdown, the Connecticut senator was notably not involved — and openly critical of the negotiations taking place.
In an interview from early 2024, as the Senate was taking a vote on an immigration bill he helped craft but that ultimately failed, Murphy said he was proud of “my developing role as a negotiator and dealmaker in the Senate.” But as the Senate took a series of votes to pass the shutdown deal on Monday night, the Connecticut senator was seeing things very differently. 
“I just don’t think that’s the job right now. The job is to save the democracy and that involves a lot more fighting and drawing hard lines than it does negotiating,” Murphy said in an interview near the Senate floor as lawmakers passed the government funding package Monday night. “I think there’s a danger to bipartisan dealmaking today in a world where it ends up giving some level of endorsement to [President Donald Trump’s] campaign to destroy our democracy.”
“There’s still room for negotiation, but only with Republicans that are willing to actually stand in the way of his corruption,” he added. “Unfortunately, there don’t seem to be any Republicans right now that are willing to protect our democracy and thus you don’t have negotiating partners.”
That’s a marked change from the past couple of years when Murphy seemed to revel in his role as a key negotiator for some of the more politically fraught issues coming before Congress.
In 2022, he secured one of the biggest policy achievements of his career with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which brought modest changes to gun laws after  pushing for reforms for a decade. Several months after, he was part of a negotiating group on the Electoral Count Act, aimed at preventing future interference in certifying election results and avoiding a repeat of the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol.
A year later, Murphy waded into a more unconventional policy area for him when he became the lead Democrat trying to hash out a border deal to unlock support for then-President Joe Biden’s national security package. The deal seemed like it would get the backing of nearly two dozen Senate Republicans, but most of that support quickly disappeared when Trump, who was a presidential candidate at the time, came out against the bipartisan legislation.
It was, as they say, a wake-up call for Murphy.
“In 2022, when we negotiated the gun bill, we didn’t have to deal with Trump. It mattered what he was going to say about it, but we didn’t have to negotiate with him,” he recalled. “Now you have to negotiate directly with him. By the time we got to 2024, he was starting to take control of the party. I saw the transition.”
Murphy doesn’t know how the Democratic side of the shutdown negotiating group came together, and shook his head when asked if he had been interested in getting involved. But he said he spoke with those colleagues over the past few weeks and discouraged them from making a deal that contained only a promise to vote on enhanced health care subsidies, rather than a guaranteed extension.
Murphy, who became a prominent voice on gun control following the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, has become even more of a national figure since last year’s election. He is frequently mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 2028 — or moving higher up the ranks of Senate leadership — and has grown into a prolific fundraiser. He has nearly $11 million in his campaign account, even though he will not need to tap into that for his own race since he’s not up for reelection until 2030.
But he has more recently focused on his political action committee, American Mobilization Project. His PAC has made political contributions to some of his colleagues and other Democratic candidates, but has also contributed money to efforts and groups pushing back against the Trump administration rather than tied to an election. Some of that money has gone to organizing groups like Georgia Youth Justice Coalition for Action, Project 26 Pennsylvania, and Down Home North Carolina.
His ascendance in the Democratic Party hasn’t come without sharp criticism from Republicans inside and outside of Washington.
Murphy has tangled with the White House over the past year and the president himself, who has posted on his preferred social media platform, Truth Social, to take jabs at the senator.
And Republicans back in his home state have also been critical of his more visible role in the Democratic Party. 
Connecticut Republican Party chairman Ben Proto argued Murphy’s evolving role in the party “gives him a huge platform, takes fundraising prowess to another level and gives him an opportunity to be even more hyper partisan, particularly if he’s in the minority.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, remembers his time serving in the state legislature while Murphy was a state senator. At a recent meeting speaking to Connecticut’s Young Republicans chapter, Candelora placed the blame for the shutdown on Democrats for digging in on their health care demands. And he singled out Murphy, painting his transformation as someone who has moved away from policy in pursuit of politics.
“Unfortunately because we live in such a blue state, our [congressional] delegation feels that they have the ability to do that without coming to the table. And I was around and worked with Sen. Murphy at the time,” Candelora said. “I watched the evolution of an individual who used to be principled and believe in policy to evolve into a political creature that has become the fundraising machine for the Democrat Party nationally, and it’s at the expense of the state of Connecticut.”
But Murphy’s frustration and criticism is not limited to Republicans. The three-term senator has become one of the most outspoken Democrats to take aim at his own party, especially when it comes to reassessing their messaging as a party after major losses in 2024 and their response to the Trump administration.
That frustration was especially evident this week. Murphy and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both opposed the bill that would reopen the government because it made no guarantee to extend the policy at the heart of the fight: expiring health care subsidies.
Blumenthal similarly wasn’t part of the shutdown negotiating group and warned  against accepting a deal that fell short on health care. Like Murphy, last week’s electoral victories bolstered his belief that Democrats should have stood firm on their demand that an extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies — that are set to expire at the end of the year — must be in a funding agreement.
Blumenthal, who’s been involved in his own bipartisan negotiations on legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and some of his foreign policy work, said he’s close with a few of the Democratic negotiators and had been talking to them in recent weeks throughout the shutdown.
“I didn’t discourage them from talking. I would never discourage an attempt to reach a bipartisan solution, but anything that failed to adequately address health care would be a nonstarter for the caucus, and was going to be heavily criticized,” Blumenthal said.
The latest rift over the shutdown deal put a spotlight back on the divisions within the Democratic Party that were brewing earlier this year. When government funding was close to running out last spring, Senate Democratic leadership faced blowback from the base for providing enough votes for Republicans to keep operations going through the fall.
Murphy said he worries that Democratic defections on major pieces of legislation ultimately gives Trump more leverage and power. Democrats split on a short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, twice this year.
On top of that, he pointed to Democratic votes for the Laken Riley Act, which requires U.S. officials to detain any immigrant without legal status who has been arrested, charged or convicted of specific crimes, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. Senate Democrats didn’t get a vote on an amendment to the latter bill, which sought to block elected officials like the president from personally profiting. Trump signed both bills into law earlier this year.
“I think it’s really harmful to have our party regularly split like this. This is the fourth major instance this year … where a minority of Democrats worked with Republicans to pass legislation that allows Trump to get away with a lot of corruption and illegality,” Murphy said. “At the very least, there should have been more people in that room, but we also have to find a way as a party to stop being split over and over again.”
Murphy has had a long political career that began at the age of 25 when he ran for the Connecticut House of Representatives. He went on to serve in both houses of the state legislature before he unseated a Republican congresswoman in 2006. He has served in Congress ever since, moving over to the U.S. Senate after the 2012 election.
Now, at the age of 52, he acknowledges the trajectory of his time in elected office and how he’s moved away from his dealmaking days from just a few years ago.
“I just think 2025 is fundamentally different than any other year that I’ve been involved in politics,” Murphy said. “I think I would be committing sort of political malpractice if I was operating this year like I’ve operated in the past.”
Responding to criticisms from Republicans who’ve known him for years, Murphy said he’s proud of his work with GOP lawmakers during his time in Connecticut’s General Assembly and on Capitol Hill. Yet, he’s unsure of more dealmaking in the near future.
“I wish that there were more opportunities for good bipartisanship,” he said. “But right now, those avenues aren’t available.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25302675892581-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A security company has dropped its lawsuit over Washington’s new sales tax on services weeks after filing it.
It’s unclear why. 
The development came after Security Services Northwest brought a suit against the state at the end of September. The voluntary dismissal, signed by a Thurston County Superior Court judge Nov. 4, was without prejudice, meaning the company could refile its lawsuit.
The Sequim-based firm and its lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. The state’s Department of Revenue and attorney general’s office weren’t sure why the company backed down. 
Security Services Northwest’s lawsuit centered on Senate Bill 5814, a contentious measure Democratic lawmakers passed this year to bring in $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and over $2.6 billion over four years. The law was part of a suite of new and increased taxes and fees Democrats pushed through to fill a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
It took effect Oct. 1.
The law expanded taxes on a number of services, including security services. Others covered by the tax law include live presentations, information technology and temporary staffing. Over 90,000 companies are expected to pay under the law.
The levy on investigation, security and armored car services makes up $127 million of the anticipated four-year collections, according to the Department of Revenue.
In its complaint, Security Services Northwest argued the state didn’t give the company enough time to “adapt to and implement internal controls and procedures to ensure that proper sales tax is charged.”
The Department of Revenue issued guidance on companies’ obligations, including on Sept. 12 for security services. Included in the tax are private investigators, bounty hunters, security guards, fingerprinting, background checks, missing person tracking and lie detectors and polygraphs.
Security Services Northwest provides security officers, remote video monitoring and security alarm installation. It’s been in business since 1977.
The agency previously said it notified all businesses set to pay the new tax via letter or email between Aug. 13 and Aug. 22. Notices of the changes were also issued in late July. The department also hosted listening sessions with companies. 
Security Services Northwest also took issue with the tax itself, calling it a “direct tax on public safety” in a press release. And it argued the state was taxing security services unfairly compared to other professional services. 
The law, which legislators relied upon to help fund a $77.8-billion two-year operating budget, faces other legal threats.
Cable giant Comcast sued separately over a provision targeting digital advertising services. The company says the statute violates federal law because it doesn’t apply the tax to all advertising services equally.
The state has asked a Thurston County judge to dismiss the lawsuit, but this case is still pending.
The advertising services tax is projected to bring in $475 million over the next two budget cycles.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1683-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 18:02:03.399091

(Courtesy, Allyson Mathis)The retired park ranger who spotted graffiti last week in Arches National Park says she’s worried bare-bones staffing in the government shutdown is making it harder for the park to find out who’s responsible for the vandalism and clean it up. 
Allyson Mathis was hiking with a friend Nov. 5 in Devils Garden, a popular hiking area with arch and spire formations, when she spotted white paint on several rocks in the shape of hand prints, a smiley face, other shapes, and writing that said “Grug.” 
“It was so obvious that it was new, and so I’m like, ‘Shutdown-related damage. This is not good,’” Mathis said Tuesday. “When rangers are out there visible, I think people are more likely to respect the park.”

The vandalism illustrated yet another impact of the shutdown that has sidelined about 9,000 National Park Service workers who are not collecting paychecks while furloughed. The closure also halted scientific monitoring of landscapes and wildlife, said Mathis, who lives in Moab and previously was a park ranger at Grand Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef national parks.
Utah’s parks have remained open during the lapse, with the state chipping in $8,000 per day since Oct. 4 to keep visitor centers running. A slim staff of rangers is working, with a focus on keeping sightseers safe. 
“Their ability to investigate has been impaired this last number of days because they’re not fully staffed, and so they’re focusing on taking care of that life, health and safety,” Mathis said. 
She noted national parks sometimes ask the public for information to help them get to the bottom of vandalism, but that doesn’t appear to have happened as of Tuesday.

On the same hike last week, Mathis also spotted used toilet paper near the graffiti and saw someone walking a dog on the hiking trail, which is prohibited in Arches. 
The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, a nonprofit organization of former park service employees and volunteers, said the graffiti shows why the parks should be shut down for the time being. 
“We continue to call on the administration to close national parks during the shutdown until adequate staffing and protections can be restored,” the group said in an Instagram post. “Our parks don’t run themselves; they rely on dedicated public servants to keep them clean, safe, and unimpaired for future generations.”
Mathis told Utah News Dispatch she’s hopeful those who want to see national parks protected will get in touch with their representatives in Congress. 
Said Mathis: “I hope that we come together and we make it very clear to our congressional group of representatives and administration that we love these places and we want them protected.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-11 22:39:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Couple applauds same-sex decision amid concerns,Jerry Mitchell,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/11/couple-applauds-same-sex-decision/,"For one Mississippi couple, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to revisit its same-sex marriage ruling brings cautious relief.","Monday’s Supreme Court decision to deny a request to overturn its ruling that legalized same-sex marriage drew sighs of relief from same-sex couples in Mississippi.
“I’m relieved the Supreme Court let this one go,” said Kyle Harshey, who is married to the Rev. Christopher McAbee, associate rector at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Jackson. “I don’t believe the person you love is up for debate.”
More than two-thirds of Americans say that same-sex couples deserve the same rights and protections as people in traditional marriages, according to Gallup polling. Among Democrats, that support has risen this year to its highest level, 88%, while the support among Republicans has fallen from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year.

In Mississippi, support for same-sex marriage is 54%, according to a 2024 report by the Public Religion Research Institute, but the state is also home to nearly 6,000 same-sex marriages, according to 2020 U.S. Census data. 
In June, the Mississippi Baptist Convention passed a resolution calling for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision on same-sex marriage, just as justices did in reversing its historic ruling on abortion.
The Rev. Shawn Parker, executive director of the Mississippi Baptist Convention Board, said they are disappointed the Supreme Court didn’t take up the issue.
“Our convictions are that everybody should be treated with kindness, but we believe that God designed marriage for a man and a woman for life,” he said. “That serves as the context for raising children. That serves as the fabric of society.”
While there is a legal aspect to marriage, the convention’s concerns center on the sanctity of marriage, he said. “It was ordained by God in the beginning.”
These days, society disregards “God, the creator, more and more,” he said. “We’re becoming more self-focused, which is detrimental to society and ultimately detrimental to each of us. We should be God-focused and other-focused.”
Everyone looks to an authority, he said. “That authority might be my own opinions, popular culture or science or some other source, but we choose to start with the authority of God as the creator and his word and his revelation.”
The Catholic Church remains opposed to same-sex marriage, but the late Pope Francis in 2023 allowed priests to bless same-sex couples in a pastoral capacity for individuals who love one another.
The United Methodist Church in 2024 repealed its prohibitions on its ministers officiating at same-sex weddings, a factor that has led to more than 6,000 congregations leaving the denomination.
The Episcopal Church has been performing same-sex marriages since 2015. Harshey and McAbee married three years later.
McAbee said he and many others are elated over the Supreme Court decision. “I’m also feeling that it’s very important for us in the LGBTQ community to not gloat in our victory, but to remember there are so many other Americans facing injustices,” he said.
Many are being hurt by health care cuts, and “undocumented people are being terrorized by ICE,” he said.
It is a time to pause for thanksgiving, “but also a moment to remind myself that this is part of an effort to create justice for all people,” he said.
On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the petition filed by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who drew national attention for refusing to issue same-sex licenses because of her religious beliefs. She defied court orders to issue these licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court. In 2018, she lost a reelection bid.
She wanted justices to overturn an order that has required her to pay more than $300,000 in damages to the couple denied the marriage license. She also wanted the Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.
Justice Clarence Thomas was among the four justices who dissented in that opinion. He has called for reversing that decision.
Harshey said he believes Davis’ religious beliefs present “a distorted view of Christianity,” which in reality are a “shield for discrimination,” he said.
While he is “personally thankful” for the outcome, he said Monday’s action is far from the end because some justices still want to reverse the 2015 decision.

Most of the 600,000 people in the state who get SNAP benefits will receive up to 65% of their typical payment, per guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Those beneficiaries “should begin to see those payments over the next few days,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.
Conflicting court rulings and actions by the Trump administration have resulted in whiplash for people who rely on the program to pay for groceries. USDA officials first advised that funding for SNAP would not be available at all in November due to the federal government shutdown, prompting food banks to ramp up operations for an influx of new visitors.
The shutdown tug-of-war over SNAP benefits: a timeline

After a coalition of states sued, a federal judge then ordered the federal government to fully fund SNAP using available contingency money, which the Trump administration then immediately appealed. States, including Colorado, began sending full payments to people late last week before the U.S. Supreme Court issued an administrative stay of the court order. The USDA then issued a memo on Sunday directing states to send the partial payments, and called any full payments to SNAP recipients unauthorized, requesting that states “immediately undo any steps taken.”
About 32,000 Coloradans received full SNAP payments last week before the administrative stay. Polis said that Colorado has not reversed those payments because they were authorized at the time.
“Nothing is preventing the Trump administration from fully funding SNAP benefits. They are simply choosing not to,” Polis’ statement said. “The fastest way to clean up this mess would be for the federal government to drop its court appeals.”
Colorado lawmakers on the Joint Budget Committee approved a request by Polis to infuse the state’s food banks with cash while SNAP benefits were paused so they could buy enough provisions to meet increased demand.
The U.S. Senate approved a bill on Monday night to fund the government until the end of January. It would fully appropriate SNAP benefits for the year, however, avoiding another lapse should the federal government shutdown again. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill in the coming days.

State Reps. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit), Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor), Sharon MacDonnell (D-Troy), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) introduced a resolution at the end of October calling on the Wayne County Airport Authority to halt plans to open a cigar bar and restaurant within DTW, citing the negative health impacts alongside an EPIC-MRA poll from June which found 77% of voters opposed the effort. 
Though the resolution was referred to the House Government Operations Committee, which is generally considered a graveyard for policy, the southeast Michigan Democrats’ are not the only officials speaking out against the cigar bar, with the Wayne County Commission voting to formally oppose a cigar lounge within the airport. 
The plan has also drawn opposition from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, the Center for Black Health and Equity and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council.
“Everyone – including travelers and those who work at the airport – deserves the right to breathe clean, smoke-free air,” Molly Medenblik, Michigan government relations director at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in a statement. “Travelers shouldn’t have to worry about being exposed to secondhand smoke – especially when the evidence is crystal clear that it poses serious risks to a person’s health.”
In order to move forward with the proposal, the airport would also need an exemption from the state’s smoke-free indoor air law, which took effect in 2010. 
Matt Morawski, director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority said in an emailed statement that the request for proposals for a cigar bar in DTW’s McNamara Terminal was developed in response to “interest from the community and local businesses, especially as it relates to the international nature of the airport.”
As part of their proposal, bidders will be required to provide an air handling and ventilation system and facility design to reduce smoke exposure to the fullest extent possible, Morawski said. Proposals are due in February 2026. 
In a letter to the Wayne County Airport Authority, leaders from Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, the Center for Black Health and Equity and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council pointed to a 2012 study from the Centers for Disease Control which found that allowing smoking in designated areas and ventilated rooms was ineffective in eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke.
“No community group, employee organization, or public health expert has asked for a cigar lounge.” Cynthia Hallett, president and CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, said in a statement. “Airport employees should not have to choose between their health and their paycheck, and travelers should not be forced to walk past clouds of toxic smoke on their way to their gates. The Wayne County Airport Authority should align itself with public sentiment and public health guidelines and maintain a 100% smokefree DTW.”

Roy Cooper said he doesn’t support legislation that passed the U.S. Senate on Monday night to reopen the government, siding with a majority of Senate Democrats that opposed any bipartisan deal that did not address rising health care costs.
That legislation now heads to the U.S. House, where a vote expected Wednesday will likely have narrow margins. Two of North Carolina’s four House Democrats have already indicated they will vote against it.
A standoff that spanned 41 days ended Monday when a group of eight senators, including seven Democrats, broke ranks to pass a Republican-led spending package. Cooper, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the open Senate seat in North Carolina, criticized the decision in a statement Monday.
“Working families are struggling and any deal that lets health care costs continue to skyrocket is unacceptable,” Cooper said. “It’s absurd this shutdown ever happened and that Republicans used hungry children as political pawns. Washington needs to do its job and come together on a bill that tackles costs and protects health care for North Carolinians.”
Democrats in Washington had pushed for any bill ending the shutdown to also include an extension of tax credits that reduce premium costs for those who pay for health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Those tax credits expire at the end of the year; if they do, premiums will spike for millions of enrollees.
Senate Republicans have agreed to hold a vote on the issue separately next month, but passage is not guaranteed.
Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, asked about the shutdown agreement during a news conference Tuesday, called Congress’ decision “inexcusable” as he compared it to North Carolina lawmakers’ failure to reach an agreement on funding Medicaid.
“Folks deserve access to health care,” Stein said. “That’s why the active work by Congress and the administration to deprive people of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act insurance plans … or the willingness of the General Assembly to refuse to fully fund Medicaid, putting at risk the entire system, is inexcusable.”
“We’ve got to be focusing on what matters to people’s lives,” Stein said. “That’s what government needs to do in Washington, that’s what government needs to do here in Raleigh.”
U.S. House to vote on shutdown agreement. Will NC Democrats oppose it?
It remains to be seen whether any House Democrats will join their Senate colleagues in support of the bill.
The offices of two of North Carolina’s four House Democrats — U.S. Reps. Alma Adams and Valerie Foushee — did not immediately respond to requests for comments Tuesday on how they planned to vote. Rep. Deborah Ross’ office referred NC Newsline to her comments on social media.
And U.S. Rep. Don Davis, viewed as one of the most moderate Democrats in the House, said in a statement he was “reviewing” the Senate agreement, but did not say which way he would vote on it.
“I am focused on ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing,” Davis said. “The shutdown has made life harder for many families in eastern North Carolina and rural America, where resources are already limited.”
Ross and Foushee, meanwhile, have both signaled that they would oppose the measure as currently written.
Ross wrote on social media that the Senate agreement “is a bad deal for North Carolina.”
“It is a betrayal of hundreds of thousands of NC families on the verge of losing their health care,” she added.
And Foushee noted that House Speaker Mike Johnson had not yet pledged a vote on ACA subsidies like the Senate.
“I’m ready to find a solution to address the health care crisis and open the government — but this deal doesn’t do that,” Foushee wrote on social media.
Shutdown agreement creates political crossroads for Democrats
The shutdown legislation puts vulnerable Democrats in a precarious political position.
If they support the deal, they can tout having reopened the government after the longest shutdown in history — but leave themselves open to criticism from voters who see health care costs as a top issue.
Voting against the agreement, meanwhile, keeps them among a majority of elected Democrats. But it leaves them open to attacks from Republicans who, despite the GOP’s trifecta control of Congress and the White House, are likely to accuse them of trying to prolong a shutdown that temporarily cut off food benefits for low-income families and halted pay for federal workers and North Carolina’s large military communities.
That calculus is more difficult for a Democrat like Davis, who could already face a severe uphill battle for re-election in a redrawn district. And while Cooper has no primary opponents ahead of his 2026 campaign against Michael Whatley, he will face scrutiny in the general election for his stance on the shutdown as he attempts to win over moderate and conservative voters.
The Senate GOP’s campaign operation has already taken aim on the issue, tying Cooper to progressive Democrats in a statement.
“Roy Cooper stayed silent on the shutdown for over 40 days, then when he finally took a position, he came out in lockstep with Bernie Sanders and AOC,” said Nick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

WILMINGTON, Del. — For more than a generation, the Kalmar Nyckel has been more than a tall ship on the Christina — it’s been a living symbol of Delaware’s story and a place where people find each other as much as they find history.
That community spirit will be on full display Thursday, Nov. 13, when the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation celebrates a major milestone: 1 million volunteer hours logged since 2000, powered by the more than 250 men and women who sail, teach, repair, greet and guide as part of “The Tall Ship of Delaware.”
The foundation will mark the moment with a special “Join Our Volunteer Crew! Tours, Chili & Brew” event from 4 to 6:30 p.m. at the Copeland Maritime Center, 1124 E. 7th St. in Wilmington, capped by a ceremonial cannon blast at 6 p.m. to honor the millionth recorded hour. Admission, parking and chili are free; a cash bar will be available, and free ship tours will be offered from 4 to 5 p.m. Registration is required online or by calling (302) 429-7447.
The milestone underscores what many Delawareans already know: Kalmar Nyckel is as much a cultural gathering place as it is a historic replica ship.
“Reaching 1,000,000 hours is such a testament to the hard work and dedication to our amazing organization,” said Captain Sharon, who manages the year-round volunteer program and has been part of every tracked hour. “We have great shipmates who can be counted on to make anything happen on both ship and shore.”
The millionth hour was entered by sailing crew member Paul Deevy, now affectionately known aboard as “The Million-Hour Man.” Deevy will help fire the celebratory cannon from the ship’s deck Thursday evening as guests watch from the dock and the Maritime Center balcony.
Built as a full-scale replica of the 17th-century Swedish vessel that helped establish the colony of New Sweden in 1638, Kalmar Nyckel has evolved into a floating classroom, an ambassador for Delaware and a familiar backdrop for school groups, festivals, tours and waterfront events. Each year, the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation reaches more than 33,000 people through sails, dockside programs, classroom visits and community events that blend maritime history with lessons in science, economics, geography, math and teamwork.
Behind that public presence is a deep reservoir of civic commitment. Volunteers contribute roughly 40,000 hours a year — rigging sails, restoring woodwork, leading field trips, telling stories of Delaware’s early settlers and welcoming visitors from across the state and around the world.
“Come for the sailing, stay for the community of great people,” has become a mantra among volunteers, and the foundation emphasizes that no previous sailing or maritime experience is required. Prospective crew members can enroll in a Winter Crew Training course or a condensed live-aboard spring program, where they learn seamanship, safety, history and teamwork through lectures, hands-on practice and mentoring.
“The Kalmar Nyckel Foundation’s programs come to life because of our volunteers. They make the heart of our foundation beat,” Captain Sharon said. Each season, the ship travels more than 2,400 nautical miles to ports along the East Coast, carrying Delaware’s history and hospitality with it — and building strong ties among its crew.
For Delaware, the ship has become a unifying cultural touchstone: a link between past and present, city and riverfront, students and educators, longtime residents and newcomers, all woven together by the people who choose to give their time.
Those who cannot attend Thursday’s celebration will have additional chances to connect. The foundation will host Volunteer Open Houses with two-hour introductory programs at 10 a.m. on Nov. 22, Dec. 6 and Jan. 3, 2026, at the Copeland Maritime Center.

Alan Luzzatto has long opposed any development on a corner of Wheeler Nature Park in South Burlington. For the last five years, he has met with neighbors, signed petitions and tried to speak with the developer to suggest alternatives.
He was also one of the residents within 750 feet of the blasting area to receive a pre-blasting inspection notice from a survey company hired by Maine Drilling & Blasting that is expected to work on the parcel. Blasting is supposed to begin in November and expected to last through January.
“I never understood how a development could be built upon a legally standing nature park,” he said.

Neighbors have for years opposed a plan by owner JAM Golf LLC and BlackRock Construction to build a 32-unit mixed housing project with roadway and utility access on an undeveloped 6.9-acre parcel at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road in South Burlington. The site is directly adjacent to the 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park — widely considered a local treasure for its sweeping views of the Green Mountains.
The recent blasting notices to build on undeveloped land that has bedrock signal an end to the yearslong fight. No work permits have been pulled yet for any site work to take place at 550 Park Road, according to city officials. Ben Avery, vice president of development at BlackRock, declined to comment.
Although the Wheeler Nature Park was purchased and preserved in perpetuity for light recreation by the city more than 35 years ago, the 6.9-acre parcel was created as part of a settlement with JAM Golf in 2015 and is now privately owned, city documents note. 
BlackRock Construction won development review board approval to build on the land in 2021 and cleared the state’s Act 250 permit in July 2022, but the permit was soon appealed by a group of 125 neighbors and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting.

The case has lagged through the courts since, until June, when the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the latest arguments opposing the housing project. More than 500 residents then signed a petition calling on the City Council to buy back the parcel or encourage landowner JAM Golf  to donate it back to the city.
“While I am a fervent advocate for conservation, after this almost two decade process, there is nothing that the City can plausibly do at this point to halt that development,” City Councilor Andrew Chalnick wrote in an Oct. 19 email to petitioners.
“We are keenly aware that many people are paying close attention to the plan for development of this neighborhood and that a petition was submitted to the City Council to seek alternatives,” Planning and Zoning Director Paul Connor said. 
He added that the city has been committed to being “even-handed and transparent” throughout the project. 

“As the approved 32-home neighborhood at 550 Park Road moves towards its construction phase, we will continue to do the same,” he said. 
City Council members did not respond to a request for comment, but neighbors are making a last ditch effort to stop shovels from going into the ground.
There are very few places like the nature park in the city, said Rose Goddard, who lives less than a mile away from the slated development. 
“I call it the crown jewel of South Burlington,” she said.
The South Burlington Land Trust’s board voted unanimously to support the petition, according to board President Rosanne Greco.
“It is an open land that ought to be preserved because of its natural resources, fertile soils, wildlife habitat,” she said. “… I think we need it in our lives.”
The development, according to Greco, a former city councilor, will almost certainly adversely affect the groundwater and soil at the Wheeler homestead nearby that features a historic home with master gardens, community garden plots, walking trails and a dog park.
“There are so many reasons not to destroy natural open spaces like this that it almost doesn’t need explanation. But of course it does because most people don’t think this way,” she said.

Goddard said she voted years ago for the city to keep the parcel as part of the nature park instead of the land swap that eventually took place and has paved the way for development.
“The horse is out of the barn,” she said. “I feel very sad for the future generations.”
The suburban development will destroy the wide trail, obscure the last remaining views of the Green Mountains from Dorset Street and endanger wildlife in the park, the petition states. 
“I don’t understand why the support is not there with so many people interested in saving the park,” said Jeanne Zagursky, one of the organizers of the effort to protect the parcel slated for development. “It’s not logical to me. I feel like there’s something not right with the system.” 
When blasting last happened in the area earlier this year, it was loud, constant and terrifying, she recalled. 
“Every single time your heart jumps and animals scramble and you’re just hoping that your basement’s not cracking. It’s not good,” she said.
“Unberarable” and “incessant” drilling measured up to 90 decibels when luxury homes were built in 2023 — also by BlackRock — on a section off Long Drive that had extensive ledge underground. 
South Burlington recently approved standards for review of bedrock removal during development. These include limiting drilling and blasting to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., The Other Paper reported.
The fight against the development has left the 78-year-old Luzzatto dispirited. 
“I’ve given up. That’s the sad part of it. We pretty much tried everything,” he said. “And frankly, we are all worn out.”

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)An interesting thing happened in New Mexico on Monday.
Lawmakers, angry over the federal government’s insistence it can’t pay November federal aid for food stamps, held a special legislative session to approve the use of up to $163 million in state funds to help cover the lapse through the holidays if needed. Acting Gov. Howie Morales (D) swiftly signed the bill.
Leaders coming together to help their most vulnerable constituents through an emergency — what an idea!
Things are different on this side of the country, where our state’s leaders have opted not to use emergency funds for the same purpose. It’s not that we don’t have the money. It’s that our leaders believe this is President Donald Trump’s problem to solve, not theirs.
Gov. Phil Murphy (D), speaking to reporters last week the day after Democrats trounced Republicans at the ballot box, said Trump fighting not to pay out federal aid for food stamps is “cruel” (food stamps, or EBT, are bureaucratically called SNAP, for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
“They’re sitting on about $6 billion, and they’re choosing to allow people to go hungry, 800,000 New Jerseyans. That’s a choice that they’ve made,” Murphy said.
He’s referring to a roughly $6 billion federal fund that is supposed to pay out food stamp benefits in the event of a government shutdown, like the current one. Trump initially refused to tap that fund, then gave some to states to deliver to SNAP recipients, and now wants some money back.
You know who else is sitting on a $6 billion emergency fund? New Jersey. The current state budget has a $6.7 billion surplus, but Murphy did not tap it to cover the cost of food stamps even as Trump seeks to deny the funds.

“No state in America, including New Jersey, can step into the shoes, the financial, existentially important shoes of the federal administration, in terms of whether it’s health care premiums, whether it’s Medicaid, SNAP. So we’ll do our best. As you’ve seen with SNAP, we’ve taken a whole range of steps, but the federal government is the big gorilla on any program like health care or food stamps. We’ll do our best at the edges, but we need Congress and the administration and Washington to step up and do their part,” Murphy told reporters Monday.
If New Jersey decided to fully cover food stamps for a single month, it would cost about $170 million. That’s 2.5% of the surplus. The budget is $58.8 billion.
Murphy’s successor, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), sides with the governor.
“Our state budget is very tight. There’s a lot more work we need to do to address affordability issues, including in utility costs, health care costs and housing costs. So at a minimum, the federal government has to do what it’s legally now required to do, and support the SNAP funding,” Sherrill said in Newark last week.
I understand that food stamps are a federal program and it’s incumbent on the federal government to pay for them, and that New Jersey footing the bill is not a long-term solution. I also understand that the federal government may reopen in days, potentially making this specific problem moot (or not, depending on Trump’s mood). But the food stamp chaos is wreaking havoc on the lives of our poorest residents, and Trenton owes it to them to do more than start a SNAP task force or deploy the National Guard to help food banks.
Craig Mainor is executive director of United Community Corp., which runs seven community refrigerators and three food pantries in Essex County and serves about 10,000 meals a month to the county’s low-income residents. Mainor said he saw a “huge increase” in the number of people seeking help from his nonprofit when aid for food stamps was halted at the start of the month.
“There has been an eye-opener for some folks who thought that they would never need it, but now need it. Even when they were collecting SNAP benefits, they didn’t necessarily have to go to the shelters or the food distributions. But now that that’s been cut off, they find themselves in line, taking off from work for some of them. Some of them are seniors who are now forced to stand in line,” he said. “The eye-opener is that at any moment we can all be in a line for food.”
That may all be sorted out in days, either with the federal government reopening or the U.S. Supreme Court deciding not to side with Trump on this matter. But we should not forget that, with a monsoon raging, the state sat on a $6.7 billion rainy-day fund and didn’t use one cent of it to help with the deluge.

(Photo illustration by Mario Tama/Getty ImagesLeaders of several national health equity organizations this week called for the New Mexico Legislature to consider expanding Medicaid coverage to include anti-obesity medications during the upcoming regular 30-day session.
Organizations such as the National Hispanic Health Foundation, National Hispanic Council on Aging, League of United Latin American Citizens, MANA and the American Diabetes Association sent letters to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and several state lawmakers this week asking that they take action during the session, which begins in January 2026. The letters encourage lawmakers to help expand access to chronic disease treatments, particularly for people who belong to historically disadvantaged communities.
“Over the past decade, the state has seen the steepest rise in obesity rates in the nation — a ten-point surge that has pushed adult obesity to 36.3%,” a statement from the organizations reads. “This growing crisis falls hardest on those already confronting health inequities: Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans, as well as women, particularly those in low-income households.”
According to a 2023 report by the Health Equity Coalition for Chronic Diseases, managing the underlying causes of obesity and the conditions the disease causes create significant out-of-pocket costs that “rose by 37% over the last decade—and that’s just for those with private insurance,” the report reads. 
The report notes that 45.6% of Hispanic adults in the country live with obesity — the second-highest rate among minority groups following non-Hispanic Black adults. The report adds that particularly among Hispanic residents in the U.S., higher rates of obesity are linked to a lack of access to healthy, affordable food; safe spaces to exercise; and stable, affordable housing.
According to a report by the Childhood Obesity Intervention Cost-Effectiveness Study (CHOICES), the overall prevalence of obesity among New Mexico adults was 42.8% in 2020. The highest rates were recorded among Hispanic and Black adults, low-income residents and women. The report projects the overall rate among adults in the state will increase to 51.8% by 2030.
“New Mexicans on Medicaid deserve access to breakthrough obesity therapies that will not only save lives, reduce costs, and help dismantle long-standing inequities in care, but also improve outcomes across the state,” the organizations’ letter states.
The American Diabetes Association notes that addressing the disease of obesity requires “person-centered” treatment that includes various screenings, intensive behavioral therapy, access to Federal Drug Administration-approved medications and access to bariatric or metabolic surgeries when recommended by a health professional.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ozempic1731962374.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:02:03.399091

This story by Randolph T. Holhut was first published in The Commons on Nov. 11, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — Plans are moving forward to set up an emergency overnight shelter this winter to fill what organizers say is the need “to offer a warm and welcoming overnight space for adults during the coldest months of the year.”
More than 50 people gathered at the Beloved Community Church — the congregation formed by the collaboration of the First United Methodist and First Baptist churches — on Town Crier Drive for a meeting that outlined plans for the overnight shelter, which would be housed at the church between Dec. 1 and March 31.

“It’s wonderful to see human decency in action,” said Ralph Howe, pastor of First United Methodist Church.
Initial setup costs for the Beloved Winter Shelter are being funded by a grant from the state’s Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program. According to its website, the ECWSP “is designed to support community-based emergency shelter operations during periods of extreme cold for individuals experiencing homelessness who have no other safe housing option.”
The ECWSP grant will cover staffing and operating costs for 20 of the coldest nights this winter, kicking in when temperatures plummet below 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But organizers say they intend to have the new shelter open for the other 100 nights and are in the process of fundraising to cover those costs, estimated at $222,000. So far, about $77,000 has been raised.
The shelter would run in a similar way to the Winter Overflow Shelter that existed in the former sanctuary of the First Baptist Church on Main Street for about a decade, until 2017.
The new shelter would be open every night from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., with capacity for eight people most nights, with up to 15 cots allowed on the 20 coldest nights. Organizers say they are trying to get an exemption from state regulators to have 15 cots available for all 120 nights.
The cots, which will be set up in the church’s fellowship hall, would be available each night on a first-come, first-serve basis. There would be no overnight storage of belongings, and guests would be required to take everything with them when they leave.
Organizers say it will be run as a “low-barrier” shelter for guests over the age of 18. Alcohol, drugs or weapons will not be allowed, and anyone who leaves during the night cannot check back in. “We’re trying to get as many people in here as we can,” said Eileen Glover, a member of the shelter’s steering committee. “We’re not going have lots of strict guidelines. It’s for the people with the most need on the coldest nights.”
Unlike the former First Baptist shelter, no meals will be served. Instead, snacks and beverages will be provided. Another difference is that there will be a mix of paid staff and volunteers running the shelter each night. Training will be provided for everyone involved with the shelter, with an emphasis on what organizers described as “de-escalation, first aid, and mental-health awareness.”
Filling the need
Last winter, the state’s hotel shelter program was winding down and the shelter spaces run by Groundworks Collaborative were at maximum capacity. In the absence of an emergency shelter set up by the town, Cristina Shayonye and other Brattleboro community members raised and spent $3,000 on motel rooms to get people off the streets during the coldest nights.
While this effort succeeded in helping some people, Shayonye said it was “hectic and unsustainable,” and a more permanent solution is needed. At the same time that a shelter site was being sought, a community center on 69A Elliot Street opened in the spring to serve as a daytime downtown gathering place.
Started by Katie Bachler and Scott Berzofsky, 69A is open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and offers free coffee, tea, water, Wi-Fi access and various gear and supplies (including tents, sleeping bags, flashlights and clothing). It was designed as a place to relax and regroup, with “restrooms, music, and people to talk to,” according to a 69A flyer.
Several of the people involved with 69A, including Shayonye, are part of the Beloved Shelter steering committee. They see the Beloved Shelter as an extension of the resources they’ve been providing on Elliot Street. “We were looking for a place to open its doors to us, and we couldn’t find one last year,” said Shayonye. “And this church, the Beloved Community Church, opened its doors to us this year, and this [ECWSP] grant came along. With an actual location and the grant money, we won’t have to put people in motel rooms this winter.”
Glover, one of the sheter’s steering committee members, said the Beloved Shelter organizers have been working with organizations in other local communities. “They’ve gratefully shared their documents with us so we weren’t building everything from scratch,” she said. “We are figuring out what the structure is going to look like, how we are operating, what the safety and procedures are while we are here.”
Training will be provided for shelter volunteers, including spending time at 69A to learn more about the people the shelter will be serving.
Thinking creatively
Organizers stressed that the Beloved Shelter is not specifically connected to Groundworks. “We are collaborating and are in constant communication with the other organizations in town that provide services, but this is its own entity with its own fiscal sponsor,” said steering committee member Elizabeth Moriarty.
“We are educators, clergy, activists, parents, psychiatric nurses and neighbors — people who are connected to this community and deeply care about it who are wanting to connect with our other neighbors,” she continued. “We work in deep partnership with other agencies, elected officials and other people of goodwill, but we are an ad hoc collective.”
Groundworks Executive Director Libby Bennett said at the meeting that the nonprofit’s overnight shelter is often full and presents more barriers than what the Beloved Shelter is planning.
She noted that the state programs to offer shelter in motels “have been pared way down, so that is basically for families,” she said. “We’re down to just one motel in town that can take single people. So that’s where this shelter comes in.”
This program is far from adequate to meet the problem at hand, the organizers said. The Beloved Shelter will be “one option that didn’t exist last winter,” said Shayoyne. “There needs to be more than this.”
“The problem is systemic and vast, and we need different pieces and creative solutions that defy categories,” Moriarty added.
Skyberry House, a Brattleboro nonprofit that has been operating what it calls “a house of hospitality” modeled on the Catholic Worker houses started in the 1930s, is the nonprofit fiscal agent for the new shelter, Moriarty said. She said donations will be handled through Skyberry with complete openness and accountability about budgeting and spending.
“We want to do this because it’s needed,” Moriarty said, “and we want you to be a part of it because we can’t do it by ourselves.” Shayoyne said it’s about “neighbors helping neighbors, and when you have more than you need and you see someone who doesn’t have enough at all, then you pitch in and share.”
“That’s what kind of shelter it is,” she added.

Those interested in serving as paid overnight hosts or shelter staff, or serving as volunteer to help set up the shelter at the beginning of the evening and cleaning up in the morning, can contact the steering committee at belovedwintershelter@gmail.com.
Donations for the shelter can be mailed to Beloved Winter Shelter, in care of Skyberry House, P.O. Box 360, Brattleboro, VT 05302. Be sure to make checks payable to Skyberry House, with “Beloved Winter Shelter” written in the memo line.

Cook told ISU community members during a public forum last week that returning to ISU would be like coming home, as he grew up in Ames and completed his undergraduate education at the university. He said at the time he would not come back just to “reinvent the wheel” if selected, but to build on the legacy Wintersteen left and bring ISU to new heights.
Wintersteen announced her plans to retire in May, after which the board of regents contracted with AGB Search and formed a committee to review candidates. Working with a timeline described by AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis as “very, very, very tight,” the presidential search committee spent the summer creating a presidential profile and going through applicants, eventually narrowing down a pool of 78 people to eight semifinalists.
Of the four finalists selected for in-person interviews and public inquiry through forums, only two ended up coming to campus last week — Cook and Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Benjamin Houlton.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana and federal officials are taking legal action against Smitty’s Supply Inc., seeking fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations and the recent industrial fire and mass spillage at its petroleum products plant in Tangipahoa Parish. 
An attorney for private litigants worries that such a high amount, if awarded, could become an obstacle for neighbors and local businesses seeking their own reparations. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans. They allege a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and similar state laws and regulations for incidents going back nearly five years. The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.
“Plaintiffs ask this Court to hold Defendant accountable for unlawfully polluting the Nation’s and the State’s waters, and to require Defendant to take all appropriate measures to prevent future spills or discharges,” the lawsuit states.
Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.
Its Roseland plant, which bottles and manufactures a wide variety of oils, fluids and petrochemical products for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers, was almost completely destroyed in the August disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding as much as 11 million gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while millions of gallons of oil and chemicals stored at the plant contaminated public land and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA. 
Flowing through a series of ditches and channels, the hazardous substances entered the river through at least four separate points of entry, the lawsuit notes. 
The EPA estimates cleanup crews have recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity, from nearby ponds, rivers and drainage channels.
Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s concerned the government’s lawsuit could leave little money for Tangipahoa residents and other private litigants with claims related to the disaster. Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.
“To the extent they have to pay penalties, it takes away available funds to compensate folks,” Garside said. 
Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office would offer further comment on the case.
Shortly before the government filed its complaint, Garside said U.S. Department of Justice attorneys contacted him to ask about Louisiana Environmental Action Network claims and to confirm a filing deadline, adding that he expected its lawsuit to be filed before his. 
Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.
The state’s claims in the lawsuit carry significantly lighter penalties of up to $32,500 per violation per day. 
Smitty’s has filed its own lawsuit, blaming the disaster on two other businesses — the New York-based Fulton Thermal Corp., whuch manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and Baton Rouge’s J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, which installs and maintains the tanks. Smitty’s alleges the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire but hasn’t said how or why it malfunctioned.
State and federal environmental officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or mitigated its impacts.  
They accuse Smitty’s of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations. 
The agencies allege the company failed to implement EPA-required plans for oil spill prevention and emergency response and repeatedly failed to comply with other laws regulating pollutant discharges during the years leading up to the fire.
Lawsuit details prior violations
The state and EPA complaint cites hundreds of previous wastewater discharge, pollution reporting and permit exceedance violations going back three years, as well as seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that reached offsite and contaminated public areas. 
One occurred July 21, 2024, involving 950 gallons of hydraulic oil that spilled from a burst railcar transfer line. While cleaning up the initial spill, the oil spilled a second time when the facility’s oil-water separator tank overflowed. It went into a ditch along U.S. Highway 51, flowed into a nearby creek and then to a private pond, creating 14,000 gallons of contaminated material that had to be removed, the complaint states. 
Another spill the following month, on Aug. 30, 2024, involved a 55-gallon drum of Navilan Yellow 73, a dye added to other fluids for the purpose of detecting spills and leaks. The dye spilled into a drainage ditch along Highway 51 and migrated to a pond on private property. It’s unclear if it was the same pond that had been contaminated the month before. 
The lawsuit discusses some of the impacts the most recent incident had on the Tangipahoa River, which flows into Lake Pontchartrain, though officials have said the contaminants were blocked before reaching the lake. The incident shut down a 47-mile-long section of the river, which only recently reopened after being closed to the public for over two months. 
“Defendant’s unauthorized discharge … was toxic to human, plant, or animal life or significantly increased health risks due to exposure to the substances or consumption of contaminated fish or other aquatic life,” the filing states.
Recovery and cleanup efforts in the area are still ongoing more than two months after the incident, and the court filing points out that oil and other hazardous substances on the site still pose risk. 
“As of the filing of this Complaint, the cleanup of the discharge is ongoing, but there is still a threat of another discharge if there is a significant rainfall event,” the lawsuit states. “Although a temporary storm water collection is in place at the Facility, it may not be able to withstand significant rainfall.”
One of the EPA’s claims carries a potential penalty of up to $7,093 per barrel of oil discharged. With 11 million gallons of waste recovered, that penalty could total as much as $1.8 billion if the court finds the company acted with “gross negligence or willful misconduct” and awards the maximum fine. Potential penalties for the other claims listed could reach hundreds of millions.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 21:42:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT officials, hospital staff celebrate UConn takeover of Waterbury Hospital",Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/ct-uconn-health-waterbury-hospital-sale/,"Some took the opportunity to slam the hospital’s current owner—formerly private equity-backed hospital operator, Prospect Medical Holdings.","Over 100 people gathered Tuesday morning at Waterbury Hospital to celebrate the hospital’s acquisition by the state’s flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The announcement marks the culmination of a years-long saga to find a new owner for the facility, which has, at times, seemed on the brink of closure. 
Elected officials and executives called the moment a “restart” for the hospital. A few also took the opportunity to slam the hospital’s current owner — the bankrupt, formerly private equity-backed hospital operator, Prospect Medical Holdings.
“We have finally reached a point where we are going to invest in people over profits. Goodbye Prospect,” UConn Health Board Chair John Driscoll said, eliciting cheers and applause from the crowd. 
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell Waterbury Hospital, along with its two other Connecticut facilities, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”
Over the last six months, state officials have been hard at work to negotiate Waterbury Hospital’s purchase by UConn Health. The deal would save Waterbury Hospital from closure and help support Gov. Ned Lamont’s goal to improve the financial sustainability of UConn Health, state and hospital officials say. 
“It wasn’t easy. It took a little navigating to get this done over the last six months,” Lamont said. “But this is a good thing for Waterbury, a really good thing for Waterbury Hospital, and it’s a good thing for the UConn Health system generally.”
The acquisition is structured as a “public-private partnership.” Waterbury Hospital will be part of the UConn Health network, but remain private. 
Last week, the state submitted a $13 million bid to purchase the hospital, including $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
Prospect originally paid $31.8 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital in 2016. While the state is purchasing Waterbury for less than half of what it was worth almost a decade ago, the facility will require deep investments to address significant quality issues. 
During a special session of the state legislature this week, lawmakers will vote to approve $390 million in bonding over a five-year period to support capital investments in Waterbury, as well as Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, which the state is also in talks to acquire. 
Some level of forgiveness for the taxes Prospect owes the state will also be a part of the deal. Court records show that Prospect owes the state $127 million in hospital provider taxes going back more than three years. However, those negotiations are happening separately and not explicitly included in the bid submitted last week. 
The bonding package on the agenda for the special session beginning on Wednesday has widespread bipartisan support, Comptroller Sean Scanlon said. 
“Every single legislative caucus leader has supported this project, and you’re going to see a massive, overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of this on Wednesday and Thursday. Democrats and Republicans all understand this,” Scanlon said.
Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, said he would vote ‘yes’ on the bonding package, and thanked Lamont and Scanlon for their commitment to finding a solution.
“A lot of folks ask: What’s going to happen to the hospital? What’s going to happen to my job? What does it mean for health care in this area?” Polletta said. “This is going to solve that problem.”
Hospital employees, who were overjoyed by the announcement, said investments in the hospital should go towards infrastructure and technology upgrades, as well as supplies and staff.
“I’m tired of looking for IV pumps, working cardiac monitors, a chair to sit in. I mean, literally something that simple,” Marilyn Anthony, a registered nurse who has worked at the hospital for over 20 years, said. “And staff. I want staff.”
Anthony, who is 65, said she put off her own retirement so she could stay on board after the state’s acquisition to help rebuild the hospital’s operations.
Lamont said another goal of the partnership is for the expanded UConn Health network to help provide broader access to high quality, low-cost care. State employee and retiree health plans will incentivize participants to go to UConn Health and Waterbury Hospital, where, Lamont said, “you get the very best value there is.” 
When asked whether he supported a public option in Connecticut, which Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, called for during a press conference Monday, Lamont joked that he had “concepts of a plan.”
“I refer to it as the ‘Connecticut option,’” Lamont said. “One step at a time, but obviously we’d like to incentivize people and give them an opportunity to play into this preferred network. And state employees would be a big piece of that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lamont-waterbury-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

,DC,2025-11-11 21:40:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The shutdown tug-of-war over SNAP benefits: a timeline,"Jacob Fischler, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-tug-war-over-snap-benefits-timeline,,"Payments for November for the nation’s main food assistance program have been delayed during the government shutdown, amid a confusing mess of contradicting guidance from the Trump administration and a flurry of court orders in two cases at every level of the federal judiciary.The off-and-on freeze of benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that serves about 42 million people, was among the most consequential effects of the record-setting shutdown. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans use SNAP to help buy groceries.Lawmakers, advocates and judges all repeatedly called for urgency to restore the program to keep Americans from going hungry. Yet the dizzying back-and-forth continued, often leaving both states and families at a loss.While the shutdown is likely to end this week, the legal fight continues over the responsibilities of the federal government, which funds SNAP, and the states that administer the program.Here’s a timeline of events over 42 days since Congress failed to appropriate new funding for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1:Sept. 30, 2025: On the brink of the current shutdown, the Trump U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes a plan for how its various programs will be affected. It says SNAP benefits will continue to flow from a $6 billion contingency fund during a shutdown.“Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds,” the document reads in part.States Newsroom discloses the document is later removed from USDA’s website.Oct. 1: Congress fails to appropriate any money for discretionary government programs. The federal government shuts down. USDA pays October SNAP benefits.Oct. 10: USDA sends a letter to states telling them not to pay SNAP benefits for November, a reversal from its Sept. 30 plan.Oct. 24: USDA tells states in a memo that it will not pay November SNAP benefits, even though it held billions in a contingency fund.  Oct. 28: Democratic states sue USDA in Massachusetts federal court, seeking to force the department to pay for November benefits.Oct. 30: Nonprofits, religious groups and municipal governments bring a similar suit in Rhode Island federal court. Oct. 31: In an initial hearing in the Rhode Island case, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. says he is ordering USDA to continue SNAP benefits in November.In the Massachusetts case, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani rules that withholding November benefits is illegal, but gives the administration until Nov. 3 to respond.Nov. 1: McConnell issues a written ruling laying out two options for USDA: pay full benefits for November by Nov. 3 or partial benefits by Nov. 5.Some SNAP recipients begin to miss benefit payments. The program administers benefits on a rolling basis throughout each month, so more people are affected every day the department is not authorizing benefits.Nov. 3: In a filing in McConnell’s court, USDA says it will pay about half of November benefits. But it says the administrative difficulties of calculating partial benefits could take weeks or even months.Nov. 4, just after 11 a.m. Eastern: President Donald Trump posts to Truth Social that SNAP benefits will not be paid until Democrats agree to reopen the government. At the White House press briefing in the afternoon, press secretary Karoline Leavitt walks back that post and says Trump was referring to future benefits.Nov. 5, late: In a memo to states, USDA corrects a table for the amount of partial benefits households should receive based on income, size of household and other factors. USDA says the table fulfills its duty under McConnell’s Nov. 1 order to pay partial benefits by this date. Nov. 6: McConnell orders the USDA to pay full November benefits by the next day. His earlier order was clear that partial benefits must be paid by Nov. 5, he said. Because recipients did not receive their benefits, the government missed that deadline, and it must pay for the whole month, he says. He also notes Trump’s Truth Social post appeared to defy the order.States, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Oregon, begin to authorize full November benefits. Nov. 7, 8:53 a.m. Eastern: The department appeals McConnell’s order the day before to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Nov. 7, midday: Despite its morning appeal, the USDA issues guidance to states greenlighting full November benefits. A USDA spokesperson says the department must comply with McConnell’s order.Consistent with the USDA guidance, more states begin to authorize full November benefits.Nov. 7, evening: The Trump administration asks the U.S. Supreme Court to issue an emergency stay of the 1st Circuit and district court orders that it provide full November benefits that day.Nov. 7, just before 10 p.m. Eastern: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson orders an administrative stay while the 1st Circuit appeal is pending. The order temporarily halts the lower courts’ order to provide benefits.Nov. 8, late: Following the Supreme Court stay, USDA sends states a letter demanding they “immediately undo” any moves to provide full SNAP benefits. The letter threatens to cancel other federal funding for states that don’t comply. Nov. 9, late night: A 1st Circuit panel affirms McConnell’s order. The trial judge was within his right to order USDA pay full November benefits, the three-judge panel says.Nov. 10: The Trump administration continues its Supreme Court appeal, even as the shutdown nears its end and the 1st Circuit has ruled on the appeal.Talwani issues a restraining order on the Nov. 8 letter asking states to “undo” November benefit payments. At a hearing, she says USDA has created the confusion and that states were acting in line with court orders and the department’s own guidance.The U.S. Senate approves a bill to reopen the government and fund SNAP, sending the measure to the House. Later this week: The U.S. House is expected to clear the Senate bill; Trump is expected to sign it. The Supreme Court could rule on the administration's request to freeze the lower court orders. It is not clear when full November benefits will flow to households.Text by Jacob Fischler/timeline graphic by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom.",,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

“All I know is love one another and be good to each other,” he said.
The centenarian was born in rural Sallis, in central Mississippi’s Attala County, on Sept. 18, 1923, the seventh of eight children. His father was a sharecropper, and he spent his childhood farming with his family and went to school part-time.
Anderson now lives  in Goodman in Holmes County. One of his daughters, Dorothy Falls, is retired and takes care of him. His home is right next to his two-acre garden and a restaurant owned by his son Ricky, called Rick’s Drive Inn. Anderson still spends time in his garden.

In 1943, Anderson was sent to Fort Eustis in Virginia for training after being drafted to the Army during World War II.
He said he spent six months in basic training and combat training. However, he was discharged after training and never saw combat. To this day, he doesn’t know why.
“They shipped everybody out but me,” he said. “I never did understand it. They didn’t tell me nothing. They just gave me a discharge.”
Anderson’s experience in training does provide him with a respect of the military. He said he wanted to express his appreciation to all veterans as they are honored on the national holiday.
After training, Anderson returned to being a farmer while also taking on various jobs across the country to support his wife, Annie Lou, and their eight children. He and Annie Lou married the same year he went to training.

Anderson’s jobs spanned from Memphis to Chicago and more. But he has always come back to his home state.
“I guess I like Mississippi better than I did anywhere else,” he said.
Anderson became a custodian and later bus driver at Goodman-Pickens Elementary School, retiring in 2005. He was ordained as a deacon in 1947. Annie Lou passed away in 1993, after 73 years of marriage. 
In 2023, the year Anderson turned 100 years old, the Mississippi House of Representatives adopted a resolution to honor him for his service.
The resolution says Anderson “shot the (large) 40MM guns and remained a steadfast and brave soldier for the United States of America.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/07141936/James-Anderson-1.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 21:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"With SNAP funding in flux, Hartford grocer worries of economic impact",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/snap-funding-grocery-business-economy-ct/,"Federally-mandated changes to SNAP could push many shoppers off the rolls, creating uncertainty for small businesses like Grocery on Broad.","For the past year and a half, the Grocery on Broad has helped fill a gap for residents of Hartford’s Frog Hollow neighborhood. 
In an area known as a “food swamp”, where food can be purchased but quality and healthy items are limited, the nonprofit grocery store has become a key source for fresh produce, meat and pantry staples, enabling families to buy foods they once needed to travel out of Hartford to get.  
But the first week of November saw a change: fewer shoppers came in to make purchases at the beginning of the month, usually the busiest time for the small grocer. 
“There are definitely people who would normally be shopping who simply cannot,” said Ben Dubow, the executive director of Forge City Works, the nonprofit that operates the Grocery on Broad and Fire by Forge, a popular Hartford restaurant. 
The change in traffic was the result of the 42-day-long federal shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. As congressional lawmakers grapple with funding the government, the pause in funding is having significant effects on the national economy, with thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay, flights grounded due to staffing shortages, and consumer spending slowing down as discretionary money dries up. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office found that the shutdown could cost the US economy as much as $14 billion.
For Dubow, some of the biggest difficulties and points of concern have come from changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Once known as food stamps, the federal nutrition program supports some 42 million Americans — including 360,000 Connecticut residents — who cannot afford food, by supplementing the grocery budgets of low-income workers or in some cases, covering food costs entirely.  
Federal funding for the program lapsed for the first time ever on Nov. 1, as the Trump administration argued that, with the shutdown in effect, it could not spend emergency funds to extend benefits into November.
With more than half of their shoppers reliant on SNAP, the lapse immediately raised concerns for Dubow and the staff of the Grocery on Broad. 
In the short term, Dubow said he’s worried about what lower shopping activity could mean for both consumers unable to pay for much-needed groceries and for the store’s inventory, especially the fresh items that have spent a little more time sitting on the shelf instead of being used in fresh meals. 
In the long term, he worries about what the lapse could mean for the economy, particularly the larger supply chain the store fits into.
“The food ecosystem is really complex and has a huge economic impact,” he said. “It helps create jobs and sustain jobs within an industry that actually can provide good jobs to people.” 
That concern over SNAP funding has transformed into a sense of uncertainty in recent days, as federal courts have weighed in on the Trump administration’s argument that it could not fund SNAP in November. That argument has been found lacking as courts have called for the program to be fully funded, even as the administration continues to push back on doing so. 
Connecticut officials meanwhile, recently ended their debate over the best way to plug the funding hole, with Gov. Ned Lamont announcing last week that the state would immediately restore funds for SNAP recipients, enabling them to fully use their benefits in November. That money has already been disbursed even as the Trump administration tries to pressure states into pulling the funding back.
Nationally, the matter could end soon: In the past 48 hours, a Senate majority has moved to end the shutdown, with the House expected to vote this week.  
Ending the shutdown would remove some of the worries that have weighed on Dubow recently. But more broadly, the community he’s working to serve still faces longstanding issues around food security and affordability, issues that have been amplified as inflation and tariffs continue to eat into consumer spending and as SNAP faces federally-mandated changes that could push millions of Americans off of the rolls in the coming months. 
The shutdown, he fears, could be a preview of issues likely to crop up in the future.  
“We’re asking people to sometimes make life-and-death type decisions about where they’re spending their very limited dollars in a world where everything’s getting more expensive,” he said.  
The SNAP lapse has had ripple effects on broader economy — including on those who aren’t in the program
In recent weeks economists have highlighted that SNAP affects more than those directly enrolled. 
That’s largely for two reasons. First, SNAP contributes a significant amount of the money spent at grocery stores nationwide — roughly $8 billion a month according to some estimates. Second, SNAP money is well-known to have something economists refer to as a multiplier effect: for every $1 of SNAP money spent, it produces somewhere between $1.50 and $1.80 in economic impact. 
Grocery stores are just one beneficiary of that impact. According to federal data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2023, SNAP benefits produced some $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers. Roughly half of that spending was at major retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Costco. An additional quarter was at supermarkets.  
SNAP has an even bigger impact on small independent grocery stores in rural or food insecure areas, which often have a limited customer base and narrow profit margins. The consistent spending of SNAP recipients at these stores can be the difference between them staying open or shutting down entirely.
The National Grocers Association, which represents independent community grocers, acknowledged as much in a statement released last month. “With SNAP fueling over 389,000 American jobs and generating $1.54 in economic activity for every dollar invested in the program, grocers’ staffing and inventory are planned around benefit cycles,” said NGA President Greg Ferrara. “A lapse in funding could lead to reduced employee hours, perishable food losses and declining sales.”
In a region like New England, where roughly $364 million dollars of SNAP funding circulates through the economy each month, that loss could be expensive as families tighten their budgets even further to pay for groceries. 
Even with restored SNAP benefits, headwinds remain
Restoring SNAP benefits won’t completely erase the issue. 
Food prices have risen considerably, roughly 3.2% from August 2024 to August 2025, according to federal data. That inflation, along with the continued impact of tariffs on imported goods, means that people are spending more to keep their pantries stocked.
At the Grocery on Broad, prices are kept in check through a sliding scale discount system where shoppers self-report their income and are then given a corresponding discount on items purchased at the store. Dubow notes that in recent months, more people are coming into the store to take advantage of the discounts, a sign he says of a growing difficulty affording things. 
And with the increased strain, Dubow notes that he is worried about the SNAP program. The program is slated for a number of changes as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law in July; New work requirements and a looming shift of some administrative costs from the federal government onto states could force millions of people out of the program. 
The pain is expected to be pronounced in Connecticut, with families in the state projected to lose an average of $200 a month in benefits under the changes — one of the hardest hits in the country. 
A recent analysis from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, notes that the structural changes to SNAP will likely blunt the program’s ability to help the nation respond to recessions, as people will struggle to access benefits that could help them weather an economic downturn.
If that happens, the economic effects could be felt by a larger group than SNAP recipients alone — like the small businesses that serve many people who use SNAP to pay for food. 
For now, Dubow is focused on supporting his store’s patrons, and encouraging people across Hartford to take advantage of the Grocery on Broad. And he’s been encouraged by how the state government and a network of nonprofits and community organizations have addressed the funding lapse, working quickly to maintain access to food for vulnerable people in the state. 
But he said he hopes that as the immediate SNAP crisis nears its end, more people begin to see how valuable the program is. 
“This has targeted economic impact,” he said of SNAP. “When it goes away, the negative impact it has is not just on individuals who can’t eat and kids who can’t eat. It really impacts small businesses and farmers and the whole system.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WBC_5408.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s multi-billion dollar hemp industry is in jeopardy of collapsing due to federal legislation approved by the U.S. Senate on Monday night, and both proponents and critics are only now grasping the significance of what is at stake.
As part of the “continuing resolution” to reopen the federal government, the Senate has passed a measure that, according to a Senate Appropriations Committee bill summary, “Prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving CBD and industrial hemp products.”
If approved by the House of Representatives later this week and then signed by the president, the measure would go into effect in 365 days.
“Everyone in the hemp industry knew the government would eventually close or tighten the loophole, but I think many felt that there would be some form of working with the industry to effectively regulate,” says Zack Kobrin, a Fort Lauderdale attorney with the firm of Saul Ewing who works in the hemp and cannabis industry.
“The reaction from many is that they are surprised it was such a sudden and sweeping measure. I think for those that are cowboys, they will just maximize on making as much as they can until they can’t. I think for those hemp operators that were trying to work with regulators and trying to follow the rules, this will be a real blow.”
 ‘Big Cannabis’
Carlos Hermida, who runs two hemp shops in the Tampa Bay area, alleges that the alcohol and cannabis industries were successful in getting Congress to enact the legislation.
“It’s abundantly clear that the American Distilled Spirits Alliance, Beer Institute, Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., Wine America, and Wine Institute — Big Alcohol combined with Big Cannabis, such as Trulieve & Curaleaf — have spent ridiculous amounts of money on lobbying to put tens of thousands of small business owners like myself out of the hemp industry for their own bottom line,” he said in a text message.
“The most un-American thing about all of this is the move towards total market control by a few rather than competition. Money in politics is destroying every aspect of commerce.”
Total sales from hemp businesses in Florida run in the billions of dollars, according to a 2023 analysis from Whitney Economics. That report said the industry employs approximately 104,000 workers earning in excess of $3.6 billion in annual wages.
That’s led in part to a growing rivalry between the hemp and cannabis industries in Florida that was exposed last year, after members of the hemp industry contributed financially to groups working to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in the state. A request for comment from Trulieve, the state’s biggest medical cannabis operator, was not returned.
When news of the proposal surfaced last month, Cornbread Hemp co-founder Jim Higdon urged Florida’s congressional delegation to defend Florida’s hemp economy.
“Florida’s hemp market supports thousands of jobs, from growers to beverage distributors,” he said in a press release on Oct. 6. “Banning hemp products would devastate that progress. We ask Florida’s congressional delegation to protect this legitimate, regulated industry that Floridians overwhelmingly support.”
Florida lawmakers passed a measure during the 2024 legislative session that would have banned the sale of Delta-8 and imposed regulations on other intoxicating hemp-derived products, a measure described by Kobrin at the time as “a massive blow to the industry.”
However, it was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Anti-drug organizations in Florida are hailing the vote in the U.S. Senate.
“I’m extremely excited that they’re closing the loophole, because this has been going on since 2018 when the farm bill was first passed and left this gaping loophole where these products came in under the radar, and they’re proliferating in gas stations, smoke shops, convenience stores, and now I’m seeing in Circle K, specifically the THC beverages,” says Ellen Snelling with the Hillsborough County Anti-Drug Alliance.
“They’re everywhere, and I feel like they’re trying to normalize this hemp-THC, all because of a loophole.”
Snelling remains concerned, though, because if even the measure is signed into law by President Trump, it won’t take effect for another year.
“That’s a long time, because we’re still seeing children and adults going to the emergency room after ingesting these products, so I would like to see the state address it because even though they have some regulations in Florida, I don’t think they’re strong enough, because I’m still seeing very high-THC products in gas stations and convenience stores,” she said.
While Florida has not restricted hemp-derived THC products, Delta-8 THC has been banned in 17 states and severely restricted in seven more, according to the National Cannabis Industry Association.
The Legislature returned to Tallahassee earlier this year to once again tackle the issue. Speaker of the House Daniel Perez created a “combined workgroup” on hemp consisting of 24 members from two separate committees chaired by Rep. Michelle Salzman, R-Escambia County, that convened during the first week of the 2025 legislative session.
Members concluded after meeting three times that they did not want to pass any legislation that would kill what has become a billion-dollar-plus industry in the state, but they also agreed they needed to implement more regulations on the product.
However, unlike the 2024 session, they failed to produce any final bill for consideration, as there were significant differences between the House and Senate versions.
A state bill on hemp in 2026?
Salzman weighed in on the federal legislation Tuesday.
“I’m encouraged to see the Senate include hemp-related language as this bill moves to the U.S. House,” Salzman wrote on X. “My focus has always been on commonsense safeguards that protect Americans while supporting responsible industry. This is another step in that ongoing conversation, and I look forward to continued collaboration as the process moves forward.”
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has conducted inspections of hemp retailers and manufacturers across the state this year to ensure compliance with child-protection standards for hemp products. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the pending federal legislation.
Last month, 38 attorneys general from both political parties sent a letter to the Senate and House appropriation chairs calling on Congress to clarify the 2018 U.S. farm bill’s definition of hemp “to ensure intoxicating THC products are taken off the market.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was not among them.
Kentucky U.S. Republican Sen. Rand Paul filed an amendment Monday to the continuing resolution package that would have stripped the hemp language, but it failed on a 76-24 vote.

(Photo courtesy of Consulate General of France in Atlanta)Before he sold furniture in South Carolina, Cecil Hart survived a German U-Boat attack and fought to liberate northern France during World War II.
For Hart’s service during the war, he received France’s highest honor in a ceremony earlier this year. Hart died Oct. 30, just over a month after receiving the medal, at 100 years old, said his son, Curtis Hart.
Originally from a cotton farm in Pacolet, a small town in Spartanburg County, Cecil Hart enlisted in the Army in 1943 as an ambulance driver.
“One day, he was working that farm, and the next day, he was in France,” his son, Curtis Hart, told the SC Daily Gazette on Tuesday.
Fighting in World War II
Growing up, all Curtis Hart knew about his father’s time in the war came from the military yearbooks his father kept. Although Hart asked his father questions about his service abroad, like many World War II veterans, he didn’t want to talk about it, Hart said.
That changed when Cecil Hart, in his 90s, went on an Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., his son said.
For years, Cecil Hart resisted a friend’s invitations to go on the trip because he didn’t like having too much attention on himself. Knowing how much Hart would get out of the trip, the friend finally told him, “You can go peacefully or another way,” Curtis Hart recalled.
During the several days Cecil Hart spent in D.C. with other veterans, he toured monuments and received thanks for his service. Cleaning out his father’s house over the past week, Curtis Hart found all the pamphlets and other memorabilia his father received on the trip, which was unusual for a man who didn’t much like clutter, he said.

“I think that was the first time in his life that he really realized what he’d been a part of,” Hart said.
After he came home, Cecil Hart began to talk a little more about his experiences during the war. But it was after he learned about the application for the Legion of Honor Medal that he really started to open up, Curtis Hart said.
“It brought back a lot of memories he had about the war,” Hart said. “Some were good, and some were not good.”
Curtis Hart thought many of his memories were better left forgotten, his son said. The veteran recalled having very little food to eat and seeing fellow soldiers suffering from illness and injuries.
At one point, Cecil Hart survived an attack from a German submarine that killed most of his division while crossing the English Channel, according to the Consulate General of France in Atlanta, which presented the award. He fought in northern France on D-Day, in an invasion that left an estimated 4,000 Allied troops dead, with more wounded or missing.
Hart left the Army in 1946, having earned the rank of private first class. He received a number of medals for his service, including a Good Conduct Medal, which recognizes excellent behavior and efficiency, according to the consulate.
Hart also received the WWII Victory Medal, which was given to all veterans who fought in the war; the American Theater Ribbon, given to soldiers in WWII who saw active combat or other dangerous conditions; and the European-African-Middle Eastern Theater Medal, for those who served in that area, with one Bronze Service Star, according to the consulate.
“We were very proud to be able to add a French Legion of Honor Medal to this list,” said Anne-Laure Desjonquères, the region’s consul general.
Even though his father often found it difficult to recount his experiences, Curtis Hart was grateful to learn more about his father. In the months leading up to the ceremony, the younger Hart listened to his father’s stories, taking notes so he would remember everything that happened.
To see his father recognized “meant a tremendous amount to us, mainly for his sake,” Hart said. “We were really happy for him.”
The Legion of Honor Medal
Cecil Hart’s daughter-in-law accepted the medal on his behalf during a Sept. 12 ceremony on Hilton Head Island because Hart, who died of congenital heart failure, was too sick to attend. The consulate tailors ceremonies to each veteran’s wishes, and Hart asked for a small recognition with friends and family, Desjonquères said.

The award, which Napoleon Bonaparte established in 1802, recognizes both French citizens and foreign nationals who contributed to France or upheld its ideals. For about 20 years, French officials have worked to track down World War II veterans who fought on French soil to recognize their part in ending the war, Desjonquères said.
“Our objective is to show that France doesn’t forget what it owes to the veterans who fought to liberate our country and Europe,” Desjonquères said.
Notable recipients of the award include Dwight Eisenhower, the World War II general and U.S. president; and Josephine Baker, the performer, World War II spy and Civil Rights Movement activist.
For the most part, the consulate hears about veterans through word of mouth, Desjonquères said.
In Hart’s case, Best Defense Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting military veterans, let the consulate know that Hart might be eligible for the award, she said.
A consulate employee reached out to Hart’s family and began processing an application for Hart to receive the award. Each application undergoes a vetting process to ensure the veteran really did fight in France, which is sometimes as simple as looking at discharge records and sometimes requires reviews of old photographs or first-person accounts, Desjonquères said.
When it comes to those who fought in World War II, the consulate works as quickly as possible, keeping in mind veterans’ advanced ages, she said.
An estimated 45,000 of the more than 16 million Americans who fought in the war were still alive going into 2025, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans.
Around 750 of those veterans live in South Carolina, the museum estimated.
Life after the war
Just as abruptly as Cecil Hart headed to France in 1943, he went straight back to work in South Carolina, Curtis Hart said.
For a while, Cecil Hart had a job hauling feed and seed in Spartanburg, his son said. There, he met his lifelong wife, then Betty Crosby, who walked past on her way to and from her office every day.  Hart was embarrassed every time he saw her because he was always dirty from the hard work, their son said. The two remained together for 63 years, until she died in 2009.
Eventually, Hart got a job selling furniture and dedicated the rest of his life to that career. He opened Stuckey Brothers & Hart Furniture in Beaufort with a friend in 1965, then gradually expanded to four stores in Spartanburg and Beaufort counties, Curtis Hart said.
“He was one of those guys that that was all he did,” said the son, who lives on Hilton Head Island. “He didn’t play golf. He didn’t have a hobby. The furniture store was his hobby.”
Even after Cecil Hart sold the stores so he could retire, he continued helping out at his son’s furniture store, his son said. He stayed remarkably healthy, living independently and regularly driving across the state even at the age of 100, Curtis Hart said. For all 70 years of his life, he received nothing but unconditional love from his parents, he said.
“I was very fortunate for him to be my dad,” Hart said. “We had an incredible relationship.”
Tantamount to all else in Cecil Hart’s life was his faith. Hart was an active member of multiple Baptist churches during his lifetime, most recently First Baptist Church of Hilton Head Island. He believed that if he lived a humble and helpful life, he would spent eternity in heaven, Curtis Hart said.
“We rejoice in that, that he’s in heaven today and we will see him again,” Hart said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/67EED0C9-972A-4F4F-8C93-F6B9216571D4remotecf7dd2842915fa92e754221ecde1ae8921811c86-1-original-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

But it wasn’t until the state legislative auditor, Michael Waguespack, informed the New Orleans City Council in October that the deficit was in the range of 160 million dollars that the degree of the crisis became clear.
To meet the city charter requirement of submitting a balanced budget by the end of the year, the City Council is currently negotiating a loan from state officials. The loan would be repaid over six months. As a condition of receiving the loan, the council will need to agree to greater financial oversight from the state.
In addition to acquiring the loan, the council is considering cost-cutting measures including layoffs, furloughs, and cuts to city services.
While it will be necessary to make structural changes in city government to eliminate waste and improve efficiency, too many cuts in vital services such as sanitation, police, and street maintenance will reduce the quality of life for residents.
If the city is to maintain basic services for its residents, it cannot cut its way out of a crisis. It needs to grow its way out of a crisis. The best way to reduce a budget deficit is to bring in new revenue. Since voters don’t trust the city government to manage the tax revenue they are receiving now, there is no chance the voters would agree to increased property tax or sales tax rates.
The only reliable way to increase tax revenue coming into the city coffers is to grow the economy and attract new business into the city. To avoid future deficits, the city will need to diversify its economy beyond the traditional reliance on tourism, hospitality and river port operations.

From a marketing perspective, if you want to dominate a market, you need to be the first, the best, or the biggest. It is even better to offer a product or service that is unique, or at least rare.
Many public officials talk about the need for economic diversification. But few give specific or concrete proposals. I’ll give one here.
Corporations conduct location analysis before considering moving to a new city. In addition to factors such as crime, schools, traffic, airline flights, and cultural resources, a major factor they analyze is vulnerability to disasters. Companies don’t want to put their employees and physical assets at risk.
While the flood control infrastructure has greatly improved since Katrina, New Orleans still gets low marks on vulnerability, and this hurts its competitiveness. New Orleans should not only have infrastructure to withstand the next hurricane, but flood control systems to guard against the common neighborhood flooding that still happens during a heavy thunderstorm.
The city has a large critical mass of civil and environmental engineers, hydrologists, urban planners, architects, and construction managers who are experts in flood control. They are spread out among private industry and university sectors. If given sufficient government authority, they have the knowledge to solve the flood control issues.
However, the key here is not only to solve the vulnerability problem to make the city a more attractive business location. The key is to also market and sell these solutions.
The example that New Orleans should follow is not Houston or Atlanta. It is Amsterdam. The capital city of the Netherlands is located below sea level and has a history of catastrophic flooding. However, over the last 50 years or so, Amsterdam turned this weakness into a strength and then a product and service to be sold.
Through specific green infrastructure strategies, (Amsterdam constructed more canals than Venice), the city’s engineering and construction firms solved their own flood control problems, then began strategically marketing these services to other cities and private industry.
Amsterdam, a city culturally similar to New Orleans in terms of tourism, hospitality, and port operations, created an entire niche industry around civil engineering and construction firms that specialize in flood control and coastal restoration. These firms employ tens of thousands of people and generate billions in revenue.
An incentive program to attract those types of firms to New Orleans, and hold the ones we have here, would help create a U.S. niche, capitalizing on unique expertise that we already possess locally.
This is one economic growth idea. There are many other innovative ideas floating around the city. The point is that we need to focus our energy on growing the total size of the pie, rather than only focusing on which pieces we should cut.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Most of New Jersey’s House delegation opposes the stopgap funding bill expected to come before them on Wednesday that would end the record-breaking federal government shutdown.
Seven of the state’s nine House Democrats said they will vote against the funding package, and another two have issued statements critical of it because it would not extend subsidies for health care plans bought on the individual marketplace. Premiums for those plans will rise 174% next year if the tax credits expire before 2026 as planned, state officials have said.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11), who was elected governor of New Jersey last week, on Sunday said the deal would force New Jerseyans to pay more for health care.
“Making this deal is malpractice — we have more than 9 million people in New Jersey who are counting on us to fight for them, and instead Washington is putting them in harm’s way. Not on my watch,” Sherrill said.
Democrats jockey to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress

It’s unclear whether Sherrill will travel to Washington, D.C., to cast a vote on the funding bill. The first in a series of votes to consider the measure is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. Senate approved it in a 60-40 vote on Monday.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) said it’s a “serious concern” that the bill does not include the extended subsidies, but he has not said whether he will vote against the measure. 
“If Congress fails to act, 4 million Americans will lose their health care because they just can’t afford their premiums. That’s unacceptable,” Gottheimer said Monday.
The other seven Democrats in New Jersey’s House delegation have said they will vote against the deal.
“All Americans deserve access to affordable, quality health care. Full stop. This deal doesn’t deliver the results that Americans are rightfully demanding and if it comes to the House, I will be a hard no,” Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) said Sunday.
Both of New Jersey’s senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, voted no on the measure Monday.

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)The Federal Communications Commission voted to roll back limits on how much companies can charge incarcerated people and their families for phone and video calls.
The 2-1 vote in late October reverses rate caps the FCC adopted last year under a 2023 law that allows the agency to set limits on prison phone and video call rates. Critics say the rates are kept high by limited competition among major providers such as Securus Technologies and ViaPath.
Under the new interim rules, phone calls will cost up to $0.11 per minute in large prisons and $0.18 per minute in the smallest jails. Video calls will cost up to $0.23 per minute in large facilities and as much as $0.41 in small ones.
Only three states — Florida, Kentucky and Oklahoma — currently have rates above the new rates, meaning most prison systems across the country are already below the previously adopted 2024 rate caps.
The new 2025 rates will take effect 120 days after being published in the Federal Register.

In June, the FCC had abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing the 2024 rate caps after receiving complaints from local sheriffs and prison telecom companies. Republican attorneys general from 14 states also filed a lawsuit last year challenging the commission’s authority to limit how much prisons and jails can charge for phone calls, arguing that the rules deprived correctional facilities of needed funding.
Republican Commissioners Brendan Carr and Olivia Trusty, both appointed by President Donald Trump, supported the rollback. Carr argued the previous caps limited facilities’ ability to recover safety and security costs, such as monitoring calls, leading some to scale back or eliminate calling services altogether. Trusty said the 2024 rules “did not always strike the right balance,” and cited “unintended consequences” like service disruptions in some facilities.
At least one small jail — in Baxter County, Arkansas — ended phone services earlier this year in protest of the lower rate caps.
Democratic Commissioner Anna Gomez, appointed by President Joe Biden, voted against the order and called it “indefensible.” She said the decision gives monopoly telecom providers “the authority to increase the costs for families to maintain critical connections with their loved ones in prison.”
New York becomes latest state to offer free phone calls in prisons

Advocates for incarcerated people condemned the vote.
“These changes are a betrayal of the families who entrusted the FCC to protect them from the notoriously predatory correctional telecom industry,” Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, said in a news release. Worth Rises is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.

Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The FCC’s latest decision comes months after New York joined California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons. Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026.
At least two states — Maryland and Missouri — considered legislation this year to make prison and jail calls more affordable. Maryland’s proposal to make calls free in state prisons did not pass, but Missouri enacted a law in August capping phone call rates at no more than 12 cents per minute in correctional centers.

(Photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Ever since serving on Governor Palin’s Mitigation Advisory Group back in 2007, almost twenty years ago, I’ve been engaged in the pressing challenge of addressing climate change. I knew back then as I watched the Mendenhall Glacier rapidly retreat, that climate change was very real and that the trajectory for devastating impacts only went in one direction. I also understood the steepness of the rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and how our capacity to flatten the curve rests with our ability to rapidly reduce emissions. While many countries have made much progress in transitioning to renewable energy and in increasing energy efficiency, the world is still barreling toward the warming threshold of 2.0-degrees Celsius that was set by 194 countries in the Paris Agreement. Sadly, Typhoon Halong is the latest devastating storm related to climate change in Alaska. It strikes at the heart of Alaska.
The present disaster is hard for Alaskans, and has me thinking again of ways we can forestall such tragedies. I’ve written before about how reducing methane emissions in the state is a way Alaskans can make a difference in the face of a global threat. The present disaster returns me to that hope.
As noted by an article in the Alaska Beacon, researchers recently completed a comprehensive climate impact study that looked specifically at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The article summarized the study’s findings: “Coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, sea-level rise, intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems – are combining with storm surges to dramatically transform the coastal area, damaging communities and the food resources that have sustained Yup’ik people for centuries.” The evacuation of some 1,500 residents of villages including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok confirm this tragic conclusion that climate change is disrupting life in an area that defines the essence and richness of village life in Alaska. It saddens me deeply. 
A 2021 marine heatwave triggered  the loss of 10 billion snow crabs and the closure of the once-lucrative Bering Sea crab fisheries. Now we know that warming seas are the culprit behind the crash of chum salmon on the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers. From the Yukon to Kodiak, from the Arctic to Ketchikan, Alaska’s coastal fisheries must now confront the dual threat of heat waves and ocean acidification.  
Knowing this on top of learning that village life in the entire Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is facing an existential threat makes me feel like Frodo in Lord of the Rings. Looking out at the devastation of war, Frodo laments being the ring bearer and says, “I wish it need not have happened in my time.” That’s exactly how I feel when staring down the painful reality of climate change in Alaska. In the movie, Gandalf replies, “So do I and so do all who live to see such times. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” 
Even though Alaska alone cannot solve the climate crisis and save Alaska’s Native villages, we can do one key thing in the time that is given to us. Alaska can make a big difference by addressing methane leaks. Methane, also known as natural gas waste, traps 80 times more heat than carbon-dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. It is also important because industrial emissions from Alaska’s oil and gas operations account for approximately 60 percent of Alaska’s total 2019 greenhouse emissions. Altogether, I take this to mean that even though Alaska’s total emission contribution may be small on the global scale, Alaska can still make a significant difference because we have plenty of methane. 
According to research done by a team of scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund and several U.S. universities, halving methane emissions by 2030 could slow the rate of global warming by more that 25 percent and start a path to prevent an additional .5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. Furthermore, according to the International Energy Agency, the oil and gas industry could eliminate around 70 percent of its methane emissions with existing and well-known technology. Taken all together this means that taking action on methane is not only hugely significant in addressing the climate crisis but eminently doable. 
By statute, the state considers any non-emergency release of oil and gas through venting or flaring in excess of one hour as potential “waste.” Consequently, we already have one key tool in the toolbox. Now would be the time for the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to take its statutory obligation seriously and begin reining in non-emergency flaring and venting of methane. Some people think that flaring methane doesn’t happen on the North Slope, but here’s a satellite image showing large volumes of methane flaring.

As I read about the disruption to Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, I am reminded that reducing methane emissions is what we could do with the time that is given us.

(Screenshot)The Washington-based anti-tax Club for Growth is trying again to turn up the pressure on Indiana’s Republican legislators to support a new round of congressional redistricting.
The organization announced Tuesday it would be airing a 30-second ad on TV network stations and Fox News in Indianapolis this week.
That is just ahead of lawmakers returning to the Statehouse on Nov. 18 for their annual Organization Day meeting — and the Dec. 1 start of a two-week redistricting debate amid uncertainty over whether enough Republican legislators support redrawing the maps they approved four years ago.
The new TV ad leads with news video about Gov. Mike Braun calling a special session for redistricting and mentions the redistricting action in the Democratic-led states of California, Illinois and Virginia.
It does not mention that President Donald Trump started the fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map to squeeze out more GOP-friendly districts ahead of the 2026 elections. The ad also doesn’t include Republican redistricting moves in Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina.
Supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine Indiana congressional districts favoring Republicans based on 2020 census data. The current split is 7-2 in favor of the GOP.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh
The Club for Growth ad urges viewers to call an Indiana Senate phone number and tell legislators to “stand with Trump, pass new maps now.”
The organization did not reply to a request from Indiana Capital Chronicle for an interview about its pro-redistricting ad, which follows a similar one about a month ago.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh told The Indianapolis Star that it had already spent more than $1 million to support Republican redistricting efforts across the country.
McIntosh said the group is “going to spend what it takes” to boost the current 7-2 Republican advantage in Indiana’s U.S. House delegation.
“Our message is, to the Republicans, man up and get in the game,” he told the Star.
McIntosh was an eastern Indiana congressman in the 1990s and was the unsuccessful 2000 Republican nominee for governor.
The Club for Growth inserted itself into Indiana politics in early 2023 by criticizing former Gov. Mitch Daniels as an insufficiently conservative “old guard Republican” as the organization sought to keep him from challenging then-U.S. Rep. Jim Banks for the 2024 GOP nomination for a U.S. Senate seat.
A group called Fair Maps Indiana, which has deep ties to Trump, launched this week what it called a six-figure advertising effort in favor of the redistricting push. That includes digital, cellphone, television and mail ads.
The pro-redistricting campaigns come as a recent statewide poll of 800 registered voters, 51% didn’t want redistricting now — with 45% “strongly” opposed. About 39% supported the prospect, but just 23% “strongly” backed it.
The poll was sponsored by the group Indiana Conservation Voters, which has led an anti-redistricting campaign since soon after the possibility emerged in August with Vice President JD Vance’s first of two trips to the state to push the issue.
Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, called the pro-redistricting campaigns the product of Washington consultants trying to stir up voter anger.
“People are fired up and they’re fired up about this redistricting scheme because they see it for what it is, which is cheating,” Robertson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “You got a bunch of guys from Washington, D.C., trying to bully our legislators and Hoosiers are telling them not to do it.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/11/budget-concerns-resurface-as-state-faces-projected-1-4-billion-gap-for-coming-year/,"Lawmakers will be briefed Wednesday on a $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session, roughly times larger than the amount predicted in April.","Legislative budget analysts are warning of a $1.4 billion budget gap for fiscal 2027, driven by federal economic policies, that is projected to grow to almost $4 billion over the next five years. (Chart courtesy Department of Legislative Services)Lawmakers will be briefed Wednesday on a $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session, roughly times larger than the amount predicted in April.
The briefing for House and Senate fiscal committees by the Department of Legislative Services blames the projected cash shortfall on national economic pressures, chiefly inflation and the rising costs of goods and services to state government as well as the ever-increasing costs of Medicaid. Additionally, the state is seeing other costs driven by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported goods.
The new comes after a 2025 legislative session where Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the General Assembly were able to close a $3.3 billion structural deficit through a combination of one-time fund transfers, tax increases and budget cuts. When they wrapped up the session in April, they expected the conversation over the fiscal 2027 budget would include a manageable $300 million structural deficit.
State fiscal leaders said the new numbers are clearly concerning, but they also caution that this is just the first in a series of economic forecasts before they have to settle on a fiscal 2027 budget.

“What they’re going to present tomorrow is sort of the worst-case scenario, literally at a point in time,” Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said in an interview.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said fiscal leaders are “sort of surprised, but we’re sort of not.”
“We did what we could do in Maryland to resolve this for fiscal ’27 but we don’t control the national climate, and we don’t control all the fiscal uncertainty that our nation, frankly, is facing,” Barnes said.
The numbers presented tomorrow are subject to change. The Board of Revenue Estimates will update its revenue forecasts in December and again in March.
“The whole thing is concerning — losing up to $1.5 billion in revenue based on the negative actions of a federal government,” Barnes said. “It’s not just concerning that we’ve lost the $1.5 billion. It’s pretty concerning that they’ve [the Trump administration] only been in office 10 months.
“I think it’s something we’re all just going to have to hedge and do our best and try to continue to protect the programs that get to people and help people and sustain us over these next few years,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) on Tuesday said Democrats were once again “blaming the Trump administration for Maryland’s growing fiscal disaster.”
“The truth is, this crisis was created here at home — by reckless spending, failed leadership and political posturing,” Hershey said. “Instead of confronting the state’s looming multibillion-dollar deficit, the governor is consumed with national politics and partisan redistricting schemes.”
The impact of the federal government shutdown, now in its seventh week, is not included in the briefing documents reviewed by Maryland Matters, and may not be fully known until the Board of Revenue Estimates releases a final estimate in March.
The new projections do account for the expected loss of state revenue due to an increase in the deduction for state and local taxes that was part of a signature tax package proposed by President Donald Trump and passed by a Republican-led Congress this summer.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A 2017 law passed during Trump’s first term set the deduction at $10,000, which benefited Maryland to the tune of about $300 million more each year.
The new deduction — $40,000 — erases that advantage. The Board of Revenue Estimates in September projected the state will lose $118 million in the current year as a result of the change, more than $71 million in fiscal 2027 and another $30 million the following year.
Revenues begin to tick up for three years starting in fiscal 2029, but nowhere near the amount to offset the $300 million annual gain under the 2017 law.
The Board of Revenue Estimates projected a small 1.7% increase in revenue for fiscal 2027. Weeks later the record-setting federal government shutdown began. The briefing documents also note that Maryland has lost more federal jobs this year because of federal workforce reductions than any other state.
The combination is causing many to be pessimistic about the Board of Revenue Estimates December update, the last revenue forecast before Moore delivers the budget to the legislature in January.
An ever-expanding decade-long set of K-12 education reforms, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, will exhaust a trust fund account that had been set up to fund the reforms. Those costs will drive billions in projected out year deficits. The program will then have to either be pared back or paid for using billions in general fund revenues or higher taxes.
One solution likely not on the table in an election year is a discussion of tax increases or other so-called “revenue enhancements.”
The state has a rainy day fund of roughly $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than the 5% required by law. The 73-page briefing report notes that lawmakers could reduce the deficit by using $815 million in rainy day funds, a one-time fix that does not resolve the gaps that grow over the next five years of the forecast.
But dipping into the fund brings its own share of concerns. First, there is a looming budget crunch forecast for post-election fiscal 2028, when the structural budget deficit is projected to be nearly $3.2 billion. It grows from there to nearly $3.5 billion in fiscal 2029 and roughly $4 billion in fiscal 2030 and 2031.
Additionally, there are constant concerns about how bond rating agencies will view tapping the fund.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Maryland boasted for more than 50 years about a triple-A bond rating from the three bond rating housed, but that changed this spring when Moody’s downgraded the state’s credit rating. Two other firms — Fitch and Standard & Poor’s — continued to give the state their highest rating. Both raised concerns about the costs of state government programs, including the Blueprint and pensions.
There are also concerns about the potential for a recession.
Mark Zandy, a national economist who has consulted with the General Assembly, listed Maryland among nearly two dozen states that are in danger of falling into recession if not already in one. That analysis was released prior to the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The report will also contain roughly $700 million in deficiency spending. The amount is spread over two years, fiscal 2025 and the current year. Barnes and Guzzone said higher than expected ending budget figures for fiscal 2025 coupled with a cash surplus will erase that gap.
“Generally, I am optimistic. I certainly know that we’ll figure it out,” Guzzone said. “Some of these things are out of our control. They will be what they will be, and we will work hard and figure it out, and we will have a balanced budget, and that I know.”

For 44-year-old Stephen Bryant to avoid the death chamber, he will need a federal court or the governor to intervene, both highly unlikely possibilities. His execution is scheduled to take place at 6 p.m. Friday.

Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to killing three people and shooting another during a string of 2004 burglaries primarily in Sumter County. In a last-ditch appeal in state court, Bryant’s attorneys argued his original attorneys did not present evidence that his mother’s heavy drinking while pregnant and childhood sexual abuse affected Bryant’s development.
Bryant’s attorneys argued that evidence may have been enough to change the sentencing judge’s mind in giving Bryant the death penalty for one of the three killings.
The state’s highest court disagreed.
Bryant’s original attorneys told the judge about the sexual abuse Bryant survived as a child, as well as his struggles in school and his history of addiction and other mental health issues, reads a Monday order signed by all five justices.
Experts testified that Bryant’s use of insecticide-sprayed marijuana and methamphetamines caused brain damage and that he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder during the time of his crimes. Questions about whether Bryant’s mother drank heavily during her pregnancy with him, hindering his development, came up during Bryant’s sentencing. However, his mother refused to tell even his attorneys whether that was true, according to the order.
Without cooperation from Bryant’s mother, testing for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder likely would have come back inconclusive. Even if Bryant did receive a diagnosis, it would do little to bolster his case, since other mental health issues likely impaired him in similar ways, the justices wrote.
The brutality in the killing that led to Bryant’s death sentence outweighed his state of mind at the time, the order reads.
“By any stretch, (Bryant) demonstrated a high level of planning, decision making, and calculation in the course of his eight-day spree,” the justices wrote.
During those eight days, Bryant broke into multiple homes, stealing guns and ammunition along with electronics and money. He shot a fisherman, Clinton Brown, in the back, though Brown survived. Bryant picked up two victims, Cliff Gainey and Chris Burgess, in his truck before shooting them and leaving their bodies by the side of the road. Bryant received life sentences for their murders.

In the middle of his crime spree, Bryant broke into the Sumter County home of 62-year-old Willard Tietjen and shot Tietjen to death. Bryant used Tietjen’s computer, smoked his cigars and cigarettes, and answered his phone to tell Tietjen’s wife and daughter he had killed Tietjen, according to court documents.
Police found Tietjen’s body with cigarette burns on it, including in his eyes. Bryant left notes written on the walls, including, “Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” with some letters written in blood, according to court records.
That was the crime that caused a judge to sentence Bryant to death.
Unless a higher court or the governor intervenes, Bryant will be the third person in the state put to death by firing squad since legislators added the option in 2021. He will be the seventh executed in the state since the process resumed in September 2024, following an unintended 13-year hiatus.











Nationwide, there have been 41 people executed so far in 2025, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

“Unexpected” pardon puts to rest what has become an ordeal in and out of the court over transgression in Grand Teton National Park. “IT’S FINALLY OVER,” Sunseri posts.
The post Trump pardons Grand Teton speed-runner Michelino Sunseri’s shortcutting offense appeared first on WyoFile .","The ordeal over Michelino Sunseri’s 2024 shortcut on the Grand Teton — which spurred a federal trial and garnered Congressional notice — came to an unexpected conclusion Monday when President Donald Trump pardoned the speed runner. 
It was an appropriately unexpected ending to an incident that snowballed into something Sunseri never could have imagined, he noted in a Monday Facebook post alongside images of the pardon.
“Seriously. You can’t make this stuff up,” he wrote. “It’s only fitting that something this absurd from the start ends in an equally surreal way.⁣”
Sunseri was attempting an out-and-back speed record on the 13,775-foot crown of the Teton Range on Labor Day 2024 when he cut a switchback,  opting to take what some call the “old climber’s trail” down the mountain. 
That choice proved hugely consequential. Because of it, the arbiter of alpine speed records, Fastest Known Time, refused to acknowledge Sunseri’s scorching 2:50:50 time as the new record. The trail transgression ignited a high-profile debate about alpine-sport ethics and what constitutes overcriminalization in national parks. Park rangers cited Sunseri, which led to a two-day trial in a federal courthouse in Jackson.

Sunseri’s legal team also did extensive advocacy to raise awareness of what they say are outsized penalties for federal misdemeanors. That included talks with Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who agreed that cases like Sunseri’s represent a problem of overcriminalization that Trump targeted in a May executive order. 
Those efforts resulted in Sunseri’s case landing on Trump’s radar, defense attorney Alex Rienzie said. Still, the pardon was unexpected, he said. 
“I feel happy for Michelino,” Rienzie said. “He can finally put this behind him and we can all move on to more productive pursuits.”
Sunseri echoed that sentiment. 
“I’m absolutely, incredibly grateful,” he said on Facebook. “But, it never should’ve gotten this far.⁣ This case was a massive waste of taxpayer money and government energy from the start — something that should’ve easily been resolved back in September 2024 when I offered community service to close the trail for good. Unfortunately, instead of working with me, the system tried to make an example of me.”
The shortcut felt around the world
During his speed attempt, Sunseri cut a switchback to avoid hikers on the designated route. He described his decision in a Strava report shortly after the feat, writing that “If I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.” 
Some previous record holders also had taken that shortcut, but Sunseri was the first to face formal consequences. Fastest Known Time rejected his submission due to the offense. Shortly after, Grand Teton National Park rangers cited him for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation carries a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail.
Grand Teton rangers have reportedly struggled for years to keep people off of the old climber’s trail, a faint singletrack with small signs near the top and bottom that read “short cutting causes erosion” and “closed for regrowth.”

Supporters of ultra runner Michelino Sunseri have created stickers, T-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino to protest what they say is an over-harsh penalty for his switchback-cutting infraction on the Grand Teton.

When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, a five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges. The penalties were too steep, he argued. That led to the May trial.
Meanwhile, the court of public opinion also weighed in. Sunseri supporters made T-shirts, stickers and social media posts accusing the National Park System of a heavy hand. Others, including Jackson Hole athletes, said Sunseri was setting a poor example of trail stewardship as a sponsored athlete.
Over the day-and-a-half trial, which unfolded in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson before Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick, eight witnesses took the stand. They included professional athletes and older climbers who had scaled the peak hundreds of times, park rangers and a trails management expert. 
A fitting punishment?
During the trial, attorneys zeroed in on the historic conversation around and use of the switchback-cutting route; the procedures by which park rangers discern whether a citation is appropriate; the private conversations Sunseri had regarding his route and the semantics around trails considered either “established,” “maintained” or “designated.” 
The lawyers’ arguments centered on whether the Park Service properly notified the public of the closure and fairly cited Sunseri.
In a September decision, Hambrick sided with the prosecution when she determined the trail closure was valid and the park properly communicated the closure, and thus Sunseri was guilty.
Sunseri’s team appealed that ruling, arguing the decision gives park superintendents power well beyond what the Constitution affords them. 
But on the eve of sentencing, Sunseri’s team struck a deal with newly appointed U.S. Attorney for Wyoming Darin Smith. The deal would dismiss the misdemeanor charge from Sunseri’s record if he completed community service and an educational class. 

In this photo posted on Rep. Harriet Hageman’s Instagram, the Wyoming congresswoman hugs Michelino Sunseri. They met to discuss his case, which Hageman says is a clear instance of overcriminalization. (Screenshot/Instagram) 
“U.S. Attorneys have discretion to make prosecutorial decisions based on what they feel is in the best interest of the public and the justice system, without consideration of outside influences,” read a statement Smith’s office sent to WyoFile in October. “This decision is not a rejection or criticism of the good work of the National Park Service, the Court, or the parties in this matter. It is an evolution of what is right and was made to preserve prosecutive and judicial resources while upholding the best interests of the public and the justice system.”
Hageman had previously voiced her opinion that agreed Sunseri’s proposed penalties did not match the crime. Along with Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, she penned a July letter to acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Sprecher stating that Sunseri’s “prosecution appears to be a prime example of the problem of overcriminalization.”
New routes
The pardon does not automatically trigger a reversal of FTK’s decision on the Grand speed record. It’s an independent arbiter that rejected the record before rangers issued a citation. 
For now, Andy Anderson still holds the men’s FKT record for the Grand Teton for his 2012 effort, when he ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles and 7,064 feet of elevation gain in 2:32:02. Jan Maus, meanwhile, broke the women’s record in August with a time of 3:45:34.
Fastest Known Time, however, has updated language on its Grand Teton entry page to emphasize what it calls the “Modern Route” up and down the mountain. The route, which both Anderson and Maus followed, does not use the old climber’s trail. 
“The Jenny Lake Rangers now prefer that runners stick to designated and maintained trails (where available), which aligns with this Modern Route,” the page reads. “FastestKnownTime indicated it will not accept future submissions using the Historical Route, though it remains an integral part of the mountain’s history and lore.”

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)A Utah judge’s late-night court order Monday sparked celebration from anti-gerrymandering groups and Democrats, striking down the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature’s congressional map and replacing it with one that would include a single Democratic-leaning district and three Republican-leaning districts. 
But Utah’s redistricting battle is far from over — and it may boil over into an even uglier clash with the state’s judiciary. 
Barely 20 minutes after 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s order was released, with her decision going public shortly before midnight, a GOP Utah lawmaker announced on social media that he would launch an effort to remove her from the bench. 
“I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution,” Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, posted on X. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Under Utah law, elected officials and judges can only be impeached for “high crimes and misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.” Any impeachment proceedings would be required to start in the House.
Gibson was appointed in 2018 by then-Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, and confirmed unanimously by the GOP-supermajority Utah Senate. At the time, on the Senate floor, Sen. Todd Weiler — chair of the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee — quipped lightheartedly that he was told “by one of the smarter attorneys I know (that) ‘if we didn’t confirm her we were all a bunch of idiots,’” and he said he agreed. 
It’s too soon to say whether MacPherson’s effort will gain enough traction to survive both the House and Senate — but what was clear Tuesday was the Utah Republican Party and its member legislators were furious with Gibson’s order, accusing her of violating the Utah Constitution, which they continue to argue clearly requires the Legislature to carry out redistricting duties. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz — didn’t go so far as to directly promise impeachment proceedings, but they issued a joint statement strongly condemning Gibson’s ruling. 
“Late last night, a single unelected judge set aside the Utah Constitution and the voice of Utah voters, selecting a map drawn behind closed doors by out-of-state advocacy groups,” Adams and Schultz said. “The process the judge chose denied the people of Utah a chance to see it, to weigh in, or to be heard. The judge disregarded the Constitution to select a clearly gerrymandered map. This is not fair to Utahns and is deeply disappointing.”
While they argue the map drawn by plaintiffs and chosen by the court was “clearly gerrymandered” to favor Democrats, Gibson in her order concluded from more than 1,000 pages of evidence and hours of public expert testimony that the Legislature’s map “is an extreme partisan outlier — more Republican than over 99% of expected maps drawn without political consideration.”

She also concluded that lawmakers’ retained expert drew the map with “partisan political data on display” in violation of a voter-approved law meant to protect against gerrymandering.
Schultz and Adams, however, argued “this isn’t how government should work.” 
“Our system depends on transparency, accountability, and respect for the roles defined in our Constitution,” they said. “Judges are meant to uphold the law as written, not rewrite it to serve political ends. Nothing in Utah’s Constitution gives the courts authority to impose maps designed by private groups.”
Redistricting, they added, “is not a courtroom exercise; it is a constitutional duty entrusted to the Legislature, the body directly elected and accountable to Utahns. When that process is overridden, it weakens the voice of every Utahn.”
“Utahns deserve leaders who will defend their voice, their Constitution, and the balance of powers that make our system work,” they added. “This moment calls for unity and resolve, to stand together, but firmly, in defense of the principles that make Utah strong and the Republic process we all depend on.”
Did the judge violate the constitution? No, she’s following it, plaintiffs say
Gibson’s ruling was largely based on a unanimous decision last year by the Utah Supreme Court that determined the Utah Legislature does not have unfettered power when it comes to changing “government reform” ballot initiatives. 
That ruling sent a yearslong anti-gerrymandering lawsuit against the state back to Gibson’s courtroom, with all five of the Utah Supreme Court’s justices ruling she “erred” when she initially dismissed the claim that Utah lawmakers had violated Utahns’ rights to alter and reform their government through a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4. 
That initiative, narrowly approved by voters in 2018, created an independent redistricting process meant to guard against partisan gerrymandering. 
Gibson’s Monday decision capped off a court-ordered process to “remedy” the state’s 2021 congressional map, which she voided as a result of an “unconstitutional process” after she ruled in August that Utah lawmakers overstepped when they undid Proposition 4. 
Utah Supreme Court hands big win to plaintiffs in anti-gerrymandering lawsuit

While multiple GOP legislators have accused Gibson of being an “activist judge” who is ignoring the Utah Constitution, the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit say those claims ignore the Utah Supreme Court’s legal precedent and attack Gibson without any basis. 
“Today is a day we should all be celebrating the vindication of the voters of Utah and the courage that courts show in the face of enormous political pressure,” said the plaintiffs’ attorney, David Reymann, during a news conference on the steps of the 3rd District Courthouse in Salt Lake City on Tuesday morning. 
“The whole reason the court was put in this position to try and put a new map in place is because the Legislature failed to do its job and enact a legally compliant map,” Reymann said. “Courts don’t do this by default. They do it when the Legislature doesn’t do its job.” 
Reymann said threats to impeach Gibson are “irresponsible and unfortunate,” adding that he hopes “they are merely the initial throes of disappointment” from lawmakers who are frustrated that they lost in court “and not something they would actually pursue as a form of political reprisal, because that would be damaging.” 
To accusations that Gibson is violating the Utah Constitution, Reymann said lawmakers have “just been proven repeatedly wrong about that.” 
“The court’s role is to interpret the Constitution and decide whether what the Legislature has done complies with it,” he said. “Just because they disagree with what she has ruled does not mean that she has violated the Constitution.”

What happens when the Legislature and judiciary clash?
Acknowledging that the courts rarely issue statements in the political arena — and that Gibson is not likely to publicly defend herself — Reymann, speaking for himself as a lawyer and not on behalf of the plaintiffs, said that if lawmakers pursue impeachment, Utah attorneys and other legal professionals would likely rise up in fervent opposition. 
“The Utah legal community as a whole, political stripes aside, is very protective of the independence of the judiciary. And if there is really an effort to retaliate against Judge Gibson, I think that the legal community as a whole will stand up and defend her full-throatedly,” he said. “And they should.”
“She is an unbelievably respected judge in the community,” he added of Gibson. “She has done a fantastic job in this case, whether you agree with her decision or not. She has done the role that the Constitution committed to her, and to suggest that she should be removed from office just because you don’t like politically the result that she has reached, I think is highly irresponsible.” 
Impeachments of judges are rare, but Utah wouldn’t be the first state to see an impeachment effort stemming from a redistricting ruling. In 2023, Wisconsin Republican lawmakers threatened to impeach a liberal Supreme Court Justice judge if she didn’t recuse herself from weighing in on a lawsuit over the state’s legislative maps, but they later backed off after a former justice advised them nothing she had done had risen to the level of corrupt conduct in office. 
Utah’s redistricting ruling catches Trump’s ire

President Donald Trump has also called for impeaching judges who have ruled against his administration. In 2018, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement pushing back against the president. 
“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said at the time, according to Politico. 
A spokesperson for the Utah courts did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders, Schultz and Adams, also did not immediately respond to a question sent to their offices asking whether they were supportive of the effort to impeach Gibson. 
It also wouldn’t be the first time the Utah Legislature has clashed with the Utah judiciary. Earlier this year during lawmakers’ 2025 general session, lawmakers proposed a suite of bills that legal professionals decried as attacks on the judiciary’s independence. 
Many of those bills later fizzled after Utah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant met privately with legislative leaders, but lawmakers did pass a bill stripping the Utah Supreme Court of its ability to choose its own chief justice and instead granting that power to the governor and the Senate. 
Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, later vetoed that bill — but after striking a deal with lawmakers, they revived it while limiting the state’s next chief justice’s term to one, eight-year term. 
Pressure on lieutenant governor to not comply
Shortly after the Monday night ruling, Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson posted on X that she would “comply with Judge Gibson’s order and immediately begin the process of implementing” the plaintiffs’ alternative map that the court ruled should be used for the 2026 elections instead of the Legislature’s map “unless otherwise ordered by an appeals court.” 
“There will likely be an emergency appeal,” Henderson said in another statement posted Tuesday morning, “but the process of finalizing new boundary details will take weeks of meticulous work on the part of state and county officials. Barring an appellate court ruling, we must begin without delay to ensure that everything is in place for candidate filing in January.”

“The people of Utah deserve an orderly and fair election,” Henderson continued, “and we will do everything in our power to administer one.” 
Henderson’s statement quickly sparked anger from conservative voices online, including from MacPherson, who replied to her post by writing: “Maybe sleep on this before making irrational, unconstitutional decisions. Remember your oath as well.” 
Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have indicated that they intend to continue fighting in court, with appeals to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
“The question that nobody knows this morning is whether they are going to try to prevent the map that the judge ordered to be put in place and the lieutenant governor said would be put in place … whether they will seek to disrupt that process,” Reymann said. 
But because the lieutenant governor’s office, which oversees the state’s elections, told the court Nov. 10 would be the latest possible date to set congressional boundaries for next year’s elections, it doesn’t appear likely that an appeal could successfully reverse Gibson’s decision in time for 2026. But that remains to be seen.

The 2028 elections, however, are a different matter. While the Legislature continues to fight in court, the Utah Republican Party and the group Utahns for Representative Government are also pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition 4. 
To qualify the repeal question for the 2026 ballot, the group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
That effort is currently underway. 
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the anti-gerrymandering group that successfully pursued Proposition 4 via ballot initiative eight years ago, said “we’re confident” that Utah voters will reject the effort to repeal. 
“We trust the voters of Utah, that they will choose fairness,” she said. “Of course, we have a fight ahead of us for next year. But right now, today, at least, we’re just celebrating this win.”

The public face of the agency has historically remained above the political fray, focusing on voting rules and routine business. That changed Saturday, Nov. 1, the final day of voting in the 2025 municipal elections.
The online portal voters use to look at their sample ballots wasn’t working that day. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton called out Republican state Auditor Dave Boliek, who was recently given a role in state elections.
The election board’s news release didn’t explain what happened to the portal, but castigated Clayton for spreading misinformation about the problem. It also praised state elections director Sam Hayes, and blamed the former director and Democratic leaders for not updating aging software. 
“It really struck me as odd,” said Greg Flynn, a Democrat and former member of the Wake County Board of Elections. “The partisan sniping was out of character.”
Jason Tyson, the state board’s new director of external affairs, said in an interview that the statement was an appropriate response to misinformation. 
Clayton said in her press release that the voter lookup outage had affected voting, which the elections staff denied. 
“The integrity of the Board and integrity of elections was put into question,” Tyson said. “That may have been why you saw a certain type of response.”
Tyson, who started his job in the elections office two days later, said he heard that “there was a lot of discussion” internally about the press release. “A lot of thought was put into how to respond to this type of misinformation,” he said. 
The press release was issued under state elections board spokesman Pat Gannon’s name. He is on paid leave, as Anderson Alerts first reported. Gannon has worked for the Board of Elections for more than nine years under state elections directors appointed by Democratic and Republican board majorities. Contacted last week, Gannon said he could not comment. 
For years, North Carolina elections administration under Democratic and Republican governors avoided the appearance of partisanship. That patina is now wearing away. 
Boliek, whom Republican legislators gave the power to appoint state board members and local board chairs, hired former state Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse as an elections liaison a few months ago. Boliek described one of Woodhouse’s duties as coordinating training for Republican board chairs.

The state board already conducts training for local elections officials. Boliek spokesman Randy Brechbiel couldn’t say last week how Woodhouse’s training sessions would differ from those the state provides. 
Republican legislators moved the state board into Boliek’s office, but under state law, elections oversight remains with the Board of Elections and its administrators. 
The change in party leadership at the agency also appears to have loosened the purse strings of Republican legislators. After years of giving the state elections board less money than requested, the legislature finally gave the elections board $15 million to complete the technology upgrades the former Democratic elections director sought for years.
They also included $1.2 million to allow Hayes, the new elections director, to hire staff exempt from the state Human Resources Act, meaning they can be political hires. 
Hayes explained at the time that he wanted staff not for partisan purposes, but to be able to build his own team. 
Tyson, who has worked for Republican executive officers, including former Gov. Pat McCrory and Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, is one of the new hires. 
Tim Hoegemeyer, a former Republican candidate for state auditor who last worked for the state Department of Public Instruction for nearly five years, is the board’s new general counsel. He replaces Paul Cox, who left to join the law firm Poyner Spruill.

Costs previously covered by the federal government will shift to states and poor families under the law, and some nursing homes will be forced to close while residents are rendered unhoused, industry leaders said. The law also rolls back a Biden-era rule calling for increased staffing in nursing facilities. In conjunction with the staffing cuts most nursing homes anticipate having to implement under the new budget constraints, industry leaders expect drastic repercussions for those served by and employed in nursing homes. 
“This law is really going to reshape the face of health care across the United States, including long-term care,” said Sam Brooks, director of public policy at Consumer Voice, a national nonpartisan advocacy group for long-term care. “We fought this bill tooth and nail and just really see this as an existential crisis for disabled and older folks.”
Lawmakers in favor of the law argue it doesn’t make cuts to Medicare – the federal insurance program primarily for elderly adults – but long-term care advocates argue nursing homes and residents will be harmed by these changes. Nationwide, the majority of nursing home residents use Medicaid – a fact that becomes more pronounced in Mississippi, the poorest state.
“Nursing homes rely heavily on Medicaid,” Brooks said. “You can’t cut a trillion dollars in Medicaid and not affect all Medicaid budgets … Nursing homes are not going to be over here siloed.”
Vulnerable adults in Mississippi stand to lose more, with 74% of the state’s nursing home residents on Medicaid, significantly higher than the national average, said Sylvia-Nicole Cecchi, project coordinator with the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program.
“Ultimately, these cuts could disrupt care for roughly 69,000 seniors and people with disabilities in Mississippi who rely on Medicaid,” Cecchi said. “When states are forced to cut nursing home reimbursement rates, studies show that the quality of care declines — residents face fewer staff, less attention, and poorer health outcomes.”
Home- and community-based care is also likely to be affected, though the bill doesn’t make direct cuts to the service, explained Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy manager who focuses on long-term care at KFF, a health care research nonprofit. 
“It’s a significant source of Medicaid spending,” Chidambaram said. “It’s also optional, so that’s a place states kind of have to look at first when federal spending is cut.”
The majority of long-term care Medicaid users receive care at home in the U.S. In Mississippi, roughly 3 in 5 Medicaid recipients access care this way, according to a KFF analysis.
Elderly adults will also be subject to subtle but significant enrollment changes to Medicaid and Medicare programs, such as an increase in paperwork. 
One such example is the reversal of a Biden-era policy that made it easier for people to enroll in and remain on what’s called the Medicare Savings Program. That program allows low-income Medicare beneficiaries to supplement their plan with Medicaid to bring down out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles and copayments. 
As a result of increased red tape, eligible beneficiaries are expected to get kicked off, denied or scared away from the savings program. Costs will increase for 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries who are not able to take advantage of the supplemental Medicaid coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. 
“A lot of what this law does is just adds paperwork for people,” said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. “There’s no reason to have an eligibility determination every six months for people that have no change in anything. These elderly residents are not getting new income.”
The law also changes Medicaid’s policy around retroactive coverage for nursing home residents from three months to two months. 
Retroactive Medicaid coverage for nursing home residents exists because going to a nursing home is not always planned. Sometimes an older adult will be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home after suffering a disabling condition, and oftentimes that person isn’t already on Medicaid. 
It might not seem like much, but paying out of pocket for one month in a nursing home can wipe out a person’s savings, Edelman explained. 
“The out of pocket costs for nursing homes these days are very, very high – $5,000 or $6,000 a month,” she said. “People just don’t have that kind of money – especially people who are eligible for Medicaid.”
Nursing homes are allowed to evict residents for unpaid bills, though it’s not clear how many evictions are wrongful – or how often unpaid bills are a result of a Medicaid enrollment error. The most frequent complaint against nursing homes is consistently related to evictions and transfers, according to the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center. 
An increase in enrollment errors, at a time when facilities are facing tighter budgets, could lead nursing homes to evict Medicaid-eligible seniors with unpaid bills. 
“One of the biggest drivers of involuntary discharge in nursing homes is unpaid bills,” Brooks said. “And oftentimes those bills are unpaid because of some Medicaid snafu – not getting the documents in, not applying on time.”
Nursing home facilities will suffer, too. Keeping residents housed while not getting reimbursed by Medicaid could force already-struggling homes to shutter. In Mississippi, there are 11 nursing homes at risk of closure, according to the United States Senate Committee on Finance in June. 
Leadership at the 11 nursing homes could not be reached by the time of publication.
The Mississippi Health Care Association, the state’s largest association of nursing homes, did not respond to a request for comment. 
“The destabilizing effect (the law) will have on nursing homes and their residents will leave these seniors in peril,” said Cecchi, of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program.

(Photo courtesy of the Polk County Assessor's Office)An Iowa distillery is suing the federal government for allegedly mishandling a permitting process and costing the company millions of dollars in lost revenue.
Red Boot Distillery of Des Moines, also known as JDSO Inc., is suing the United States of America, alleging employees of the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is an agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, negligently mishandled documents related to its permits to do business.
Red Boot Distillery holds federal distilled-spirits and winery permits issued by the bureau. On Dec. 21, 2019, the company submitted an application to the bureau, seeking to amend its distilled-spirits permit.  In January 2020, while that application was still pending, the company’s sole shareholder, Stuart Oxer, transferred his company stock into a revocable trust for estate-planning purposes, according to the lawsuit.
A month later, the bureau allegedly approved the permit amendment based in part on company records it had received detailing the transfer of Oxer’s shares to the trust, the lawsuit states.
Three years later, in December 2022, the bureau issued a formal “Notice of Potential Civil and Criminal Liability,” claiming the company’s permits had been automatically terminated due to an unreported change in company control — essentially arguing the distillery had not notified the bureau of Oxer’s transfers of his shares to the trust.
That move allegedly blocked the company from obtaining the required approvals for labels and formulas — and, the lawsuit claims, rendered the company “unable to serve existing customers or develop new alcoholic beverage customers.”
The lawsuit alleges the distillery was forced to suspend operations for several days and that, over the next two years, it “suffered substantial losses, including over $3.5 million in lost business and profits.”
The company claims it was forced to expend “significant financial resources” defending itself in at least two administrative proceedings commenced by the bureau. The proceedings were later withdrawn once it was discovered that the bureau’s own negligent acts had triggered the proceedings, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, seeks compensatory damages of no less than $3.5 million, as well as reimbursement for legal expenses.
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Red Boot, which calls itself Iowa’s largest beverage co-packing company, says it maintains 275,000 square feet dedicated to the bottling and canning of beverages, and manufactures flavored seltzers, health beverages, energy drinks, teas and lemonades.

More than 16,000 Heroes Memorialized on New Wall of Remembrance
NEW CASTLE, Del.  Today, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials joined with federal and state elected officials to commemorate the completion of the iconic Wall of Remembrance Memorial renovation project, located at Veterans Memorial Park adjacent to the Delaware Memorial Bridge.  The $5 million, multi-phase project, which began in June 2024, significantly expanded the wall to ensure every serviceman and servicewoman from Delaware and New Jersey who perished in wars and conflicts from World War II to the present day is now recognized. Previously, the War Memorial Wall contained only the names of those who served in World War II and the Korean War.
 
“Today marks the fulfillment of a promise to every Gold Star family in Delaware and New Jersey,” said DRBA Executive Director Joel Coppadge. ” The Wall of Remembrance now bears the names of every Delawarean and New Jerseyan who perished in wars and conflicts from World War II to the present day.  Every name added is a reminder of the price of freedom and a personal story of courage. It’s important that the full measure of sacrifice by our states’ bravest men and women is recognized, visible, and never forgotten.”
“To every Delawarean who raised their hand for our country, and every family who stood beside them, the Wall of Remembrance is a promise that we will never forget those who served and sacrificed for our freedom,” Governor Matt Meyer said. “As we continue strengthening veterans’ services across our state, this newly restored memorial stands as a place of reflection, respect, and gratitude for generations to come.”
“The Wall of Remembrance both honors those who gave everything and reminds each of us of the enduring responsibility that sacrifice places upon us. It is both a tribute and a teaching,” said U.S. Senator Chris Coons. “This restoration ensures that their memory, and the values they fought for, will continue to inspire future generations to serve, lead, and build a more just and peaceful world.”
“For seven decades, the Wall of Remembrance has paid homage to the brave men and women who gave their lives to protect our freedom,” said U.S. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Each of the names on this wall, including the newly added servicemen and women from more recent wars, made the ultimate sacrifice. May their names inspire us to create the more perfect union they gave their lives to protect.”
“Each name etched into this wall tells the story of a life defined by courage, duty, and love of country,” said Rep. Sarah McBride. “We owe these Delawareans and New Jerseyans more than remembrance — we owe them a nation worthy of their sacrifice. On this Veterans Day, may we honor their service not only in words, but in our shared work to preserve the freedom and democracy they gave everything to defend.”
The following DRBA veterans participated in the ceremonial raising of the six service branch flags:  Robert L. Arnold, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); Michael T. Casey, U.S. Air Force (Vietnam Veteran); Edward R. Cole, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); Curtis V. Esposito, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); David Wayne Hearn, U.S. Navy; and Kenneth R. Overton, U.S. Navy
The centerpiece of the renovation is the newly completed Wall of Remembrance, which has been significantly expanded to display more than 16,000 names from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf Wars, and subsequent operations in the Middle East, including Freedom’s Sentinel, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, and Inherent Resolve. Approximately 1,800 new names have been added to the memorial.
Key components of comprehensive rehabilitation include:

Expansion of the Wall of Remembrance: The monument’s display capacity was expanded to include fallen service members from subsequent wars and conflicts, with new metal plaques listing their names.
Structural Integrity: The underlying concrete structure of the original 1955 monument was replaced, expanded and reinforced to protect against the deteriorating effects of weather.
Enhanced Design: The project reintroduced the original circular plaza design, increasing the plaza and lawn area for better public access and programming.
New Features: The reflecting pool was removed to accommodate more programming space, all existing flagpoles were replaced, and a new one was added to honor the sixth branch of our armed forces, the U.S. Space Force.

Originally constructed in 1955, the War Memorial Monument, now known as the Wall of Remembrance, paid tribute to soldiers from New Jersey and Delaware who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country in World War II and the Korean War. Both the Delaware Memorial Bridge and Veterans Memorial Park are forever linked in history – dedicated five years apart from each other to honor our nation’s war sacrifices in World War II and the Korean War. The Park was dedicated on October 20, 1956.
In 1996, the monument grounds were modified from the original circular form to its current octagonal form, to add the service branch flags, and to include a new reflecting pool.
In 2024, the DRBA awarded Contract DMB 21-11 for the War Memorial Rehabilitation Project to Wickersham Construction and Engineering, Inc. of Lancaster, PA. The estimated cost is nearly $5 million to replace the underlying concrete structure, expand the Memorial Wall and Plaza, upgrade lighting, drainage, and landscaping. Construction activity was substantially completed in October 2025.

The department, referred to as DDVA, formalizes and elevates functions long handled by the state’s Office of Veteran Services and related agencies.






WILMINGTON, Del. — Retired Brig. Gen. Karen Berry is stepping into a new role at the center of Delaware’s veterans network as the first director of the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs, a new cabinet-level department created to elevate how the state supports those who served.
Berry outlined her responsibilities and vision on Monday, November 1o,  on A Better Discussion, a webcast hosted by former Attorney General M. Jane Brady for A Better Delaware, a nonpartisan public policy advocacy group.
The department, referred to as DDVA, formalizes and elevates functions long handled by the state’s Office of Veteran Services and related agencies.
“It’ll come across typically as DDVA… Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs,” Berry said. “Me being in this position just really amplifies that office, the hard work that that office and our commissioners… and our cemetery staff [are doing]. I can help organize them and help us network with other state agencies so that we can fully support our veterans.”
A cabinet seat for veterans
The new department was created following unanimous legislative support.
“It was 100% supported in the House and the Senate,” Berry said. She added that Delaware’s political leaders have shown consistent unity on veterans’ issues. “Whatever your political affiliation is, everyone comes together… and is very supportive of anyone serving… and for veterans.”
Brady said lifting veterans’ affairs to cabinet status was intentional.
“The entire effort was really focused on elevating our obligation to support our veterans to the cabinet level,” Brady said on the program. “Like education, like labor, that’s important to us.”
As a cabinet secretary, Berry will join regular meetings with other top state officials, giving veterans a voice in broader decisions on employment, training, health care, housing, and social services.
“Being in that room with the other cabinet secretaries will help [her] in coordinating employment opportunities, training… and redirecting from the jobs they had in the military to civilian service,” Brady noted.
Berry said that access is critical.
“I can help bring [agencies] together and make sure that we increase awareness and help [veterans] get access to the services that they earned when they served,” she said.
What the new department oversees
Berry’s portfolio brings multiple existing programs and responsibilities under one accountable leader:


Delaware’s state veterans cemeteries in Bear and Millsboro.


The Delaware Veterans Home in Milford, established under Gov. Ruth Ann Minner.


The Office of Veteran Services, including veteran service officers who assist with benefits, claims and casework.


The Veterans Trust Fund, which provides emergency financial assistance.


“We have seen a great deal this year [of veterans] who don’t have anywhere to turn, they’re having financial difficulties,” Berry said. “We have a Veterans Trust Fund that… can give them some financial support to help them get through some rough points, and also direct them to other resources.”
Berry also oversees a 12-member commission representing veteran service organizations across the state. Her job, she said, is to strengthen coordination among those groups and state agencies, and to build a small core staff focused on outreach, constituent services and legislative work.
“I know I need a constituent [services person], I need someone to help with constituent issues and legislative issues,” she said. Over her first five weeks, she has been visiting other departments to study how they are structured. “It helps me… see what their departments look like, and how I might shape mine to be best supportive.”
Budget and staffing will grow gradually, she said, but the mandate is clear: make sure veterans are not left navigating the system alone.
Bringing national experience home
Berry’s credibility in the role is grounded in a nearly 37-year military career and a lifetime in Delaware.
Raised in the Stanton-Newport area, she attended local schools and graduated from Delcastle Technical High School before enrolling at the University of Delaware. She joined the Delaware National Guard as a college student, later commissioning through Army ROTC and remaining in the Guard for most of her career.
She served as an engineer officer before moving into the Signal Corps.
“I was a communications officer for the majority of my career,” Berry said.
Berry deployed with a U.S. Army Reserve unit to Afghanistan, where she helped run theater-wide communications.
“I was in charge of the communications network in the entire theater of Afghanistan,” she said.
Her Guard service ran alongside a civilian career as a high school math teacher at Sussex Central High School, where both of her children were students.
“I was a high school math teacher for the majority of my career,” she said.
Military service runs deep in her family. Her husband, retired Adjutant General Mike Berry, served in the Delaware National Guard and spent 28 years as a Delaware state trooper. Her son and brother also served and deployed, and earlier generations fought in World War I, World War II and Vietnam. That history, she said, shapes her commitment to today’s veterans, including those who came home to too little thanks.
“We did not treat [Vietnam veterans] right, but I do think we’ve done much better recently, and that’s one of the things that I will continue in this role,” she said.
Coordination, best practices, and community partners
Berry said one of the strengths of the new department is its formal connection to a national network of state veterans agencies.
“We have a national association… so we meet twice a year to talk about national-level issues, share best practices,” she said. “That’s a great resource for me… so that I’m not trying to just recreate things from scratch.”
In Delaware, she highlighted partnerships with organizations, including Friends of Delaware Veterans and the National Association of Black Veterans, which raise money for the Veterans Trust Fund and support local programs.
“They really do an amazing job of networking with big corporations… and they’ve been doing a lot of really good work for veterans across the state,” Berry said.
Her first Veterans Day period in office reflected the visibility and expectations of the new role: events at Delaware Tech, ceremonies at the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and a major gathering in Kent County that draws veteran service organizations from across the region.
Through it all, Berry said her goal is simple but urgent.
“We increase awareness and help them get access to the services that they earned when they served,” she said. “Having this department and this seat at the table helps us do that.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/karen-Berry.jpg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation say FEMA continues to fail to compensate those who lost their primary residences in the fire. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation say the office overseeing $5.45 billion in compensation funds for victims of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire continues to delay payments and put up unnecessary barriers, particularly for people who lost their homes. 
The Nov. 6 letter from U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, along with U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, calls on the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office to account for reports from fire victims that the office is breaking promises about the pace of compensation and refusing to reopen claims from people who suffered new losses from the 2022 wildfire. 
FEMA and Claims Office officials did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry about the letter on Tuesday, which is a federal holiday. 
“We understand that many of these cases are complex and require detailed review by the office,” the members, all Democrats, wrote in the letter. “But it is unacceptable that these people who have suffered so much haven’t been paid three and a half years after the catastrophe.”
Congress awarded the Federal Emergency Management Agency $5.45 billion in a series of bills beginning in late 2022 aimed to “fully compensate” victims of the 534-square-mile wildfire in Northern New Mexico that was the result of two botched prescribed burns the United States Forest Service conducted. According to the office, it has so far paid out a little more than $3 billion of that.
Around this time last year, the office reported it had fully paid one-third of the 272 claims it received from people who reported total losses of their primary residences in the fire, and that approximately another third of them had gotten partial payments. 
According to the Nov. 6 letter, claims office officials promised the delegation it would pay the remainder by March of this year, but “nearly seven months later, several total loss claimants still await payment,” the members wrote. 
FEMA has paid out just 2% of fund to help wildfire victims rebuild. Some can’t wait much longer.

The letter calls on FEMA officials to report how many total loss claims remain outstanding and what their plan is to close the claims fairly and quickly. 
The letter also says fire victims have reported repeated denials for new claims of damage. Because the fire burned at high intensity in certain areas, the burn scar and areas downstream continue to be vulnerable to post-fire flooding and debris flows, including as recently as this summer. 
Claims office guidelines require the office to consider compensation for those “cascading events” that directly result from the fire, but the letter says that isn’t happening.
“We are alarmed that many community members have reported that the Claims Office has refused to reopen their claims to account for cascading events,” according to the letter. “That is inexplicable.”
The Nov. 6 letter marks the latest outcry from the delegation, which has repeatedly criticized the office for delays. It also calls on FEMA to answer for why it has not met legal requirements for reporting on its spending to Congress.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hermits-Peak-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

Steve Daines: We participated in the No Kings Protest on Oct. 18 in downtown Billings. More than three thousand Montanans, your constituents, joined us in Billings. We were united with over 7 million protesters who participated in No Kings events across the country, the largest single-day protest in our nation’s history. Before the protest even occurred, you called it a “We Hate America Rally” in an interview on Fox News. Nothing could be further from the truth. We protested because we love America!
Many people shared many opinions at the protests and we do not endorse all of the views expressed. However, the unifying theme was concern about the overreach of the executive branch of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump and Congress’s failure to check the executive branch.
Protest against abuse of power by the executive first united the 13 colonies as one people in defiance of King George III of England. Our national identity was first expressed by our founding fathers who signed the Declaration of Independence – primarily a list of abuses of power by the English monarch.
To protest abuse of government power is to be American. To accept abuse of government power against the people or for enrichment of government officials is to be un-American.
Many Montanans are concerned by the behaviors of President Trump and his executive branch. We observe a pattern of disregard for the rule of law and the constitution of the United States that, if unchecked, will have grave consequences for our nation and its people. While the President has the right to exercise the powers vested in him by the people as established in the constitution, the taking of additional powers from the people and from the other branches of government and the states exceeds his mandate. These include detention of American citizens without trial, infringement on Congress’ exclusive power to appropriate funds, the deployment of the military in American cities, the receipt of unconstitutional gifts from foreign powers for the personal benefit of the President, and Donald Trump’s public desire for an unconstitutional third term in office.
We declare that it is our shared and indivisible commitment to democracy and the rule of law, not conservative or liberal policies or the successes of individual leaders, that has made America succeed. We declare that no man is above the law. Our democracy, based on participation, compromise, and trust in each other, built a nation able to defeat fascism and violent nationalism in the second world war; a nation that has provided opportunity and freedom for hundreds of millions of Americans and others – something we should all celebrate.
Because we love America, we feel we must stand up, unite, and speak out against the erosion of our democracy and our constitution.
We invite all Americans to join us in speaking up for democracy and the constitution which both establishes and limits government power.
We hope you now see that we, your constituents, love America enough to speak up when she is threatened and we hope you will do the same.

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)Meghan Reckling, a Michigan Senate staffer who also co-founded the Republican Victory Field Operations, has resigned from her post in the office of state Sen. Lana Thies (R-Brighton), a move that followed another Senate staffer’s shuffle to the House over fallout involving their outside consulting work.
Reckling left her job acting as chief of staff for Theis following the Senate Business Office giving her an ultimatum of resigning from the Senate or keeping her connection to Victory Field Operations, The Detroit News reported on Tuesday. Reckling told the newspaper that she chose to resign.
The Senate Business Office is run by the office of Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids). Rosie Jones, spokesperson for Brinks, said the Senate does not discuss personnel matters and could not confirm whether Reckling resigned or not.
Reckling founded Victory Field Operations along with Jeff Wiggins, who worked in the office of Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt as his press secretary until Monday, when it was announced that Wiggins was moving to the office of House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township).
The moves follow the Michigan Advance reporting in October that Wiggins and Victory Field Operations were working for U.S. Rep. John James’ gubernatorial campaign. Nesbitt is also a candidate for governor and James is one of Nesbitt’s top rivals in the Republican gubernatorial hunt.
Nesbitt staffer’s firm works for James campaign, raising ethics flags in GOP governor race

At least two well-connected Michigan political operatives told the Advance in a previous story that the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
The Advance learned in October through public campaign finance data that Victory Field Operations was paid by James, not just for ballot access work but also political consulting via Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James.
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family.

Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.

The Detroit News reported Tuesday that Nesbitt also paid Victory Field Operations for political consulting, muddying the waters even more.

Michigan Senate leader’s press secretary moving to House speaker’s office

Reckling also told the newspaper that she and Wiggins had been previously approved to do work with Victory Field Operations outside the halls of the Senate.
Michigan Senate rules allow for outside work by employees but it was not encouraged, and certainly not for large scale political work.
But that changed following the Advance’s report on Wiggins’ work with Victory Field Operations while he was key Nesbitt staffer. The Detroit News reported that Reckling said Brinks was “unhappy” with her work with the firm she founded and that it was growing more political.
Reckling is one of Michigan’s foremost conservative voices on social media, routinely commenting on statements made by candidates and other politicos, news stories or the political headwinds of the day.
Nesbitt in a statement to The Detroit News said the Senate Business Office’s actions amounted to a political witch hunt.

John Grady and his wife Kara opened up their hemp emporium in Rosebud on July 4 — and they say about 60% of their customers are veterans, like Grady, who are treating chronic pain or PTSD with intoxicating hemp products.
Last night, they watched the U.S. Senate vote to approve a spending package to end a record-breaking federal government shutdown. But what drew their attention was a provision tucked in the bill that would prohibit hemp products from having more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container. If the House approves it and the president signs it, the prohibition will go into effect in one year.  
The change, Grady said, will devastate his business. 
“When this is done,” he said, “we’ll lose 52% of our revenue, meaning we won’t be able to stay in business.” 
On Tuesday – a day they would normally be focused on honoring veterans – the couple said they didn’t have the energy. 
“You’re sick to your stomach all day long,” said Kara Grady, “knowing your hard work is for not.”
State officials estimated last year that 40,000 food establishments and smoke shops and 1,800 food manufacturers were selling products that would be banned under the proposed federal regulations. 
That estimate was part of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ 2025 budget estimate to enforce former Gov. Mike Parson’s abandoned 2024 order that would have banned intoxicating hemp products in the state.
Hemp was legalized in the 2018 Farm bill and naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. 
But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products are completely unregulated by any governmental agency. 
There’s no state or federal law saying teenagers or children can’t buy them or stores can’t sell them to minors. However, some stores and vendors in Missouri have taken it upon themselves to impose age restrictions of 21 and up.
John Grady, owner of Slappyhappy Hemp Company, has owned a hemp farm in Missouri since 2023 and last year opened a hemp emporium in Rosebud (Photo submitted).
Missouri state Rep. Dave Himan, a Republican from O’Fallon, said he was planning on pre-filing legislation on Dec. 1 that would have established a licensing system to allow Missouri businesses to sell the low-dose hemp-derived THC beverages and edibles. 
If the federal spending bill passes, his bill will reflect the .4 milligram limit of THC per package – and that also includes THC-A, which transforms into THC when heated.
“We are really kind of looking now to see what the federal government’s going to do,” he said, “and if we need to make adjustments in my bill to mirror what the federal government’s going to put in place.”
This will be Hinman’s second year — and Missouri’s fourth year – trying to regulate intoxicating hemp products. Previous attempts failed because the proposed bills, backed by the marijuana industry, would have banned the products. 
Last year, several bills failed to advance because the hemp industry itself couldn’t agree on provisions for things including THC limits and licensing requirements. 
A report released last month by the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, which represents the marijuana industry, tested 55 intoxicating hemp products purchased from smoke shops and gas stations statewide. Results showed that nearly all of them were above the total THC limit that’s outlined in the pending federal spending bill.
While the debate in previous years has often been seen as a marijuana industry versus the hemp industry, both of those players have a growing common foe – the black-market marijuana products that are posing as certified hemp products, Hinman said. 
“There are some great people out there that own mom-and-pop shops that really are doing the right thing,” Hinman said. 
However, just last week, Hinman met with a group that brought in packages of about 40 different THC products purchased throughout the state that resemble Skittles, M&M’s and chips that would easily be mistaken by children as regular products. 
“That continues to proliferate throughout our state,” he said, “and it’s just getting worse and worse. So we’ve got to do something. And it’s actually not even hemp, it’s truly marijuana out there, and it’s really hurting the business.”
Eapen Thampy, a lobbyist who represents several hemp businesses, agreed that the “bad actors” have expanded and pose a threat to legitimate hemp businesses.
“We’re under attack from the marijuana industry that wants to protect their monopoly,” Thampy said, “and we’re under attack from bad actors who don’t care who they hurt to make a buck. We’re sort of the collateral damage in that picture.”
Thampy said the hemp industry is hopeful that Congress will take up the issue before the ban is implemented in a year, if the spending bill is approved. However, a Senate amendment to remove the language was defeated last night by a 76-24 vote, making the success of a separate bill unlikely.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s lone member of death row renews an attempt to overturn his death sentence at the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the American Civil Liberties Union is jumping in to help. 
In a “friend-of-the-court” brief filed Oct. 30, lawyers for the state and national ACLU argue that Michael Addison’s death sentence was affected by racial bias, given that similar murders in the state committed by white people resulted in life imprisonments.
A jury handed Addison, who is Black, a death sentence in 2008 after he shot and killed Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in 2006 while fleeing. Briggs had been responding to a reported domestic disturbance; Addison shot him in the head.  
But the ACLU has pointed to two other murders in New Hampshire in which the courts found a stronger intent to kill, and in which a jury sentenced the defendant to life in prison. In one 2006 case, John Brooks was convicted of murdering a handyman with a pair of accomplices after planning the killing for two years. And in 1998, Gordon Perry received a life sentence despite shooting and killing a police officer who was approaching his parked car. Both defendants in those cases were white. 
“One cannot hand wave these racial disparities,” the ACLU brief reads, adding that a proper proportionality review of a death sentence should consider whether the sentence is “arbitrary or infected by impermissible considerations such as race.”
The brief cites studies in other states suggesting racial disparities in the use of the death penalty. One 2014 study, from the state of Washington, found that Black defendants were 4½ times more likely than white defendants to be sentenced to death after being convicted of similar crimes. 
The amici curiae brief is a collaboration of the ACLU of New Hampshire as well as the national ACLU’s Capital Punishment Project. And it comes as lawyers for Addison are hoping to use New Hampshire’s death penalty repeal in his favor. 
The New Hampshire Legislature repealed its capital punishment law in 2019, narrowly overturning a veto by Gov. Chris Sununu. 
That repeal bill was intended to be forward-looking and to not apply to death sentences in the past, including Addison’s. It states that it “shall apply to persons convicted of capital murder on or after the effective date of this act.”
But this year, Addison’s attorneys have argued that despite the prospective language, the 2019 repeal should lead the Supreme Court to negate Addison’s 2008 death sentence. Executing Addison now would be “excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,” since someone convicted of the same crime today would not receive the death penalty, Addison’s attorneys argue. 
Under New Hampshire’s now-repealed capital murder law, the state Supreme Court may overturn a sentencing if that “excessive and disproportionate” standard is met. 
In making their argument, Addison’s attorneys are drawing in part on precedents set in Connecticut and New Mexico. In both states, lawmakers repealed a death penalty and attempted to make that repeal apply only to future capital punishment convictions, and in both states, their highest courts ruled the repeal rendered moot existing death penalty sentences. 
In its amici brief, the ACLU makes similar arguments, and provides research indicating that no state has carried out executions after its Legislature repealed the death penalty. If the state Supreme Court permits the execution despite the repeal, New Hampshire would be the first, they argue. 
The state Supreme Court has twice considered and denied appeals of Addison’s case on the basis of disproportionality — first in 2013 and again in 2015. In both instances, the court determined that Addison’s sentence was “neither excessive nor disproportionate,” after comparing it to 10 similar cases from four states with similar death penalty laws.
But Addison’s attorneys argue the 2019 repeal signaled “a profound shift in community values against the death penalty,” and that the court should thus revisit the disproportionality argument. 
In September, the Supreme Court said it would accept written briefs from both Addison and the Attorney General’s Office on the question of whether the 2019 repeal should negate Addison’s execution. 
Addison’s attorneys, Jonathan Cohen of Cohen and Winters, PLLC in Concord, and Michael Wiseman and Jon Cioschi, of Wiseman, Schwartz, Cioschi & Trama in Philadelphia, submitted their 27-page brief on Oct. 30.
The Attorney General’s Office has not yet submitted a response brief. But Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who as attorney general led the prosecution of Addison from 2006 to 2008, has spoken out strongly against Addison’s appeal efforts.
“Addison, a career criminal, murdered Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in cold blood, and he should face the death sentence imposed by a jury of his peers and upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court,” Ayotte said in a statement. “Commuting his sentence would be a grave injustice and an insult to Officer Briggs’ family and law enforcement.”
Some Republican lawmakers have filed bills ahead of the 2026 legislative session to restore the state’s death penalty laws. Ayotte has said she would support the return of the punishment to the state.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aclusign-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

In an Oct. 10, 2025, hearing  of Kansas Legislature committee, he argues for county authority to set administrative fees. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s auditors reported that Johnson, Labette and Gove counties spent $28.8 million to provide three state-mandated government services last year, but received one-third of that total in state, federal or user-fee funding to cover those administrative costs.
The three counties were selected for the audit because they represented a range of populations, geographic locations and spending per capita among Kansas’ 105 counties. Under state law, auditors said, Kansas counties provided 18 distinct core services. The limited audit examined costs during the 2024 fiscal year for the three counties in terms of services for criminal prosecution, motor vehicle registration and the collection of ad valorem taxes.
“The state requires counties to perform a lot of different services,” said Andy Brienzo, the supervising auditor who presented the report Monday to the Joint Legislative Post Audit Committee.
He said auditors estimated it would cost the state $19.1 million to compensate the three counties for compliance with minimum levels of service outlined in state law for the three areas reviewed.
The analysis was requested by Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal who chairs the audit committee, and Rep. Adam Smith, a Weskan Republican who chairs the House Appropriations Committee.
“I’ve always struggled with this,” Francis said. “I understand that the state does need to step up in this area.”
The Kansas Association of Counties estimated more than half of counties’ annual spending relates to providing services required by state law.
Johnson County had 632,000 residents in 2024, while Labette County in southeast Kansas contained 19,600 people, and Gove County had 2,600 residents.
 
Outdated model
Thomas Franzen, treasurer in Johnson County, said the majority of revenue collected by county treasurers in Kansas was passed to the state government. The audit, he said, revealed differences among Kansas counties in terms of administrative costs and levels of services provided. This reality was most evident in the administration of motor vehicle services, he said.
“Labor is the largest cost component to providing the services, and labor markets are different across the state,” Franzen said. “These differences lead to significantly different cost structures across 105 counties providing these services.”
He said Kansas’ standard county service fee structure made sense when the Kansas Department of Revenue performed a significant portion of administrative work tied to motor vehicle services. The fixed-fee structure has been flawed since 2012, when many of these responsibilities were transferred to county treasurers, he said.
“We’ve got a model that is very outdated. It’s a one-size-fits-all model,” Franzen said. “Standardized fee structures to fund these services don’t make sense in today’s world. A fee structure that allows local governments to charge fees necessary to provide the desired level of customer service is what is needed now.”
However, Rep. Shawn Tarwater, R-Stilwell, said Johnson County collected enough in property taxes annually to “more than make up” for costs incurred by the county to provide core government services outlined by the state.
In the audit report, auditors said Johnson County officials concluded the state’s requirement that motor vehicle titling be done in person was an administrative burden. Implementation of electronic titling in Kansas, as some states have done, would raised in the audit as an option for reducing staffing requirements, the counties told auditors.
Officials in the three audited counties said they disliked the state’s MOVRS computer system for registering motor vehicles. The report said the system was “slow and unreliable,” especially at the end of each month, “when the volume of activity spikes and the system is prone to crashes.”
 
‘Huge burden’
Steven Hirsch, who serves as Gove County attorney, said the western Kansas county could benefit from a surcharge on traffic tickets to handle costs incurred while enforcing state traffic law. He said the county’s administrative cost for criminal prosecutions was unusually high because 30 miles of Interstate 70 passed through Gove County. Without I-70, he said, Gove County might expect 250 traffic cases per year.
“Gove County handles 1,400 traffic cases,” Hirsch said. “This puts a huge burden on us as prosecutors and upon the courts.”
He said a majority of the offenders weren’t residents of Gove County. Small-population counties with long segments of interstate highway could benefit from state approval of a surcharge on traffic tickets to finance prosecution costs, he said.
In Johnson, Labette and Gove counties, auditors estimated the three spent $17.3 million on state-mandated criminal prosecutions in fiscal year 2024. The costs were offset by $846,000 in grants and user fees, the audit said.
Motor vehicle registration services in the three counties last year reached $8.3 million, and expenditures required by the state were partially offset with $5 million in user fees. The three counties devoted $3.2 million to collecting ad valorem taxes in 2024, but that was fully offset by $3.9 million in user fees and fines.
The three areas studied by auditors were chosen from among 18 core services provided by county governments in Kansas. Areas not considered in the audit included election administration, emergency management, jail operations, public health and property evaluation.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican, said she objected to repeated references to “state-mandated” services.
“I know that terminology is bantered around,” Tyson said. “Don’t the counties exist because of state statute? It kind of makes sense that we would oversee some of the functions of those counties.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Thomas-Granzen-johnson-county-treasurer-1024x564.png,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City charter school is a step away from forced closure after state officials reported “serious concerns” of poor instruction, financial struggles and organizational disarray.
Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, a charter high school known as PTPLA, has reduced its staff to only one teacher, a superintendent and a counselor to serve its 115 students, state officials said.
The Statewide Charter School Board voted unanimously on Monday to put PTPLA on probation and to require the school’s leaders to produce a turnaround plan by Nov. 26. Probation is one tier away from the board canceling a charter contract and shutting a school down.
PTPLA, which opened last year, has missed multiple deadlines to file financial reports and required documents with the state, staff for the statewide board said. After hiring a new treasurer, the school made a final Nov. 3 deadline to submit accounting reports with the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
Members of the board agreed their most urgent concern, though, is the quality of student instruction. They compared the situation multiple times to a dire medical emergency. 
“It’s like medical triage,” board member William Pearson said during the meeting. “If the patient’s not breathing, you’ve got to get them air, and if they’re bleeding, you’ve got to stop the bleeding. Along those same lines, you’ve got to get teachers into those classrooms.”
The school’s founder, Dawn Bowles, said after the meeting she looks forward to speaking with the statewide board and “wasn’t given that opportunity today.” She declined to share specifics of what she’d like to say to the board, who did not invite her to give remarks during its discussion Monday.

Several of the school’s parents and community supporters attended the board meeting at the Oklahoma History Center. Bowles described PTPLA as a “school for the community and by the community” that’s making a difference in its students’ lives.
“We’re going to keep moving and pushing,” she said. “We’ve had hurdle after hurdle, but we’ve jumped each one successfully. That’s what we do. We don’t stop. So, I look forward to the opportunity to speak.”
The chairperson of PTPLA’s school board, Sharri Coleman, spoke in a public comment portion of the meeting to highlight the school’s achievements, awards and college acceptances in its first year of operation. Enrollment, though, “was our steepest hill” to climb, she said.
Public schools, including charters, receive state funding based on the number of students they enroll. Failing to meet expected enrollment could cause a budget shortfall.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education approved the school’s concept in April 2024 and permitted it to open four months later — an unusually short amount of preparation time compared to most newly approved charter schools. Even at the time of approval, state Education Department staff openly expressed concerns about the school’s financial plan.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which requires an 18-month runway before opening a new charter school, inherited oversight of PTPLA from the state Board of Education last year because of changes to Oklahoma law.
“The school opened four months after their approval, and they could have waited another year,” statewide board chairperson Brian Shellem said after the meeting. “We might be having a totally different discussion if that were the case.”
PTPLA budget records show the school finished the previous fiscal year on June 30 with a $274,222 deficit.
Financial constraints led to a reduction in school staff a few months ago, said Skyler Lusnia, the statewide board’s financial compliance officer.

School leaders have said they plan to rehire teachers when more state funding comes through in January, and those who were laid off are volunteering at PTPLA in the meantime, Lusnia said in a presentation to the board.
Board staff have been looking into issues at the school since the spring, Lusnia said, but concerns grew after three recent visits to PTPLA indicated a “clear lack of student engagement and lack of rigor.”
The statewide board’s executive director, Rebecca Wilkinson, said she observed students with their computers open but not logged into their schoolwork. She said other students had their heads down, were on their cellphones or were laying down during her visits.
“We did see the one remaining teacher that is on staff on all three visits working directly with students,” Wilkinson told the board. “Instruction was concerning, but with 115 students and one teacher, that’s problematic.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) has launched a pilot program offering landlords free monthly transit passes to share with their tenants this holiday season.
Announced Monday, RIPTA’s Residential Transit Pilot Program lets landlords who own or manage at least 10 units near a bus route apply online for December and January passes. The initiative is intended to “promote sustainable travel choices and reduce reliance on personal vehicles,” according to the agency.
“By partnering directly with multifamily property owners and managers, we’re helping residents experience the convenience and value of public transportation in communities that are already transit-accessible,” CEO Christopher Durand said in a statement.
Covering the cost of the pass purchases is the remainder of a $145,000 allocation from the state’s Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council in October 2024 toward “growing transit ridership.”
Similar free passes have been earmarked for travelers who fly into Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport in the council’s fiscal 2026 plan approved in mid-September.
The council’s fiscal 2025 plan aims to boost ridership by lowering the cost of RIPTA transit passes purchased by employers, property owners, and social service agencies for their employees, tenants, and clients.
RIPTA is already coordinating with area employers to boost revenue. In January, the agency extended its 10x and 28 routes to align with shift schedules at the new Amazon Fulfillment Center off Route 6 in Johnston. In return, Amazon agreed to pay $90,000 annually over the next decade to cover employee fares.
In May, RIPTA announced that the Omni Providence Hotel had agreed to partially subsidize fares for 216 employees who work at the hotel. 
Increasing ridership has been an elusive goal for state leaders in recent years, as levels still remain below pre-pandemic levels.
In fiscal year 2024, the most recent agency data available, fixed-route buses served more than 12.6 million passengers, across more than 58 statewide routes. In fiscal year 2019, RIPTA buses provided around 16.4 million passenger trips.
Tenants who receive a monthly pass from their landlords will find fewer buses running this holiday season, as the agency in September enacted sweeping service reductions — cutting schedule spans, reducing frequency, and eliminating segments on 46 of its 67 routes.
The cuts were part of a cost-cutting measure meant to avert bus driver layoffs due to an initial $32.6 million dollar budget shortfall mostly filled by the General Assembly and last-minute “budget framework” from Gov. Dan McKee.
RIPTA’s financial outlook doesn’t appear any better next year. Last year’s spending request projects a $39.8 million deficit for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026. RIPTA’s board of directors is likely to review the agency’s spending request for the upcoming fiscal year when it meets on Dec. 4, 2025.

Nov. 11, 2025. Screenshot. Veterans from Michigan’s 7th and 10th Congressional Districts called out their representatives, U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Twp.), for votes that cut funding to health care, food assistance and veterans’ affairs programs, in a press conference hosted by Michigan Families for Fair Care on Veterans’ Day. 
“Even after service, I think a lot of veterans just have this inherent or developed sense that we need to take care of our fellow citizens,” said Steve Monti, an Army veteran from the 7th Congressional District. “I just can’t understand how Tom Barrett can lose that, or maybe he never had it, because the only people he’s taking care of are his donors.”
Barrett and James are Army veterans themselves — a fact that Monti said, as someone represented by Barrett makes his votes even more hurtful. 
“I just don’t understand how Tom Barrett can see his people, and just the anticipation of these cuts coming into effect, that he’s already voted for, is causing real world consequences, and he’s holding firm, and he’s hiding from his constituents,” he said. “Tom Barrett has yet to hold one town hall in person, and he knows that none of his constituents support him, and he hides behind the fact that he’s a veteran and he’s a disgrace.”
Absent Tom Barrett, 7th District town hall meeting lets constituents express concerns, frustrations

Sean McLaughlin, another constituent of Barrett’s and a Marine Corps veteran, noted that Medicaid is crucial for filling in gaps in veteran health care systems, such as providing dental care that would otherwise be excluded. 
But things are getting worse, McLaughlin continued. Mental health care for veterans is being limited to 20 sessions, according to reports received by Common Defense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group that he is a part of. Rural hospitals, including one in Carson City, Mich., he said, will close without Medicaid funding, which will harm not only veterans but every resident of the area. 
“Really listen, Representative Tom Barrett. Fund SNAP and healthcare, not billionaires,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what we need. That’s what this community needs, and that’s your job. Do it. Side with the veterans, side with your community, and not the interests.”
Joel Rutherford, an Air Force veteran and resident of Warren, Mich., in the 10th Congressional District, added that in working with other veterans in the area, he regularly sees veterans who rely on Medicaid for their health care because they do not qualify for or cannot access VA health care. 
“The ‘Big Billionaires Bill’ stripped work requirement exemptions from over 300,000 veterans nationwide. That’s 38,000 that are in Michigan,” Rutherford said, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed this summer. “I see veterans in Macomb County who are trying to live on $1,000 a month or less, and yet you want to cut things for them.”
“Cutting Medicaid means cutting lifelines for veterans struggling with PTSD, addiction and chronic conditions,” he added. “I expect better from veterans and obviously John James and Tom Barrett have totally forgotten about us.”
Michigan Families for Fair Care also showed a new ad campaign featuring Monti, which will air in Barrett’s district. 
“I was a gunner in Iraq. Our convoy was hit twice with IEDs,” Monti says in the video. “20 years later, I rely on the VA to survive. I feel betrayed when I see Tom Barrett cut veterans’ health care benefits to give tax breaks to billionaires. It’s just a spit in our face that he’s going to just abandon that many veterans.”
While neither Barrett nor James’ offices were available to comment due to the Veterans Day holiday, Barrett has previously expressed support for veterans services, having called on the VA in March to “review and reconsider” workforce reductions at the agency in the wake of plans to cut 80,000 positions. He also introduced legislation to maintain essential benefits, including health care, for veterans through the government shutdown, although the bill was never taken up. 
Similarly, James co-sponsored a bill in March to support veteran families’ access to mental health care, peer support, and other resources, although it also remains in committee.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)NEW PORT RICHEY — While Florida lawmakers continue to consider reducing or eliminating property taxes, Pasco County state legislators learned Monday that they would need to find an alternative source of funding to keep up services for residents updating motor vehicle records.
Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano said that 95% of the work his staff provides involve motor vehicle services, for which they receive a small percentage of the fees paid, but that’s not nearly enough to cover his costs. Those losses, he said, are made up through property taxes.
“Our money comes from the services we provide,” Fasano told the six Republicans attending the Pasco County legislative delegation meeting at Pasco-Hernando State College. “So, if you’re going to reduce or take away property taxes, that’s great. But someone’s going to have to fill that void of my budget of $20 million a year, because I still have to serve those 50,000 to 60,000 people a month in those five offices.”
In a follow-up interview, Fasano, a Republican who served in the Florida House and Senate for nearly 20 years (1994-2013), said hypothetically that if the state of Florida bans all property taxes, he’d need approximately $23 million to offset the deficit his office would run annually.

Tax collectors in Florida are considered “fee-based” officers, responsible for collecting ad valorem taxes set at the local level, including those by special districts, state agencies, and county commissions. They are responsible for issuing vehicle license plates, driver’s licenses, title transfers, vehicle registrations, and other essential services.
State law provides a tiered commission structure for county tax collectors based on the total taxes collected, with a 2% commission on the balance of taxes collected on behalf of each taxing district or special assessment district.
Fasano said his office loses approximately $4 million in providing those services and that that’s the situation for every tax collector in the state.
“So, it’s important that you understand that whatever you do with property taxes will have a huge impact on the tax collector offices,” he told lawmakers.
Florida House Republicans have offered at least seven proposed constitutional amendments to address property taxes during the 2026 legislative session, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has lambasted those proposals, saying he would prefer to place a single initiative before the voters in November 2026.
“It’s got to be very clearly written and give people a chance to vote for it,” the governor said at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa on Oct. 29. “What you don’t do is put five [constitutional amendments] on there … because they’re going to be written in ways that are not going to be clear — and so there’s going to create confusion on the ballot.”
At the conclusion of the three hour-plus meeting, members of the Pasco delegation weighed in on the topic, acknowledging the discussions may prove heated, but promising it will benefit those now paying taxes on their homestead properties.
“We’re fighting to bring you home money in your pocket, and it’s probably not going to be pretty for a little while longer, but, at the end of the day, it’s better than fighting to raise your taxes, like you probably see in every other state,” said Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb, who represents portions of both Pasco and Hernando counties.
“No state has done this. No state has eliminated property taxes. They’ve done a few things where they give you a $1,000 credit, lower some markers, or raise some exceptions, but no one’s done it. So, if we do it in Florida, and I hope we will, we’ll be setting the precedent again in the state of Florida.”
Ed Hooper, the Senate Appropriations chairman, acknowledged there hasn’t been much action from members of the Florida Senate on property taxes, but said that doesn’t mean the chamber isn’t working on the matter. “Trust me that the Senate is studying every component of what impact each of our proposals will have on 23.5 million Floridians,” he said.
“We’re trying to give you money back, someway,” added Republican Rep. Randy Maggard. “So, we’re looking at costs at every way we possibly can. So, it’s not really a bad thing, but we don’t want to be stupid and cut something that will cut costs or services. … We’ve got a long way to go on this.”
Meanwhile, Fasano said, it’s important for Gov. DeSantis to understand what severely reducing or outright eliminating property taxes could mean in terms of services local governments provide to Floridians on a daily basis.
“I would love to be able to sit down with the governor’s staff and explain this,” he said. “You want to reduce property taxes? I’m all for that. Just make sure you understand how it’s going to affect certain constitutional officers that have to still provide a service each day in their office.”

(Photo courtesy of ACLU-WV)Attorneys representing a transgender student athlete in Harrison County, West Virginia have filed their argument in a U.S. Supreme Court challenge of a state law that prohibits her from participating in her school’s track program. 
Attorneys for 15-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson filed the response with the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. She’s challenging West Virginia’s Save Women’s Sport Act, which former Gov. Jim Justice signed into law in 2021. Pepper-Jackson is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of West Virginia, Lambda Legal, and Cooley LLP.
The Supreme Court announced in July it would hear the state of West Virginia’s appeal of a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that blocked the law. The lower court found that the law violates transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs. 
“I play for my school for the same reason other kids on my track team do — to make friends, have fun, and challenge myself through practice and teamwork,” Pepper-Jackson said in an ACLU news release Monday. “And all I’ve ever wanted was the same opportunities as my peers. Instead, I’ve had my rights and my life debated by politicians who’ve never even met me but want to stop me from playing sports with my friends. 
“I know this case isn’t just about me, or even just about sports,” she said. “It’s just one part of a plan to push transgender people like me out of public life entirely. I’m proud to stand up alongside my mom for what I believe and who I am and I want other transgender kids to know they aren’t alone.”
In a September filing, attorneys for the state of West Virginia argued that transgender athletes are a threat to the promise of equity in women’s sports from Title IX.
“Male athletes identifying as female are increasingly competing in women’s sports, erasing the opportunities Title IX ensured,” they wrote. “Women and girls have lost places on sports teams, surrendered spots on championship podiums, and suffered injuries competing against bigger, faster and stronger males. For too many women and girls, the ‘thrill of victory’ is gone.”
The president of the NCAA recently told Congress, “less than 10”  — and not all of them transgender women — of the more than 500,000 college athletes in the country are openly transgender.
The high court announced it would hear the case in July. At that time, state attorney general J.B. McCuskey said that the people of West Virginia know it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women.
“That’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said in a July news release. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Former Gov. Patrick Morrisey represented the state in the case during his time as attorney general. He said in a July news release he was pleased the court would take up the case. 
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.

According to records related to a search warrant authorized for Bates’ home and vehicle, Indianola police received information in April 2025 from the Indianola Hy-Vee store indicating Bates had been fired a few days earlier and was the focus of an investigation into the possible theft of drugs.
According to the warrant application, store management believed Bates had been creating phony prescriptions for medications using the name of actual medical providers and the names of both real and fictious patients, filling the prescriptions and billing the cost to insurance providers, and then later taking the bottles of medications out of the store at the end of his shift.
The store alleged it had compiled video of Bates going through those steps and had correlated the timing of those actions to Bates’ computer entries.
The warrant and other court records indicate store officials believed at least 3,703 pills — many of them for Adderall, a narcotic, and the drug Vyvanse, a narcotic stimulant — may have been misappropriated.
In the application for the search warrant, a police officer reported that it was “important to note that Bates was on his cell phone a majority of this time and appeared to be texting/communicating with someone.”
According to the warrant application, Hy-Vee personnel indicated they confronted Bates about the alleged theft and that while he admitted creating the phony bottle labels, he asserted he did so not to steal medications but to deal with discrepancies in the pharmacy’s drug inventory.
Court records indicate that on April 23, 2025, police executed the search warrant at Bates’ home and seized pill bottles, prescription paperwork and a cell phone. A second warrant was later obtained for the contents of the phone.
On May 28, 2025, criminal charges were filed in the case, with police alleging Bates had created phony prescriptions in the names of 55 actual patients and four nonexistent patients. In one such instance, Bates allegedly used the name of one patient to create six fake prescriptions for more than 300 Adderall and Vyvanse pills.
Police allege Bates also used the names of at least seven different doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in creating the fabricated prescriptions. The Hy-Vee store has claimed the total value of the drugs at issue is $71,231.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy alleges Bates is suspected of not only theft, but insurance fraud, with fraudulent billings made to insurers to account for the pharmacy’s cost of dispensing the drugs.
After the board charged Bates with knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy, and with diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution, Bates recently agreed to surrender his license.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A new report from the Iowa Food System Coalition shows that Iowa has 1,461 local food businesses spread across the state.
Coalition staff said the report shows the economic viability of local food businesses across the levels of the food system. 
Bob Ferguson, who serves on the Farm and Food Business priority team with the coalition, said the report showed an increase in the number of on-farm stores, farm stands and local food businesses from previous estimations.
“There’s more there than one would suspect,” he said. “There needs to be a lot more, but there’s already robust local infrastructure that interacts with itself to provide local goods and services.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The businesses, which include food farmers, processors, food hubs and more, are spread across the state, with greater concentration around Iowa’s largest cities. 
The majority, or 1,074, of the businesses are farmers and food producers. Meat and food processors make up the next highest category, with 189 meat processors and 47 food processors in the state. 
The report identified between 10 and 26, per category, of local wineries, restaurants, retail stores, groceries and dairy manufacturers in Iowa. 
The remaining categories had fewer than 10 businesses each identified in the state: grade A dairies, breweries, coffee, food hubs, raw milk, uncategorized, grain mills, caterers, distributors and private chef services. 
The report defined local food businesses as producers that sell direct to consumer, strategic supply chain partners and some large volume distribution services that make “substantial and effective efforts to produce or market source-identified local foods.” 
Ferguson said the food system has become heavy at the top level and at at the small-scale level, but has been “hollowed” in the middle. 
This report that shows the number and spread of local food businesses, he said, shows that “infrastructure at the middle is still there.” Ferguson predicts the number of businesses will only continue to grow in the state.
“It doesn’t make sense for Iowa to import 90-95% of our food when we have the best ground … We don’t in any way need to compete with commodity production to be very significant,” Ferguson said. 
In addition to providing local food infrastructure and economic impact, Ferguson said these local business also provide a “powerful sense of placemaking” or the “coolness factor” that helps people “feel great about being where they are,” which he said is important for rural development. 
The report analyzed online directories, like the state’s Choose Iowa network, various food hubs, farmers market databases and registries for licensed dairy and meat processing plants. Because the report only makes use of regularly updated online lists, the coalition notes it is “likely an under-count” of local food businesses. 
The coalition hopes future iterations of the report will also include business that don’t have an online presence.
“I feel very certain based on what I’ve seen … that this is going to be a growing percentage of our food, and a very significant and valuable element of economic development,” Ferguson said.

,DC,2025-11-11 18:24:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hemp-growers-retailers-targeted-section-government-shutdown-legislation,,"WASHINGTON — Kentucky’s two U.S. senators sparred this week over the future of the country’s hemp industry — one arguing that a provision attached to the package that will reopen the government will close a problematic loophole and the other contending the language will regulate the industry “to death.”Sen. Mitch McConnell ultimately prevailed and was able to keep the section in the Agriculture appropriations bill cracking down on hemp that Sen. Rand Paul tried to remove during floor debate. Both are Republicans.The appropriations bill is riding along with a stopgap spending bill that will end the government shutdown and is expected to be voted on by the House as soon as Wednesday. The hemp measure has raised alarm in farm states benefiting from a robust hemp growing industry.Hemp plants have 0.3% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, while cannabis or marijuana plants have higher concentrations of that substance, which is what gives users the “high or stoned” feeling. A summary of the bill put together by Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins’ staff says the new language would prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a warning page on its website cautioning “that delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by the FDA for safe use in any context.”Farm Bill originsMcConnell explained he is targeting hemp because its uses have expanded beyond what was intended. ""I led the effort to legalize industrial hemp through the 2014 pilot program and the 2018 Farm Bill,"" McConnell said. ""Unfortunately, companies have exploited a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances, and then marketing it to children in candy-like packaging and selling it in easily accessible places, like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country.""McConnell said the new provision, which won’t take effect until a year after the bill becomes law, would “keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.”Paul and Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley urged their colleagues to remove that McConnell provision from the larger spending package, but were unsuccessful. “This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time,” Paul said. The new language would change the definition of what makes a hemp plant legal, a move Paul said would mean “every plant in the country will have to be destroyed.” “This bill's per-serving THC content limit would make illegal any hemp product that contains more than point four milligrams,” Paul said. “That would be nearly 100% of the existing market. That amounts to an effective ban, because the limit is so low that the products intended to manage pain or anxiety will lose their effect.”State laws said to be nullifiedThe legislation, Paul added, will negatively impact the nearly two dozen states that have set higher limits on hemp production.“Currently, Maine limits THC to three milligrams per serving. That will be overruled. My home state limits THC to five milligrams in beverages; that will be overruled. Minnesota, Utah, Louisiana also have five milligrams per serving. Alabama and Georgia have 10 milligrams. Tennessee has 15 milligrams,” Paul said. “The bill before us nullifies all these state laws.”Merkley said the new provision in the larger spending package would eliminate the hemp industry, which Congress took steps to establish more than a decade ago.“I support my other colleague from Kentucky who doesn't want intoxicated products produced from hemp,” Merkley said. “But the definition that is in this bill does far more than that, and it has to be fixed. So for now, it needs to be stripped out.”The Senate voted 76-24 to table, or set aside, Paul’s amendment after McConnell moved to block it from being taken up directly. The Agriculture funding bill is one of three full-year government spending bills included in the stopgap spending package that will end the government shutdown once the House approves the measure later this week and President Donald Trump signs the bill. Trade group warns of hundreds of thousands of jobs affectedHemp Industry & Farmers of America Executive Director Brian Swensen wrote in a statement released last week that McConnell's provision would have a devastating impact on the industry and its workers. ""Congress legalized hemp, Americans built an industry, and now Washington wants to pull the rug out from under hardworking farmers and small business owners. The industry wants a solid regulatory package that protects kids, but instead, Congress wants to place industry-killing caps on cannabinoids. Congress is not listening to the industry they created — they’re dismantling an industry with over 325,000 jobs and driving consumers to an unregulated, unsafe, and untaxed black market.""",,,,2025-11-11 14:01:56.661826

North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice not seeking another term in top post

Fair McEvers has served as a justice since 2014, when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a vacancy left by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. Fair McEvers was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
She previously pursued the position of chief justice in 2019.
Fair McEvers was formerly a state district court judge and North Dakota labor commissioner.
Tufte was elected to a 10-year term on the North Dakota Supreme Court in 2016. Prior to his service on the high court, he was legal counsel for Dalrymple and a state district court judge.   
Jensen was elected chief justice in December 2019 and reelected to another five-year term in 2020. In a letter to the court system last week, Jensen said he would not seek reelection to the position when his term as chief expires at the end of 2025. He will continue serving as a justice.
Jensen’s letter did not provide a reason for not seeking another term.

Maia Jackson should have been cranking out a research paper for her communications class. Instead, she found herself queuing up at a food pantry to secure groceries for her household amid the nation’s longest government shutdown.
“I walked out with a shopping cart full of food,” the 25-year-old college senior said. “I could barely carry it all. I got cereal. I got some frozen meat, hamburger buns. I got a bag of black beans, and then I got a bag of rice.”
Finding a package of chicken strips, a dish she knew her picky 2-year-old daughter would actually eat, almost made her cry, Jackson said. She expects the combination of perishable, bagged and canned foods to last them a month. By then, she hopes her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  payments — widely known as food stamps — will have resumed.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

On Nov. 1, SNAP benefits ground to a halt during the federal budget impasse that began a month earlier, with President Donald Trump’s administration refusing to fully fund these payments, a matter now tied up in court. Even as the Senate has reached a framework deal that leaves lawmakers and the White House a step closer to ending the shutdown, the disruption in benefits has revealed how fragile the social safety net is for vulnerable Americans. That includes single parents and young adults experiencing food insecurity, a problem that occurs when people lack regular access to the nourishment needed to sustain their health.
An estimated 1.1 million college students rely on SNAP, including parents like Jackson, who attends North Dakota State University in Fargo. For such students, a delayed SNAP payment isn’t a mere hiccup, but a serious setback that can imperil their education, their health and stability for their children, experts contend.
“It’s such a distraction for me as a single mom in school,” Jackson said. “I don’t have any bandwidth to give to trying to find food at pantries.”
She tried to minimize the time she spent at the food pantry last week by making an appointment first, but she was still one of a couple of dozen people in line. The visit prevented her from completing her research paper by its due date, which will likely result in her grade being docked. Jackson, who has so far maintained a 4.0 grade point average, isn’t happy about that prospect, but with her family members an hour away and her child’s father mostly out of the picture, she had to prioritize food over her education.

No college student should have to choose between a basic need and school, said Deborah Martin, a senior policy associate for The Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit that advocates for college access and affordability.
“A lot of students have to make these daily tough decisions where they’re wondering, ‘Where am I going to get my next meal from?’ instead of focusing on homework, on classwork,” Martin said. “We know that when students have these unmet basic needs such as food insecurity, they’re more likely to struggle academically, less likely to persist from semester to semester, and in some cases, may even drop out of college altogether.”
Roughly 60% of college students are women. For the most marginalized students, the risk of quitting school due to food insecurity may be even greater. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides fact-based information to Congress, reported last year that about 80% of food-insecure students are nontraditional — meaning their parents don’t financially support them, they didn’t begin college immediately after high school or they are caring for dependents. Moreover, the 2023-2024 Student Basic Needs Survey Report from the Hope Center, a research center at Temple University focused on the food, housing and health of college students, found that around three-quarters of parenting, Black and Indigenous students experience insecurity related to a basic need.
Most of these students, the Government Accountability Office discovered, do not sign up for services like SNAP, and those who do may hesitate to discuss their food insecurity. As a mom and a slightly older student who works part-time, Jackson has felt largely alone on campus as SNAP benefits have paused. Her classmates don’t appear to share her anxiety over the shutdown, if they know about it at all.

“A lot of the kids that I’m in class with, they’re not in the same circumstance,” Jackson said. “It’s weird to see a lot of people just carrying on as usual.”
Since most of her classmates — about an even percentage of NDSU students are women and men — are childfree and on the school meal plan, she doesn’t want to be a “downer” by bringing up her difficulties. For the same reason, she didn’t explain to her professor why her paper was late. “I didn’t want to tell him, ‘Oh, I couldn’t write it because I was standing in the food pantry line’ because it just sounds so sad,” she said. “What’s he supposed to say? I don’t want him to feel bad for me. I don’t want to be pitied.”
But faking normal could come at a high cost for college students who don’t reach out for help. Martin fears these young adults will resort to using high-interest payment plans or acquire credit card debt just to afford groceries.
“The longer that students and other SNAP participants don’t receive their funds, this is just more days that students are going to have to make these difficult decisions,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some college administrators are taking action. When the shutdown began, Compton College President and CEO Keith Curry contacted Everytable, a food company that offers inexpensive made-from-scratch meals via carryout storefronts and a delivery service. The college, about 18 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, has partnered with Everytable for seven years to provide all students — approximately 6,000 of whom attend full time — with one nutritious free meal on weekdays.
The federal government crisis prompted Curry and Everytable CEO Sam Polk to scale up that program so SNAP-recipient and economically disadvantaged students didn’t suffer during the shutdown.
“We need to do something. Can we split the cost?” Curry recalled asking Polk. “I think if we double the meals, at least they get another meal for the day.”
On November 5, Compton College’s most underprivileged students began getting two free meals per day, or 10 per week. The need for such an intervention there is substantial: A 2025 basic needs survey of students found that 81 percent of them experience at least one form of insecurity related to a basic need. That includes signs of food insecurity such as skipping meals, reducing meal sizes or fearing they will run out of food. Most Compton College students are moderately food insecure, the survey revealed, indicating persistent hardship. Women make up 61 percent of the student body.
“Right now, students have other stress, and what we’re doing to them is adding more stress,” Curry said of the shutdown. “They still want to do well in classes, but now they don’t have food.”
Together, Compton College and Everytable have the resources to supply students with 10 weekly meals for a month, Curry said. The students are deeply grateful for the additional provisions, according to Dee Garrett, who oversees Everytable’s operation at the college.
“What better way to start your studies than with a stomach that’s full?” Garrett asked. “You don’t have to think about, ‘Oh, my God, my stomach. I can’t concentrate or focus.’”
Asked what impact he hopes the scaled-up program makes, Curry said he’s more interested in letting students know they’re not alone.
“It’s not about the impact. It’s about our students knowing that we were there for them during this time,” he said. “In our community, when students need us most, we have to step up and be there for them, and they’re never going to forget that.”
Martin applauds the efforts of colleges and K-12 schools, which have connected students and their families to food banks, to curb food insecurity during the shutdown. But she also advocates for long-term policies to ensure students have enough food to eat. That includes the Enhance Access to SNAP Act, proposed legislation to remove the barriers that prevent economically disadvantaged college students from utilizing benefits generally — not just during the current crisis.
However, Martin continued, “the most important thing that we can do right now in this moment is for these SNAP benefits to be fully funded and for them to go out to students as soon as possible.”

Back in Fargo, Jackson has refocused her attention on her coursework now that she has a month’s worth of food. Still, she worries about the people who couldn’t make it to a pantry or that the government will cut other social services she needs. She currently earns $400 monthly working part time as an academic journal editor. The job, which she performs remotely, allows her to attend school and be her daughter’s primary caretaker when the toddler is not in day care.
“If they cut child care, if they cut these programs I rely on, I would have to drop out of school,” Jackson said. “But I’m trying to give my daughter a better life than that.”
Jackson is majoring in university studies with a pre-law emphasis, a dramatic shift from her life before motherhood when she dropped out of school and struggled with addiction. Getting pregnant inspired her to undergo a transformation, which she largely credits to the Jeremiah Program. The national nonprofit provides single mothers with support for college, child care and housing, and it recently started a campaign to raise $190,000 to cover essential needs for families who have lost SNAP and other benefits because of the shutdown. The organization estimates that single-parent families represent nearly a third of families in the United States, with 80 percent of those headed by mothers.
Jackson has been deeply disturbed to see the misperceptions that abound about mothers like herself. She’s encountered online commenters who have characterized SNAP recipients as “welfare queens.”
If she could confront such individuals in person, Jackson would emphasize how much value mothers add to society. “And on top of it… we are all in school and working, too,” she said. “The insinuation is that we’re just scammers, freeloaders, when, in reality, I’m working very hard every day to hopefully not need these supports.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-11 17:46:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,People are regularly wounded at this Jackson apartment complex. Suing the landlord has only gotten harder.,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/11/wounded-jackson-landlord-lawsuits/,"For years, legal battles routinely led to monetary settlements for the victims of violence at Rebelwood or their family, but that changed after the Mississippi Landowners Protection Act.","On a Sunday afternoon in 2017, a masked assailant came from around a building, shooting and killing Teresa Hughes’ son, Kendrick, as he stood talking to two friends at Pine Ridge Gardens Apartments in southeast Jackson.  
A few months later, four John Does riding through the parking lot shot at Christine Christon, almost striking her minor son who was sitting in a car seat. 
Christon dove from the spray of bullets, but the shooters hit Arsentell Burton 13 times, permanently incapacitating him. Burton’s pastor had dropped him off at the complex so he could help his uncle move. 
After the shootings, Hughes, Christon and Burton did as dozens of Jacksonians before them: They hired a lawyer and filed suit, alleging out-of-state landlords failed to provide adequate security, fostering an “atmosphere of violence” at the federally funded complex commonly known as Rebelwood.
For years, these legal battles routinely led to monetary settlements, providing a modicum of justice for some of Rebelwood’s more than 400 tenants living in deadly and dire conditions, according to 15 lawsuits filed since 2010 that Mississippi Today reviewed. 
But in 2019, lawmakers passed a bill known as the Mississippi Landowners Protection Act that has all but shielded landlords from liability for violent crimes committed on their properties. It has done so by limiting what constitutes an “atmosphere of violence” – a legal term describing conditions in which the property owner should have known injuries were likely and taken steps to prevent them.
Since then, local attorneys say liability has been harder to prove — and accountability less achievable — even if the landlord has neglected to take reasonable steps to secure the complex, such as hiring security, fixing broken lights, maintaining cameras or removing trespassers from the property. 
Nicole Gibson launched such a battle. The Jackson native filed her lawsuit in 2022 after her son, Quindarius, was killed in the Rebelwood parking lot while the two were running an errand for family staying there. The incident occurred just one year after the Landowners Protection Act passed.
She went up against the companies responsible for the property at the time of her son’s death: The Texas-based owner, Rebelwood Apartments, and a New Jersey-based behemoth management company, Michaels Management Affordable. Last month, a Hinds County Circuit Court judge granted a motion to dismiss the case from a lawyer representing the companies – a hurdle Gibson’s attorney, Phillip Hearn, fears they won’t overcome if he appeals. 
In an email, an attorney for Michaels Management Affordable said the company’s policy is not to comment on pending litigation. The Texas company that previously owned Rebelwood has shuttered. 
Gibson, 43, struggles with the notion of attaining justice for her son, nicknamed “Bubba,” whom she said had never been in trouble with the law – but for one time she took him to the county youth detention center for disrespecting her. He had graduated high school, worked at McDonald’s for years and played football for a local amateur team called the Magnolia State Knights.
“They just knew from the life that he lived that he was not supposed to die,” she said. “I tell everybody, ‘It’s a hard pill to swallow.’” 
This is not to say plaintiffs lawsuits have done much to address the chronically poor conditions facing tenants who live in areas of Jackson with higher crime rates. Rebelwood remains one of the most notorious places to live in the city. Residents there continue to experience problems on a daily basis, from criminal incidents to grim living conditions of the kind that led Mayor John Horhn to convene a housing task force earlier this year.

In a recent meeting, task force members lauded the Landowners Protection Act for helping landlords weather the fallout of the decision by insurance companies, which were losing money to settlements, to discontinue coverage of claims stemming from violent crimes at complexes in Jackson.
“Every claim I’ve ever had on my properties is cumulative, it’s passed on. It’s like a credit check or a credit report,” said Jennifer Welch, a Jackson-based property manager and vice chair of the city’s housing task force. “It’s very unfortunate.” 
Meanwhile, Jacksonians who’ve been harmed at Rebelwood or lost their loved ones have little recourse but to file these lawsuits, known in the legal world as “premises liability” cases. Earlier this year, a woman filed suit after she was struck by a bullet that entered through her living room window, according to her complaint. Her case is pending.
“You can’t have all the laws be for the consumer, because then people can’t make money. I get it,” said Catouche Body, an attorney who represented Christon. “I just think the Landowners Protection Act goes a step too far.” 
Former state Rep. Mark Baker, a Republican from Brandon who championed the bill, said he did not recall the Landowners Protection Act well enough to comment on its impact.

Before the 2019 act, lawyers frequently secured settlements in these cases. Hearn has several under his belt. When the parties couldn’t agree, the cases went to juries who were sympathetic to victims. In 2009, a jury awarded a $3 million judgment to the family of a woman whose body was found at Rebelwood (though the Mississippi Supreme Court later reversed that decision, ruling evidence she’d been killed elsewhere was withheld from trial). 
But under the new law, Hearn and other attorneys must prove a landlord “impelled” the criminal conduct of the man who shot Gibson – a term plaintiffs lawyers told Mississippi Today they’re not sure how to interpret.
“What the hell does that mean?” Hearn said. 
Attorneys must also show that violent conduct at the property in the three years leading up to an incident has resulted in three or more felony arraignments.
This might seem like an easy standard to meet at Rebelwood, where police have received calls of more than 100 shootings since the beginning of 2024, according to dispatch records obtained by Mississippi Today. 
But when Hearn tried to gather the data, he said he hit a wall. Even though Rebelwood has been the site of numerous arrests for violent crimes in the three years leading up to Quindarius’s death, Hearn said he could not identify three felony indictments, the legal step proceeding an arraignment.
“I’ve subpoenaed the Hinds County District Attorney, the Hinds County attorney, the Jackson city attorney, the sheriff’s department, the Jackson Police Department, and every one of them says, ‘We do not maintain this information,’” Hearn said. 
Where he might have once convinced a jury of pervasive violence using a 911 log – which shows roughly two calls a day from Rebelwood in recent years – or social media videos of fights at the complex that routinely go viral, Hearn said this kind of proof does not meet the redefined legal standard. 
Hearn has already lost one case against the complex on behalf of another mother whose son was shot at Rebelwood while visiting his girlfriend. He can add Gibson’s case to the list. Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Eleanor Faye Peterson dismissed the case last month after Hearn could not find three arraignments.
“It’s a different age,” Hearn said. “And guess what, Rebelwood is more dangerous than ever.”

Government officials have taken far-reaching action in the past against Rebelwood, which opened in 1980. History lingers in the Civil War-themed street names still surrounding the troubled complex — Rebel Wood, Shiloh, Gray, Champion Hill. 
In 1996, Brad Pigott, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, filed for forfeiture against the owners of the complex, alleging the number of drug complaints at Rebelwood showed they were not complying with federal standards. 
Faced with the threat of losing the property, the owners pledged to install fences and screen applicants, resulting in what Pigott at the time called a “remarkable” turnaround.

Desiree Hensley, the director of the University of Mississippi School of Law’s Low-Income Housing Clinic, said city leaders could take similar action today. The council could seek to condemn Rebelwood for violating nuisance ordinances and force the complex to close until the landlord has improved the property. 
“The local government’s hands are definitely not tied,” she said. 
Kevin Parkinson, the Ward 7 Jackson city council member who represents Rebelwood, said shutting down the complex could send vulnerable people into the street, even as the city needs to do more in addressing its “unacceptable” conditions. 
“Do we have solutions for 450 people to go elsewhere in the city?” Parkinson said. “I’m not sure that we do.” 
Gibson was familiar with Rebelwood long before Quindarius was killed that day in 2020. Her sister had moved there in the late 1990s, around the time Quindarius was born. Her mother moved there a few years later. Gibson remembers kids playing water balloons and basketball and the security guard, Mr. Jimmy, who she said kept the complex in order.
“Mr. Jimmy had developed a relationship with the community out there,” she said. “He did not play.” 
Hiawatha Northington II, a local attorney for Michaels Management Affordable who worked on Gibson’s case, remembers Rebelwood, too, as a place he used to visit friends during undergrad at Jackson State University in the 1990s.
Amenities like the Kroger on Terry Road – now an empty storefront – were close by. 
“Whether you represent plaintiffs, defendants or neither, there are facts about the city of Jackson that are not in dispute and one of them is that areas like Terry Road have been systemically disinvested in for whatever reasons you want to attribute it to,” Northington said. 
Improving conditions at Rebelwood would require a systemic solution, Northington said, which he feels individual lawsuits cannot achieve. 
“Interpersonal conflicts can happen at the Country Club of Jackson just like they can happen at North Hills Apartments,” he said. “Some of those things are beyond what the civil justice system can address.”

Gibson was heading to Rebelwood on the afternoon of Saturday, April 25, 2020 to drop off some clothes to her brother, who was staying there, when Quindarius asked if he could ride with.
She didn’t think it was a good idea. Gibson knew Quindarius was at odds with a group of men at Rebelwood over the outcome of a dice game earlier that week. Quindarius had won $5, but when he tried to collect, the player threatened him. Gibson said she wanted to talk to that player’s parents, but Quindarius begged her not to, claiming the situation had been resolved. 
“Me personally, I’m going to diffuse the situation,” she said. “I will never indulge in a kid’s beef.”

But when they arrived at Rebelwood, the 21-year-old son spotted a friend and told Gibson he was going to stay at the complex.
The mother recounted what happened next – a chaotic series of events that culminated in Quindarius’s killing – in a court filing in her lawsuit against Rebelwood. As she was speaking to her brother’s friend, she said she saw a group heading in Quindarius’s direction. Suddenly, he came storming toward her car, asking if he could borrow his uncle’s gun, telling Gibson he was “tired of them threatening him.” 
She said no. Then she called the police. But instead of aiding Quindarius, Gibson said the officers escorted her off the property. Driving down the highway, she was on the phone with her twin sister, who was at the complex when gunshots rang out.
Gibson said she “snapped.” She characterizes the perpetrators as a “family which plotted his death” and ruminates on how things could have gone differently.
“I could’ve put a gun in my baby’s hand and let him do whatever he wanted to do, and I guarantee he would be home with me today,” she told Mississippi Today.
Without a weapon of his own, Gibson argues no one was there to protect him.
“You’ve got management just sitting out there,” she said. “They’ve got protection for them, but when it comes to the kids and the people living there, a lot of time they get in their car and leave the property because they be scared for themselves.” 
Quindarius’ alleged shooter, 38-year-old Joe Willis, is out on bond, and Gibson is not optimistic that he will be convicted. She said it took years to forgive herself for bringing Quindarius with her to Rebelwood, only doing so after taking a job that sent her across the country, giving her space and time to think. 
She concluded that she was not the only one responsible for her son’s safety that day. But now she feels alone in her pursuit of accountability.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A handful of county-level officials who were involved in a small-town Kansas newspaper raid in 2023 will pay a cumulative $3 million to three journalists and a city councilor.
In two of the four agreements, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office also crafted a statement admitting regret.
“The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record. This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,” the statement reads.
Marion County’s board of commissioners approved agreements Monday with Eric Meyer, the owner and editor of the Marion County Record, and Ruth Herbel, the Marion city councilor whose home was raided in tandem with the newspaper office, and two other journalists. The agreements coincide with consent judgments expected to be submitted in their federal cases against the county.
The county was a secondary player in the raids, in Meyer’s eyes, but the agreements could play a part in the paper’s ongoing cases against the city.
“Everybody involved in this is 100% convinced we are going to go to trial with the city,” Meyer said. “This will make that easier in some regard.”
The county’s agreements with Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn, local journalists whose lives were upended by the raids, are more akin to settlements and don’t include admissions of regret.
The county agreed to pay Meyer $1.5 million, Herbel and Zorn $650,000 apiece, and Gruver $250,000, according to copies of the agreements obtained by Kansas Reflector.
Insurance covers most of those funds, but the county must pay Meyer $50,000.
In another lawsuit against former Marion police chief Gideon Cody, who is also facing criminal charges, Gruver settled earlier this year for $235,000.
According to Meyer, Zorn has resigned from her position at the Marion County Record, effective immediately.
Monday’s deals settle the county’s obligations within four federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and Marion County governments and officials in the wake of the raids. Five cases were consolidated into a single federal lawsuit, and the four agreements give the county and the sheriff’s office immunity from any future legal action related to the Aug. 11, 2023, searches and seizures at the Marion County Record, Meyer’s home and Herbel’s home.
The county agreed to make available Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez, Detective Aaron Christner, and Undersheriff Larry Starkey for official interviews, which could be used in other legal disputes. Previously, the cases were stalled, preventing interviews from taking place.

Rounds said those bills include seven of his congressionally directed spending requests, also known as earmarks. Four of those are for construction projects at Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City to accommodate the future addition of B-21 bomber planes, which are under development:

$4.8 million for planning and design for a Weapons Generation Facility Dormitory.
$3.5 million for planning and design of a Communications Center.
$4 million for 11 new munitions storage structures.
$5.4 million for two other munitions storage structures.

Rounds’ other earmarks are:

$1.7 million for an aircraft maintenance hangar at Joe Foss Field in Sioux Falls.
$2 million for South Dakota State University’s Cottonwood Field Station renovation and expansion in western South Dakota.
$500,000 for SDSU’s Transient Animal Research Support Facility.

The spending bill passed the Senate on Monday night, with yes votes from Rounds and Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota. The House is expected to clear the legislation for President Donald Trump’s signature later this week, which would end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.
Rounds issued a statement saying “it’s now time to move forward and continue working on our regular order appropriations process, but we can’t ignore the devastating effect that six weeks of a government shutdown has had on our nation.” He said thousands of federal workers have gone without pay, millions of families have had the federal benefits they use to feed their children put at risk and the nation’s air travel system has been thrown into chaos.
“It’s my hope that these families who have suffered real damaging effects can move forward with their lives,” Rounds said. “We must work hard in the Senate to prevent a shutdown like this from happening again.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe argues in new court documents that a federal judge was wrong to dismiss its latest lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit, which seeks to shut the pipeline down, last October.
The tribe argues the Army Corps flouted federal law by allowing the Dakota Access Pipeline, also known as DAPL, to operate without an easement to cross Lake Oahe. Lake Oahe is a reservoir of the Missouri River that borders the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota state line.
Judge slashes jury damages in Greenpeace case to $345 million

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg dismissed the case in March, finding that the tribe was relitigating claims it already brought before his court in a previous lawsuit filed in 2016. At the time of the first suit, Standing Rock was leading a protest movement against the pipeline’s construction that brought thousands of demonstrators to rural south-central North Dakota. 
The tribe disputed Boasberg’s dismissal in new arguments filed last week with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This appeal is a necessary step to hold the Corps accountable for its unlawful actions, to protect our people from the ongoing risks posed by DAPL, and to ensure that our sovereignty is respected,” Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear said in a Friday statement. 
Standing Rock says Boasberg’s dismissal should be reversed because the Army Corps of Engineers’ yearslong inaction on the easement counts as a separate issue the courts haven’t ruled on yet.
“These are not challenges to past decisions but to the Corps’ ongoing violations of clear statutory duties,” the tribe wrote in court records.
The Army Corps initially granted the oil pipeline an easement in 2017, but Boasberg revoked it in 2020 after finding the agency had broken the law by not fully evaluating the pipeline’s environmental impacts.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe files new lawsuit over DAPL

Boasberg ordered the Corps to conduct a complete environmental impact study, which is still pending five years later. The agency published a draft in late 2023. 
While the judge in court orders has been critical of the Army Corps’ failure to move faster, he said this isn’t something the tribe can sue over.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” he wrote in his March order.
He said the tribe may file another lawsuit once the Army Corps finishes its environmental impact study and takes final action on the easement.
The tribe in the case claims the Army Corps violated a number of other federal laws related to the Dakota Access Pipeline, including that it hasn’t enforced regulatory standards for emergency spill response plans.
Standing Rock has said in court filings it has new evidence showing the pipeline is unsafe. The pipeline developer, Energy Transfer, has indicated previously it does not consider the information credible. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We still need people to stand with us. People think Standing Rock ended when DAPL went online in 2017,” said Doug Crow Ghost, Standing Rock’s director of water resources.
The tribe also alleges that the Army Corps failed to investigate reports that sacred cultural sites were destroyed during the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which it says is required under the National Historic Preservation Act. The pipeline company disputes that it desecrated cultural sites.
The Dakota Access Pipeline passes through unceded land recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation in 19th century treaties with the U.S. government.
Several states, including North Dakota, have intervened in the lawsuit as defendants. The states have argued that shuttering the pipeline would harm the regional economy, make road and rail transit more dangerous and would violate states’ rights.
Dakota Access, the pipeline’s owner, also joined the lawsuit on the side of the Army Corps. Dakota Access is owned by subsidiaries and affiliates of Energy Transfer.
The federal government, intervening states and Dakota Access are expected to respond to the tribe’s arguments by early January.

	Barbara Kelley remembers when her car and windows were routinely coated with a thin film of coal dust that had drifted over from the power plant on the edge of her neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. She remembers the noise as a conveyor belt lifted the coal into the building. She also remembers how pleased she was when the community started to discuss the possibility of building an offshore wind terminal on the site when the plant eventually closed.


“The coal plant — it worked, it gave us energy, but it was time to change,” Kelley said. ​“My reaction was, having a wind port is part of having wind energy — and that’s a good thing.”


In the years since the coal plant shut down in 2014, Kelley and many other community members have worked to promote the goal of transforming part of the property into a staging ground where wind turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles can be prepared for transport to offshore construction sites south of Cape Cod and north in the Gulf of Maine. The vision was to turn Salem Harbor, one of the country’s oldest ports, into a linchpin of the then-burgeoning offshore wind industry and provide an economic boost to some of Salem’s most disadvantaged residents.


Last year, that dream seemed close at hand. City and state leadership had embraced the idea. The state had promised a hefty investment, and the Biden administration had awarded the project a sizable grant. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the development in August 2024, and operations were expected to begin in 2026.


Project developer Crowley had agreed to pour nearly $9 million into a community benefits agreement that included job training, childcare, emergency services, and local sustainability and resilience efforts. Planners estimated construction and operations would create hundreds of jobs. And the whole process of bringing the idea to life gave community members a sense of agency and hope for their city.


Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679million in federal funding for offshore wind ports. The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector. Now, like those in so many communities across the country, the people of Salem find themselves facing the fallout of national political priorities, and wondering whether more than a decade of work will ever bear fruit.


“I feel like we’re all a little bit in the dark still,” said Lucy Corchado, a local activist who was part of the group that negotiated the community benefits agreement. ​“I hope we hear some good news, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen.”
 The path to an offshore wind port


Community advocates first started floating the idea of building a wind port on Salem Harbor roughly 15 years ago. At the time, plans were underway to build a commercial wind farm off Cape Cod, and the coal plant’s closure looked likely. The advocates saw a promising future for the large industrial waterfront parcel in what seemed to be a growing energy sector.


Once the epicenter of the spice trade in early America, Salem has a deepwater port that today serves mostly recreational boaters, tourist outings, and the occasional cruise ship. Though the city is home to a hospital, university, and thriving hospitality sector, it also has a median household income well below the average in most surrounding towns and statewide.
Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind



When the owner of the coal plant proposed building a natural gas–burning facility on the site, activists from Salem Alliance for the Environment, or SAFE, were skeptical of replacing one fossil fuel with another. However, they decided not to oppose the plan for a new, smaller plant and to instead push for the rest of the property to be used for an offshore wind port that could both contribute to the decarbonization of the grid and create new opportunities for local residents.


“It wasn’t that we were really supportive of the gas plant, but we had bigger dreams of a wind port coming into town,” said SAFE founder Patricia Gozemba. ​“Our dream played out.”


In 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, announced the state would make a $75 million investment in the port, and the project was also awarded a $34million grant from the federal Port Infrastructure Development Program. Two years later, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center bought 42 acres of the former coal plant property, with the intention of leasing it to energy and marine developer Crowley. The City of Salem acquired five adjacent acres.

The plans enjoyed widespread support in the city.


“We’re a uniquely progressive community,” said SAFE executive director Bonnie Bain. There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.
 A seat at the table


As negotiations between Crowley and the city got underway, SAFE and other groups started to worry that, despite their longstanding advocacy for the project, important community input was missing from the process.


“This wasn’t just a wind port — it was an investment in the community,” Bain said. ​“We want to make sure that when we build projects that they enhance the community.”


Advocates raised their voices, submitting testimony for state and local proceedings, attending planning board meetings, and hosting educational webinars about offshore wind. In 2023, SAFE and several Salem neighborhood associations and civic groups formed a coalition to ask for a seat at the bargaining table as the city and developer hammered out the community benefits agreement.


The coalition was determined to make sure that the project didn’t harm nearby residents and created opportunities for some of the city’s disadvantaged populations. The group met once a week — Thursdays at 4 p.m. — for a year to discuss strategy, write letters to the media, and plan for local and state meetings. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo agreed to include two coalition members — Kelley, representing the Historic Derby Street neighborhood adjacent to the planned port, and Corchado, representing The Point, a largely immigrant, lower-income neighborhood nearby — in the community benefit negotiations.


“We kind of pushed our way to the discussion table to make sure they heard what we were looking for,” Corchado said.


The parties struck a deal that included a range of measures. The city’s public schools were set to receive $40,000 annually for technical and vocational education programs and another $50,000 per year to expand prekindergarten childcare to help parents attend job training. Crowley also committed to offer paid apprenticeships and internships, help graduating students find jobs in the industry, and fund scholarships for local workers to access relevant training opportunities.


When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind. Corchado, however, was concerned from the beginning.


“We were so far along and the funding has already been secured. It was like, maybe it’s not going to be that bad,” she said. ​“But, yeah … it’s what I was worried about.”


The news on Aug. 29 that the federal funding would be terminated was an enormous disappointment for proponents. It also left them with questions about whether the lost funds would scuttle the plan entirely, force the developer to change course, or merely delay implementation. Crowley will say only that it is reviewing the action and determining next steps. The city of Salem is also figuring out what to do now.


“We are still working to pursue all avenues to address the funding termination,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. ​“That includes working to get it restored or, failing that, looking at how we could revise the project plan to account for the loss of what was around 10% of the expected construction costs for the port.”


Community members are feeling somewhat adrift as the concrete plans they invested so much time in become increasingly uncertain.
“It wasn’t necessarily surprising,” Bain said. ​“But it’s still dizzying when it actually happens.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Salem-Gas-Plant.jpg.webp,,,2025-11-11 12:03:39.057264

Campbell. often face long waits for care and denial of claims  when seeking health care through the Veterans Administration.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)(Photo by Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)In March 2024, I had an altercation with people who had broken into my late father’s home. Afterwards, I spent long hours cleaning the property, and when I returned home and went to the ER on post, I learned I had torn several tendons in my right arm as a result of the incident.
Despite months of therapy, my recovery stalled, and it took more than 14 months for the Veterans Administration (VA) to schedule a needed EMG test, which I had to drive to Franklin to receive — an hour away from my home in Clarksville. That was September 2024, and I am still not healed.
When we enlisted in the military, we were proud to serve our country. We never imagined that, after our service, we would have to fight for our own healthcare. We never imagined that we would have to fight to save the lives of my fellow veterans because the system meant to protect us is failing. 
Every day, we find ourselves on the phone preventing veterans from taking their own lives because they cannot access the care they desperately need. Every day, we watch more of our brothers and sisters slip into homelessness because the promises made to them went unfulfilled. This is not how service should be repaid.
Clarksville veterans, like many across the country, are facing a growing crisis in our healthcare and services. Under Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, in partnership with billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the VA targeted 30,000 federal jobs, many held by veterans. Since January 2025, thousands of critical staff, including doctors and nurses, have left the VA, worsening long-standing problems of staffing shortages, wait times and denied claims.
Nine rare cancers tied to burn pit exposure added to VA benefits list

Collins has also attempted to invalidate collective bargaining agreements that protect federal workers in the workplace and impact the quality of our care. Before taking the job, Collins was a major ally of a billionaire-funded effort to further increase reliance of the VA on private healthcare, benefiting corporations instead of investing in our public healthcare system. 
When veterans try to file a claim or even seek a diagnosis at the VA, every step matters. You might have a recurring condition, but after months of waiting, your appointment finally arrives on a day when you happen to feel slightly “okay” or are not showing symptoms due to months of waiting for an appointment. That single “okay” or good day can set you back, forcing you to start the process over again just to get the needed care or continue with the same treatment or medical practice. The VA delivers medical care through a step-by-step escalation process, but these steps are slippery and dimly lit, leading to delayed care for our veterans. 
Now imagine all of this compounded by VA staffing cuts, which cause longer wait times, hours on hold, the loss of key personnel who help veterans access care, and long trips to Nashville to see a specialist, only to have your travel pay denied.
This is the care we subject our veterans to. This is what their service and sacrifices have earned them. Broken promises and broken systems. Elected officials with short-term memory seem to remember veterans only at election time or on Veterans Day. Veterans are left asking: what happened to ‘never forget’?
Calls by Tennessee veterans double after expansion of VA healthcare benefits

Millions of veterans were exposed to burn pits. The VA created the Burn Pit Registry to track and compile data on troops affected by these toxic exposures because, frankly, no one yet knows the long-term impact or the care they will need. A stripped-down VA in the future could be held accountable for failing to provide that care and protect our veterans.
Yet five Tennessee members of Congress, U.S. Reps. Chuck Fleischmann, Mark Green — a graduate of West Point and a veteran —  Diana Harshbarger, David Kustoff and John Rose, voted against the PACT Act, a law designed to provide health care and benefits to veterans exposed to toxic substances. The expansion of our VA clinic in Clarksville is a result of PACT Act funding. 
Veterans are dying every day, be it from illnesses exasperated by long wait times or suicide. Now, on top of that, millions of Americans, including veterans, have also lost their SNAP food benefits. While working people face cuts, the wealthy and corporations won nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. 
Clarksville has always been a proud military town. With Fort Campbell in our backyard, Montgomery County has the highest veteran density in the state. Twenty percent of our residents have served in the military. We are more than veterans. We are your teachers, your pastors, your factory workers and your friends. We raise families, coach Little League, volunteer in our churches, and contribute every day to the life of our community.
When we cannot get an appointment for months or can’t afford our groceries, our health worsens. When our travel pay is denied, we often skip care altogether. When forced into private networks, many of us give up in frustration. The result is not efficiency, it is neglect.
We have sacrificed enough. And our message is clear. Invest in our care, not cuts. 
We have come together to form Veterans For All, organizing in Clarksville to protect our care and reject cuts to vital services. Our platform calls on major Clarksville corporations that receive millions in public subsidies and tax breaks to invest in veteran care, make binding commitments to hire veterans, and treat workers with dignity. It also urges our elected officials to oppose VA cuts and resist a shift toward privatized healthcare.
The veterans we have met in the waiting room at the VA  told us they were not going to stop fighting for their benefits. Neither will we. 
Clarksville’s veterans have never walked away from a fight. Now we are asking you and our leaders not to walk away from us. 
It is time to make a choice. We can continue to reward corporations with massive tax breaks while cutting services for veterans and working families, or we can invest in the people who have already given so much for all of us.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Many food pantries in Ohio are seeing record demand as President Donald Trump has resisted court orders to provide food aid to 42 million Americans.
The outlines of an agreement to end the longest government shutdown in history emerged Sunday night. But it’s unclear how quickly the administration will work to distribute food benefits or in what amounts. 
A federal judge ruled that despite the shutdown, Trump must disburse funds that are available for the purpose. But so far he has refused. 
The matter is before the appellate courts, and the Department of Agriculture on Saturday ordered some states to undo their work to disburse food funds on their own.
On Monday afternoon, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services issued guidance saying that full benefits are unlikely to be provided this month.
“Under the revised federal calculations, nearly all recipients will receive less than 65% of their normal benefit,” it said. 
“Some recipients, particularly those whose earnings place the household near the cutoff for eligibility, may receive no benefits this week under the revised calculation. An official notice explaining each household’s specific benefit change will be issued. After the federal government shutdown ends, additional (federal) guidance will be needed to determine how to handle the difference between what would ordinarily be issued for the month and what is being issued this week.”
Last week, as 1.4 million Ohioans lost their food benefits, record numbers flocked to the state’s food pantries. 
“We had our biggest day ever in history last Wednesday — 285 families in a three-hour period,” Roy Clark, executive director of the NNEMAP food pantry a mile east of the Ohio State campus in Columbus said on Monday. 
About 10 yards away, a constant stream of people made their way through the season’s first snow seeking help. “
We were shoving a lot of food out the door. It’s maintaining close to that every day — even on a day like this.”

A few miles to the south, officials at the pantry at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church were also dealing with unprecedented demand. 
Where they served an average 35 families a day during the pandemic, they were serving nearly 60 in July as Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashed $186 billion over 10 years from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The same law slashes nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while delivering a similar amount of tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans.
As of last week, the Broad Street pantry was serving more than 90 families a day, said Amy Miracle, a pastor at the church. That’s nearly three times the number it was serving during the pandemic.
“The reason the numbers have gone up in the past 10 days is because of the pause in SNAP benefits,” Miracle said. 
“I, like everyone else in the country, have no idea (when benefits will resume.) We just know it’s having a real and immediate impact on families here in Central Ohio.”
Shawn Weatherby, a supervisor at the pantry, said resources have become so strained that it’s been turning away five to 10 visitors a day — something hunger fighters never want to do.
 “It feels bad to me, but at some point in time we have to close the line because we won’t be able to serve everybody,” he said.
Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said that stocking up for the SNAP crisis has been difficult because planners have to balance the need for adequate supplies against not wasting perishable food.
“We are proudly operating on a backbone of generous volunteers and community organizations, many of whom are taking extraordinary steps to expand hours, to help manage traffic flow, to make sure food remains available as they’re serving much higher numbers than normal,” she said. 
Novotny said that with the interruption of federal food benefits, demand at food pantries across the state accelerated rapidly. 
On Thursday, they served 70% more individuals than the average between January and September.
“We are purchasing much more food right now than we ever would normally,” Novotny said. 
“I had a couple food banks tell me they had their busiest day on record for picking orders off their shelves in the warehouse to pile them on to trucks to local food pantries.”

But perhaps surprisingly, food pantries there aren’t facing as big a surge as some counterparts elsewhere in the state, said Mike Iberis, executive director of the Second Harvest Food Bank of Mahoning County. 
The food bank supplies pantries there and in Columbiana and Trumbull counties.
Iberis said that with the interruption of SNAP, demand has increased about 5%.
“We’ve seen an uptick, but we’ve been able to address it,” he said. “We’ve been able to supply the pantries with what they need.”
Clark, of the NNEMAP pantry in Columbus, said it makes more food deliveries than any nonprofit in Ohio — half of them to seniors. 
He said it’s a vital service for people who find it hard to get around, but delivery costs extra.
“Finances are always an issue,” he said, inviting people to donate. “We barely made our budget last year and this year looks to be very tight.”
Novotny of the association of foodbanks said that anyone seeking to volunteer or donate can start at the find your food bank page on her agency’s website. Or they can start even closer to home.
“First things first,” she said. “If you know someone, if you have a personal relationship with a family you can provide direct help to, please consider doing so. It’s neighbor helping neighbor.”
But while inspiring, no charitable effort can replace what SNAP does for the most vulnerable Ohioans, Novotny said.
“This isn’t sustainable,” she said. “SNAP provides over $215 million a month in federally funded food-purchasing power. I’m really proud of what our network was doing before this. We were providing 19 million meals on average per month. But it doesn’t come close to touching what SNAP does to provide a first line of defense.”

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohio will begin distributing partial SNAP benefits as early as Wednesday, the state said late Monday. This comes as the U.S. Senate is set to vote on a continuing resolution to reopen the government.
All recipients who’ve not yet received their November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, as well as individuals who were approved for, but not paid in October, will begin receiving their partial November benefit this week, the Department of Jobs and Family Services said.
ODJFS is required to reduce the maximum amount of SNAP benefits each household can receive in November by 35% and to recalculate each household’s payment based on that new amount. Some recipients may receive no benefits this week, the department said.
And after 41 days of the government being shut down, the Senate finally reached a deal to pass legislation that would provide backpay to federal workers, reverse layoffs and reinstate government benefits.
“We gotta stop thinking this is us against them and remember that we’re here for our country,” U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, a Republican representing District 14, told us earlier in the shutdown.
An official vote is set to take place late Monday.
“Military — those are the men and women who are out there 24 hours a day for us, a lot of them with young families, they’ve got to have support,” U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, a Republican representing District 5, told us in October. “They don’t have it when they don’t have these paychecks.
Joyce and Latta were awaiting a compromise, which came Sunday evening.
But SNAP benefits are still in limbo for 1.4 million Ohioans.
“What’s on my card right now is from last month’s benefits,” said Janiah Gales, a Cleveland resident. “So I’m just trying to hold onto them as best as I can.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, who represents District 13, blames the GOP for the struggles Americans are facing.
“This is a failure of the Congress led by Republicans, the White House led by Republicans and Donald Trump to come together and do the necessary work, the very basic work of funding our United States government,” Sykes told us in an interview last month.
The resolution doesn’t address Sykes’ and the Democratic Party’s main goal — extending subsidies tied to the Affordable Care Act.
This means health care premiums could go up.
“I was clear: any deal that could earn my support needed to lower costs and keep healthcare accessible and affordable. Our local economy relies on healthcare not only for our well-being, but also for jobs and economic growth. This deal does not get us there and leaves thousands of my constituents without healthcare and spending more money to live than they ever have. I will continue to fight to deliver the relief that families in Ohio’s 13th District and across the country deserve,” Sykes said in a statement Monday.
In addition, the nonpartisan research group Center for Community Solutions reports hundreds of thousands of Ohioans will be removed from Medicaid in 2027.
“It’s going to kick off people from their healthcare coverage… specifically for Ohio’s 13th district that relies upon health care systems to employ our neighbors and our friends and our family,” the congresswoman said.
What the Democrats got in this deal was a promise of a vote in the coming weeks on the subsidies.
But Latta doesn’t support them, citing the Affordable Care Act as too expensive.
“They want $1.5 trillion, and now they’re saying the federal debt’s gonna be going up to $38 trillion,” Latta said.
The continuing resolution still has to officially pass the Senate and the House, but it appears likely to go through. It would only last until the end of January.

Applications open Wednesday for 29 total seats on the governing boards of eight South Carolina public universities. Fifteen of those seats are at Coastal Carolina.
A legislative screening panel also is seeking candidates for a number of vacant and expired board positions at The Citadel, the College of Charleston, Lander University, the Medical University of South Carolina, South Carolina State University, the University of South Carolina and Winthrop University. Applications are due no later than noon Dec. 17.

Applicants for the College of Charleston seat must live in the 4th Congressional District.
The opening at MUSC is for a resident of the 2nd Congressional District who does not have a medical background.
Of Lander’s three seats on the list, one represents the 5th Congressional District and two will be filled by the governor. They are “at-large” seats, meaning applicants can live anywhere in the state.
Winthrop has two at-large seats and a 7th Congressional District seat.
USC has two gubernatorial appointed seats, one seat for a resident of the state’s 4th judicial circuit and one for the 15th circuit
One opening each at the Citadel and SC State are at large. The Citadel member must be an alumni.

Still, others will be left out of the oversight measure.
The committee chose to screen applicants for only a portion of the boards’ seats with expired terms.
For example, the Citadel has four members of its board of visitors with expired terms, but the panel opened applications for just one of the positions — an at-large seat held by Col. James Nicholson Jr.

 How to apply
Applicants must fill out all required forms, including:
A letter of intentA personal questionnaireA release allowing the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division to conduct a background checkA release of their driving recordA release allowing the state to conduct a credit reportA statement of their economic holdingsAnd a form acknowledging their applications.
All forms are available on the screening panel’s web page.
Applications must be hand delivered to room 419 of the Blatt Building on the Statehouse grounds by noon, Dec. 17.

Nicholson, who legislators elected to the board in 2019, has continued to sit on the board since his term expired at the end of June 2023.
At Winthrop University, legislators will screen candidates for only one expired position and two vacant seats. However, three other board members are serving expired terms.
Among those vacancies is the seat previously held by Winthrop’s former board chairman, the late Glenn McCall.
The longtime South Carolina GOP leader was York County’s first Black Republican chairman. In 2008, he was elected the state party’s first Black national committeeman. He helped write a 2013 report that called for a more inclusive and diverse GOP. His other roles in the party included vice-chairman for the 2016 Republican National Convention and a committee co-chairman for the 2020 national convention.
He died July 11 from complications from surgery. He was 71.
Screenings at the other five colleges are focused solely on filling vacancies and vetting gubernatorial appointees.
At the College of Charleston, eight other members serving expired terms won’t be required to go through the re-application process. At Lander University six other members appointed by the General Assembly will continue on in expired terms.
MUSC and SC State each have seven members with expired terms not being screened. And USC has five.
Clemson University and Francis Marion University aren’t part of the screening list at all despite having a dozen members with expired terms between them.
Rep. Bill Whitmire, who chairs the committee, said it comes down to time.
The Walhalla Republican said the Legislature fell behind in the process amid lawsuits challenging the state’s congressional districts, redrawn by the Legislature following the 2020 census.
From foster care to fine arts, SC has hundreds of citizen boards and lots of openings to fill

All but Clemson, The Citadel and USC boards’ memberships are determined, at least in part, by congressional district.
USC’s board seats are by judicial circuit. Clemson’s board is partially selected by its existing members and partially appointed by the Legislature to at-large seats. The Citadel board is made up of alumni serving in at-large positions.
With so many college board members serving expired terms, Whitmire said, the panel can’t review them all in one sitting and will try to get caught up at a later date.
Citadel board members in expired terms include former state Rep. Gene Pinson, R-Greenwood; and Col. Peter McCoy Sr., the father of former House Judiciary chairman and U.S. Attorney Peter McCoy.

Barfoot winning the Medal of Honor included killing seven Germans and capturing 17 while helping to save the lives of fellow soldiers.,"Among the Mississippians honored on Veterans Day are 28 Medal of Honor recipients. Among those is Van T. Barfoot.
After a day dodging land mines, facing tanks and taking prisoners, U.S. Army Col. Barfoot led his squad to victory against German forces in Italy in 1944. His actions that day earned him a Medal of Honor as told in the graphic novel from the Association of the United States Army.
The book is part of a series called Medal of Honor, which tells the stories of Army veterans who’ve received the highest honor in the U.S. Armed Forces for valor from the Civil War to the present.
According to Joseph Craig, director of AUSA’s book program, over half a million people read the first six volumes.
Craig wrote that Bartfoot’s life was “exciting and inspiring — a classic WWII hero’s tale full of action.”
Van T Barfoot Credit: United States Army
Barfoot’s story began in Edinburg, an unincorporated community in Leake County in east central Mississippi, where he was one of eight siblings. He enlisted in the Army in 1940. In 1943, he began fighting in Europe as part of the 3rd Platoon, Company L, 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Division.
On May 23, 1944, Barfoot’s unit was facing off against German forces near Carano, Italy. Alone, Barfoot navigated across a minefield to the enemy’s left flank. He took out a machine gun nest with a hand grenade, killing two Germans and wounding three. He then entered a German trench, where he killed two more soldiers and took the remaining ones as prisoners.
Barfoot and his men then took control of more German positions. He reorganized his men and consolidated their new ground.
Later that day, three German tanks launched a counterattack. Barfoot single-handedly disabled the first tank with a bazooka, then killed three of the tank’s crew. The other two tanks fled. Barfoot’s group advanced and destroyed an abandoned German artillery piece. Later, he helped two wounded men cross 1,700 yards of enemy territory to reach safety. 
In total, he killed seven Germans and captured 17 that day.
Barfoot received a Medal of Honor on Sept. 28, 1944, in Épinal, France. He continued serving in the Army, fighting in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Later in his career, he worked as a senior national adviser to the Army National Guard. He retired from the Army in 1974 as a colonel.
He received national attention in 2009 when his homeowners association in Virginia tried to force him to take down the flagpole in his yard. The association backed down after the dispute reached national headlines, with public opinion mostly on Barfoot’s side.
Barfoot was 92 when he died in 2012.
Each book in the Medal of Honor series is made by professional comic book writers and artists, with vetting by historians. They’re part of AUSA’s educational mission.
People can read them online for free, and AUSA premium members can order paperback collections at the end of every year.
A basic membership is free, and paid memberships contribute to AUSA’s mission of supporting the U.S. Army.
“We get a great response from the public, including many suggestions for people to feature in new issues,” Craig said. “I have also heard from a few relatives, which is particularly rewarding.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10151100/MoH_Van-T-Barfoot_COVER-e1762809214873.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

(Submitted by Eric Thomas)TOPEKA — The Kansas City Chiefs put out a request for proposals to design a new stadium on the Kansas side of the state line with Missouri and are negotiating for land near the Kansas Speedway, according to two reports from Kansas City area talk show hosts. 
Pete Mundo of KCMO talk radio broke the news that the Chiefs contacted multiple firms regarding a new stadium to be built at Interstate 435 and Interstate 70. He said the news was confirmed by several sources.
Mundo stressed that the RFP didn’t mean the Chiefs had selected Kansas as the location for a new stadium and added that his “gut” said they would stay in Missouri. 
On Monday, Kevin Kietzman said on his podcast that the Chiefs are in negotiations with NASCAR and the state of Kansas to acquire land just west of the Kansas Speedway. He said the Chiefs also may be building a hotel by the Hollywood Casino and creating an entertainment district. 
“NASCAR owns a total of 880 acres of land at Village West, folks,” Kietzman said. “They only use 300 of them.”
Patrick Lowry, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce, said major development projects require confidentiality and the agency has no comment on negotiations regarding the stadium. 
“Kansas Department of Commerce continues to conduct a careful analysis of costs and benefits as part of crafting agreements to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the region while maximizing growth opportunities for Kansas,” Lowry said.
The Kansas Legislature agreed to finance up to 70% of the project, with a minimum $1 billion price tag, by issuing bonds to be repaid with sales tax collected in the STAR Bond district. 
 
Wyandotte opportunity
The possibility of moving the Chiefs stadium across the state line has both excited and concerned Kansas leaders. In Wyandotte County, where the Village West area is located, an economic development leader is hesitant to talk about what the stadium might bring to his county, although he’s positive that location would be a strong one for the Chiefs. 
“I think that area is the No. 1 tourist destination in the state of Kansas,” said Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council. “There’s infrastructure and highway infrastructure. We know there’s an ability to get people in and out of major sporting events, and if we can put a deal together that works for everybody, it’s a win-win.”
Much still needs to be assessed in terms of the economic development benefits for Wyandotte County. 
“We’re still working through the economics of it,” Kindle said. “It has to be revenue development that works for the sports teams but also drives revenue into the community. On the front end, it’s super exciting to have a national sports team in your community because you get a lot of branding, you get more tourism, you get people who are excited about being near that environment.”
Kindle referred to the success of the Kansas Speedway and Sporting KC, both of which are in the area and hold numerous events all year. 
“Tourism areas benefit,” he said. “New things have to be happening. This would be an interesting additional asset to the area that we hope would bring in additional hotels and restaurants and interest in that area.”
Kindle said the negotiations with the Chiefs are going on through state officials and Wyandotte has offered support as needed. He’s excited about the idea the team may come to his county, but he also wants to encourage everyone to think long-term.
“They’ve been in their current location for what, 50 or 60 years. We want to make sure that whatever happens here builds on what they’ve done and the success that they’ve had, but also that we ensure that we do, in fact, get that ancillary growth that goes with the project,” Kindle said. 
 
Stadium investments
J.C. Bradbury, an economist and professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, is releasing a book next year titled “This One Will be Different: False Promises and Fiscal Realities of Publicly Funded Stadiums.” 
He said economic justifications for putting tax dollars behind stadium development don’t hold up.
Economists look at economic development differently than other professionals, who consider the process about increasing business activity in a community, Bradbury said.
“Economists use the term economic development to describe improving economic outcomes. And stadiums are absolutely not true economic development catalysts,” he said.
Bradbury said he has looked for studies that show there is an economic benefit to stadiums and hasn’t found one.
“If you went and called a doctor for a study on the dangers of smoking, you wouldn’t be able to find a doctor who would say smoking is good for you, right?” Bradbury said. “If you would ask economists about the economic benefits of stadiums, you probably couldn’t find an economist who would say that they’re beneficial. But no one wants to listen to economists on that.”
Multiple changes happen in communities when stadiums are built that lead people to believe the economy benefits, he said. Increased spending definitely happening around the stadium, but Bradbury said that spending is pulled from restaurants and stores not in the stadium’s entertainment sphere. 
Other factors include being unable to track businesses that don’t open up in a stadium district, such as doctor’s offices and retail stores, because of traffic and people who don’t want to live near stadiums, he said. 
“There’s actually some negative spillover effects that no one likes to talk about,” Bradbury said. He gave an example of an area in Atlanta that was near where stadiums were formerly located. For years, it was a “ghost town,” but after stadiums moved, it is now a thriving commercial district.
There are positives, including the novelty effect when the stadium first opens, Bradbury said. 
“This is a private business that largely benefits the owners of the team. It’s generating hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars,” Bradbury said. “Athletes are paid millions of dollars of salaries. These organizations exist as economic entities because they’re profitable. There’s zero justification for taxpayers putting a dime for professional sports stadiums, but we just sort of got in the habit of doing that, and now I’m hoping to try to break this habit.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221122-Chiefs-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

The Trump administration is planning an oil and gas lease sale in federal territory of the inlet.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Trump administration on Monday outlined its plans to auction 1 million acres of federal offshore territory in what it has called the “Big Beautiful Cook Inlet Oil and Gas Lease Sale.”
The lease sale, to be held early next year under terms detailed in a notice published Monday in the Federal Register, is to be the first of at least six mandated for Cook Inlet through 2032 under the sweeping budget bill that Congress passed this summer. The bill also mandated 30 lease sales through 2040 in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
“President Trump’s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked the beginning of a new chapter for oil and gas development in the Gulf of America and Alaska’s Cook Inlet,” Matt Giacona, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said in a news release issued Friday. “BOEM is now moving forward with a predictable, congressionally mandated leasing schedule that will support offshore oil and gas development for decades to come.”
In the statement, the agency, which is the Department of the Interior division that oversees offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters, touted the 12.5% royalty offered in the lease sale as an incentive to bidders. The agency statement noted that 12.5% is the lowest royalty rate allowed for offshore oil and gas production in federal territory.
Lease sale bids are to be opened on March 4.
Cook Inlet lease sales held in recent years, whether in federal or state territory, have drawn little industry interest. That is despite the use of some incentives, such as royalty-free terms.
There are only eight active leases in federal waters of Cook Inlet, all held by Hilcorp, the inlet’s dominant operator. One of those leases was acquired in a sale held at the end of 2022 under a requirement inserted into the Inflation Reduction Act; Hilcorp’s bid was the only one in that lease sale.
Hilcorp also was the sole bidder in a 2017 federal Cook Inlet lease sale, when it acquired 14 leases. Last year, it relinquished seven of those leases.

	There is no pending exploration plan for Hilcorp’s eight federal Cook Inlet leases, according to the BOEM website.
Muted industry interest in past sales
Annual areawide Cook Inlet lease sales held by the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas, for both offshore and onshore state territory, have also produced few bids in recent years.
The 2025 state sale drew five bids, according to results released by the division in June. The 2024 sale drew three bids. The 2023 state sale drew six bids. Each sale offered more than 700 tracts spread over about 3 million acres, and in two of those lease sales, Hilcorp was the sole bidder.
For the upcoming federal lease Cook Inlet lease sale, rules used in the 2017 federal sale will apply, BOEM said.
The agency’s Federal Register notice kicked off a 60-day comment period — but only for Alaska’s governor and for local governments. It is unclear whether tribal governments or any other organizations are included among those invited to comment; a question posed to the Department of the Interior press office was not answered by Monday afternoon.
An automatic emailed message from BOEM spokesperson Jennifer Russo said she could not respond to questions on Monday because of the federal government shutdown.
One environmental group that opposes the lease sale plans to submit public comments nonetheless.
“They’re not asking for comments from the public. But we are still planning to make sure that the people who live in Cook Inlet and Alaska and around the country, their voices will be heard,” said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director of the Center for Biological Diversity.
There appears to be no prohibition on public comments, Freeman noted.
Even though recent Cook Inlet lease sales have drawn little industry interest, he said the center has worries about future leasing.
“We hope that there’s no bids, but we’re taking it very seriously,” he said. “All it takes is one drill rig, one pipeline to burst, and it would be over for the inlet.”
The upcoming Cook Inlet lease sale process is separate from a court-mandated review of the 2022 lease sale.
A lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and other organizations resulted in a federal court ruling last year that found the presale analysis to be flawed. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ordered BOEM to conduct further analysis of leasing impacts to endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales and other natural resources.
BOEM, in a Federal Register notice published in September, said it plans to complete the supplemental impact statement by the end of the year.
The agency said that it will not release the draft study for public comment and will hold no public hearings on the draft, a departure from procedures followed in past environmental studies.
The lack of public comment opportunities or planned public hearings has angered some Cook Inlet area organizations.
Cook Inletkeeper, an environmental group, has launched a petition drive calling for the normal public process to be reinstated.

(Photo by Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images for Heineken)The capitulation by a handful of moderate Senate Democrats, including Nevada’s two senators, to end the government shutdown came days after Nevada resort and tourism officials sided with the White House position on reopening the government.
Nevada’s Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who had been voting with Republicans from the start, and Sen. Jacky Rosen joined Republicans to approve a package Monday that restores pay and protections for federal workers harmed during the shutdown, but doesn’t deliver on the extension of the health care tax credits Democrats had been holding out for. 
Rosen had held out since Oct. 1 for a commitment from Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, but received no such assurances in the end. 
Throughout the shutdown Republicans said they would negotiate on ACA premiums only if Democrats surrendered and voted for the the Republican spending resolution bill. 
Last month, noting the control President Donald Trump has exhibited over congressional Republicans, Rosen said taking Trump and Republicans at their word when “they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part.” 
What’s changed, according to a statement from Rosen this week, is Republicans “weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt.”
Rosen’s capitulation comes days after outreach from the tourism industry to congressional and White House leaders. 
With Thanksgiving approaching, “the consequences of a continued shutdown will be immediate, deeply felt by millions of American travelers, and economically devastating to communities in every state,” the U.S. Travel Association, representing hundreds of travel-related companies, including Caesars Entertainment, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, MGM Resorts International, and the Venetian Casino Resort, wrote to congressional leaders last week.
“We urge Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the federal government,” the letter said, echoing the position reiterated by the Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders throughout the shutdown. 
The LVCVA “informed Senator Rosen that we planned to sign U.S. Travel’s letter to congressional leaders, which was issued last week, and shared its general content with her in advance,” says Vice President of Public Relations and Communications Molly Castano. 
Castano, in an email to the Current, noted the approach of “peak travel season,” including the Formula 1 race, National Finals Rodeo, and New Year’s Eve. “Maintaining stable staffing levels for TSA, FAA, and CBP (Customs and Border Enforcement) is essential to ensuring the smooth flow of holiday travel and major events that drive our economy.”
“No other state in the country is as dependent on the travel and tourism industry as Nevada,”   the LVCVA, the Las Vegas Chamber, and the Nevada Resort Association wrote in a joint letter to U.S. Secretary of Travel Sean Duffy, adding they share Duffy’s “commitment to ensuring safe and reliable air travel and stand ready to collaborate with you to find balanced, practical solutions. However, we respectfully urge that our nation’s air service continue without reductions. Any reduction in service will reverberate far beyond Nevada — threatening jobs, small businesses and economic activity nationwide.”
The letter, dated Nov. 7, was copied to all of Nevada’s congressional delegates. 
American Airlines, a major carrier at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, expressed gratitude in a news release to Cortez Masto and Rosen “for their leadership.” 
The airline noted “for 40 days, federal aviation workers haven’t been paid, and our customers have endured thousands of delays and cancellations due to the government shutdown. It’s imperative that we get the hardworking aviation safety and security professionals paid, and that we get the country moving again.”
In statements, Cortez Masto and Rosen framed their decision as a pragmatic step to end the 40-day government shutdown while securing a promise from Republicans that they will take up a vote on extending the Affordable Care Act’s tax credits.
Republicans have refused to negotiate extensions to health insurance premium subsidies for people insured through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) until the government is reopened. Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike, though the increases could be far greater for many Nevadans.
Republicans say they will hold the promised vote to extend health care tax credits by mid-December. Passage of the extension is highly unlikely, but the Democrats making the deal with Republicans argue it will once again put Senate Republicans on the record on extending ACA tax credits.
Lee and Horsford mum
The bill still needs approval from the Republican-controlled House and the signature of the president before the shutdown ends. Trump has indicated he’ll sign it.
Many House Democrats, including Nevada Rep. Dina Titus, slammed the deal. Titus said she would “oppose the continuing resolution again for the same reasons I did earlier.”
“Senate passage of the continuing resolution without extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies means thousands of Nevadans will lose their health insurance because they won’t be able to afford it,” Titus said.
“We have endured weeks of pain from a government shutdown – including cutting off SNAP benefits and not paying federal workers – for nothing. Nevadans will see their health insurance premiums double or triple, leaving many with no choice but to drop their coverage,” she continued.
Nevada Democratic Reps. Steven Horsford and Susie Lee did not respond to questions on how they plan to vote once the bill gets to the House.
Some progressive organizations in Nevada were more forthcoming.
Make the Road Nevada said they were “deeply disappointed in Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen for supporting the continuing resolution that fails to meet the real needs of working families.”
“This agreement does nothing to resolve the ongoing attacks on the Affordable Care Act,” said Jen Fleischmann Willoughby, director of development at Make The Road Nevada. “Our communities deserve lasting protections, not short-term compromises.”
Shelbie Swartz, the executive director of Battle Born Progress, also criticized the decision by Cortez Masto and Rosen to join Republicans in reopening “the government without a concrete fix for expiring ACA premium subsidies.”
Swartz added that the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – which provides food assistance for 500,000 Nevadans – put Nevada’s “senators into a difficult position.”
“We cannot allow the Trump administration to pit SNAP recipients against families who need affordable health coverage—Nevadans deserve both,” Swartz said. “ACA premiums are increasing in real time, and without the subsidy extension, many Nevadans will lose coverage altogether.”
Republicans say they will hold the vote to extend health care tax credits by mid-December. Passage of the extension is doubtful at most, but the Democrats making the deal with Republicans argue it will at least put Senate Republicans on the record. 
The final version of the deal would extend government funding through January 2026.
The bill still needs approval from the House and the signature of the president before the shutdown ends.
In addition to reinstating all federal employees dismissed and furloughed during the shutdown, the bill also prohibits further layoffs through the end of January, when the continuing spending resolution would expire.
The length of the shutdown has had significant economic impacts on federal workers and industries that rely on those federal workers. In Nevada, nearly 14,000 federal workers have gone without a paycheck since the government shutdown.
“Most Americans wouldn’t continue showing up to work for 41 days without a paycheck, and we’re deeply grateful to those who did,” said Nevada State AFL-CIO’s executive secretary-treasurer Susie Martinez.
Martinez said she was “relieved to see movement toward reopening the government.” Referring to federal workers who have not been getting paid Marintinez said she is also “encouraged that this legislative package includes critical support that help working people afford food and health care.”
“That said, this shutdown should have never happened. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, contractors, and those in the industries that depend on them have been forced to go weeks without pay or face job insecurity because of political brinkmanship. In Nevada that means families struggling to pay rent, feed their children, and keep up with the rising costs of living,” Martinez said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1804681979-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

Another 6,000 could lose benefits in the coming months. 
The bill disqualifies refugees, people who have been granted asylum and other humanitarian immigrants from receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
As a result, families who have already missed November SNAP payments due to the ongoing federal government shutdown are staring down reduced food budgets that will outlast the current gridlock in Washington.
People who lose eligibility because they are in an affected group cannot re-qualify for SNAP until they have held lawful permanent residence, commonly known as a green card, for 5 years, said Chris Moreland, director of communications for the state’s social services department.
Syed Yousuf Hussain, case manager for ICNA Relief Missouri, a Muslim faith-based charity in St. Louis, said the center’s food pantry has seen a 20% increase in attendance since SNAP payments were suspended on Nov. 1. Of the 90 families the food pantry serves each month, Hussain said, most are refugees, from countries including Afghanistan, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela and Colombia, but the food pantry is open to anyone in need, regardless of their immigration status or religion.
“Many families, they’re suddenly left with a big question mark, how to cope up with the situation when suddenly the benefits have been drastically reduced,” Hussain said.
Students at a mosque in St. Louis receive backpacks filled with school essentials as part of outreach efforts by ICNA Relief Missouri (photo submitted).
Joan Kelly, director of strategic partnerships at Jewish Vocational Services of Kansas City, a nonprofit that aids refugees, said she expects 170 of the families her organization serves to lose benefits. Of these, she said 78% have at least one working family member and 75% have children.
“In a family that is working, and working really hard, these are really challenging conversations that we are having with folks already to say, ‘I don’t know how we’re going to make your budget work,’” Kelly said. “You’re already working. Your wife is working. You can’t really just walk in and say, ‘Hey boss, I lost my SNAP benefits. Can I get a raise?’”
Members of these groups have long been the exception to federal restrictions on immigrants’ access to safety-net programs. 
Adults living in the U.S. without legal status are not eligible for SNAP, though they can apply and get benefits for members of their household who meet requirements, such as children born in the U.S. 
Since 1996, federal law has required most immigrants with green cards to wait 5 years before they can qualify, even if they meet all other requirements applied to U.S. citizens.
Adriana Cadena, executive director of Protecting Immigrant Families, a national coalition of groups that advocates for low-income immigrants, said the new exclusions mark a departure from longstanding U.S. policy.
“In the past, there would be this sort of division among different types of immigrants in this country,” Cadena said. “Right now, the attack is on everyone.”
 A key tool for self-sufficiency

Advocates said that while many refugees are eager to support themselves and their families without assistance, SNAP is a key tool for clients to meet basic needs during their early days in the U.S.
“Some of them are just gung-ho, ‘I don’t want any of this orientation stuff. Just get me a job. I want to support my family,’” Paul Costigan, state refugee coordinator at the Missouri Office of Refugee Administration.
Hussain said that in addition to food, the ICNA center in St. Louis provides English language and financial literacy courses, resume and job interview support, and mental health services. ICNA Relief USA provides a broader array of services throughout the country, including disaster relief, transitional housing and support for students.
“One can understand when somebody is coming here in the beginning, much more support is needed,” Hussain said, “but we try our best to make them fully self-reliant as soon as possible.”
For some refugees still using SNAP, Kelly said, the prospect of going to a food pantry after taking steps toward self-sufficiency is demoralizing.
“We have clients that have said, ‘I’ve stood in line for food my entire life. The thought of going to a pantry and standing for food again is untenable,’” Kelly said.
 Changing eligibility during the shutdown

Baylee Watts, media director for the state’s social services department, said in an email that 3,651 individuals are expected to lose SNAP benefits because they belong to one of the impacted groups. Another 6,052 could lose eligibility after further examination of their cases.
The department has been updating its systems during the government shutdown to apply SNAP eligibility changes.
Watts said the department is working on implementing the new eligibility rules for refugees and other humanitarian immigrants in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Once the updates are complete, the department will notify impacted people and “issue the necessary adverse action notices.” 
The changes will then apply to current recipients’ cases at their next annual recertification, or when they submit a change to the department, Watts said. 
The federal law also excludes refugees, asylees and some other groups from eligibility for Medicaid, the nation’s health insurance program for low-income people, beginning October 2026.
Meanwhile, some advocates said it remains unclear which groups of humanitarian immigrants will lose eligibility for SNAP and how many families they work with will be affected. 
Costigan said new restrictions may apply mostly to refugees who entered the country in late 2024 or January 2025.
New arrivals of refugees have all but halted since Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program in late January. Refugees must live in the U.S. for one year before they can apply for a green card.
“It may just be a small number of people who have come in over the last year who have not adjusted their status yet, because it hasn’t been the one year mark,” Costigan said.
 Supporting families

Cadena, of Protecting Immigrant Families, said her group has been working since January to understand the Trump administration’s policy changes on immigration and who is still eligible to receive help.
“What are the actual changes?” Cadena said. “Because a lot of this as well is about creating fear in keeping people from not accessing services they are really eligible for.”
Cadena noted that households with children who are U.S. citizens can qualify for SNAP benefits, regardless of the status of their parents.
The state social services department confirmed this.
Watts said that when an individual loses eligibility due to membership in one of the affected groups, “the household would still receive benefits for members of the household that meet citizenship requirements.”
Hussain said that although he expects more families to visit the food pantry in the coming months, donations have increased, and the center is coordinating with local partners to reach more households and supplementing food distribution with meal deliveries.
“We are trying to support our clients in the best way possible, regardless of the legal situation,” Hussain said. “This is something secondary, but our primary objective is to support those families.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/icnarelief-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

Gavin Newsom attracted national news coverage thanks to Proposition 50 before jetting to Brazil for a climate conference President Donald Trump avoided.,"Gov. Gavin Newsom still insists he hasn’t decided to run for president in 2028. But after persuading California’s voters to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts to grab more Democratic seats, he embarked on a flurry of appearances that had the distinct aroma of a political campaign.
He did an interview on CNN, jetted off to Texas to crow about California’s passage of the Proposition 50 gerrymander at a rally of Democrats — some chanted about a 2028 candidacy — and then headed to Brazil as the self-appointed U.S. delegate to a climate change conference boycotted by President Donald Trump.
Oh yes, and Penguin Random House announced that in February, it will release Newsom’s memoir of growing up in San Francisco, founding a business and segueing into politics, titled “Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery.”  It will cost just $30.
No presidential campaign is complete without an autobiography describing how the candidate overcame barriers of birth and circumstance to become a dedicated public servant.
As Newsom surfaced in Brazil on Monday, Politico journalist Camille von Kaenel filed this analysis of the governor’s purpose:
“The California governor’s task at United Nations climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week isn’t to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It’s to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump’s rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up — perhaps under a President Newsom.”
There is, however, a subtext to Newsom’s claim to be a climate change warrior. In recent months, he’s tiptoed away from the aggressive decarbonization programs he had championed earlier, clearly trying to minimize impacts — particularly costs — on consumers. Living costs loomed large in last year’s presidential campaign.
One example is Newsom’s effort to stop the planned decommission of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and several gas-fired generators in Southern California, when it became evident that taking them off-line could lead to shortages in electrical power and potential blackouts.
Another is this year’s 180-degree flip on the petroleum industry. Newsom had spent months demonizing refiners for price-gouging, but when two refineries announced plans to shut down, raising the possibility of sharp gasoline price hikes, Newsom shifted to maintaining fuel supplies and encouraging oil production to stave off imports.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”
Still another example is what happened just a few days ago in Southern California. After years of squabbling over carbon emissions from ships and equipment at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the logistics industry and the regional air quality board appointed by Newsom reached a compromise.
The ports are a major source of emissions in the smog-sensitive region and the South Coast Air Quality Management District had been pressing them to shift from gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment to electricity. Cargo handlers complained that expensive retrofits could make the ports uncompetitive in global trade, potentially threatening thousands of jobs.
The agreement requires a three-phase, multi-year transition to zero-emission machinery, which disturbs environmental advocates and even some board members. Opponents who wanted immediate action chanted their displeasure and were removed from the meeting before the vote.
“The give-and-take of ideas and compromises in this process — it mirrors exactly what a real-world transition to zero emissions looks like,” said William Bartelson, an executive at the Pacific Maritime Association. “It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025-Newsom-Houston-JF-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

A second student seat is a non-voting “designate.” To increase student representation, UC student leaders are pushing for the second seat to also have voting power.","In summary
Of the 26 UC Regents, one student position has voting power. A second student seat is a non-voting “designate.” To increase student representation, UC student leaders are pushing for the second seat to also have voting power. 


The University of California serves 300,000 students, yet only one of the two students on the 26-member Board of Regents is allowed to vote. Now, student leaders are campaigning for a second vote, saying it would better ensure that UC policy reflects all students.
Regents are the top decision-makers of the UC system, and set policies for all campuses, including tuition increases. When one student has to represent the wishes of the entire student population, some feel other perspectives miss out. Last year, when one student regent voted in favor of raising nonresident tuition, the other student regent disagreed, but couldn’t vote on it. 
Currently, the non-voting student spends the first year on the board as a “regent-designate.” That student then moves into the voting position the following year. The students are selected from an applicant pool of all UC graduate and undergraduate students and approved by the board. 
By adding a second vote for student regents, UC would follow in the footsteps of the other two public higher education systems in the state. Legislation passed earlier this decade enabled voting power for two student representatives on the California State University and California Community College governing boards. 
UC board policy, by contrast, cannot be changed through a legislative bill, but could be changed by measures voted on by the regents, or by a constitutional amendment approved by both the Legislature and California voters. Unlike Cal State and community colleges, the UC was established by the state constitution as a system that governs itself with very limited legislative oversight. An attorney general once likened the Board of Regents to a branch of state government, equal to the legislative, judiciary and executive. 
If they choose to go for the amendment, student advocates would like to see it passed by the end of next year’s legislative session so the measure can appear on the November 2026 midterm elections ballot.
Student advocates take the lead
Current student regent Sonya Brooks, a doctoral student in education policy at UCLA, began her voting tenure in July, when she voted in a committee meeting against allowing the UC president to raise professional degree tuition. The committee voted to recommend the president be given this authority, with six in favor and three against. The full board then voted to affirm the authority. 
“I’ve always been an advocate for all things justice,” Brooks said. “Now, because of this position and the opportunities that are available, I’ve really taken advantage to really help not only students… but also faculty and staff.”

Miguel Craven, an energy systems graduate student at UC Davis, is shadowing Brooks this year as the non-voting student regent. He was UC Merced’s student government senator and president during undergrad, while also serving as a student observer to the regents. 
He hopes to act as a bridge between students and regents, in a system that can structurally feel hard for students to participate in.
“It’s not so much that the institution consults the students,” Craven said. “The reality is, it’s the other way: the students have to consult the institution… It’s up to the students to make that effort.”
Every year, the UC Student Association, a coalition of UC students and student governments, conducts a civic engagement campaign called UCweVOTE to teach students about electoral processes and encourage them to vote. This year, to boost student power on the Board of Regents, they are taking the lead in advocating for voting rights for the second student regent. 
Aditi Hariharan, the association’s president and a fifth-year nutrition and political science double major at UC Davis, wants to see a broader range of student voices and backgrounds represented that cannot be captured in just one vote.
“The need for this campaign is the fact that students aren’t a monolith,” said Hariharan. “Not every student views issues the same.”

Advocates believe a second voting student can also give weight to the student voice on more than one of the regents’ 10 committees. Regent committees often meet concurrently, meaning the voting student regent can only cast votes at one of them. 
Committee deliberations often have big impacts on regent decisions, says former student regent Alexis Zaragoza. Non-voting student regents can attend committee meetings and contribute to discussions, but Zaragoza noted even this ability is not protected in policy. She wishes it was.
“If you have two student votes… maybe the other student votes a different way, right?” Zaragoza said. “And it kind of just shows, maybe students are actually kind of split on this issue, maybe your different backgrounds contribute in different ways. It no longer puts that pressure on one student to represent an entire populace.” 
One issue on which students and student regents sometimes disagree is tuition. At the November 2024 regent meeting, the board, including Josiah Beharry, the student regent at the time, voted to increase nonresident tuition. 
At the meeting, multiple students raised concerns about the tuition increase, including Craven as a student observer, who said the increase would limit accessibility at the UC by making the university less affordable for out-of-state and international students. 
The two students were “not in agreement” on this issue, Brooks recalled. After the vote, Beharry asked Brooks how she would have voted in his shoes. She told him she would have voted against the increase. Beharry has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
A trip through the Legislature
In 2021, former Sen. Steve Glazer, a Democrat from Orinda in the East Bay, introduced Senate Constitutional Amendment 5, which would have required the creation of a second voting student regent. The Assembly Appropriations Committee determined that the amendment’s costs to the UC would be “minor and absorbable.” 
However, Glazer told CalMatters that the committee decided the amendment would not progress, without specifying a reason.
In 1974, a constitutional amendment approved by California voters gave the board permission to have a student regent. The regents added the position in 1975. Then, in 1993, the regents created the regent-designate position by voting on a policy, without a constitutional amendment. 
According to an assembly committee analysis of Glazer’s amendment, a constitutional amendment is not required to add a second student voter. This time around, the student association is considering simply proposing a policy change for the board to vote on rather than a constitutional amendment.
If the student association decides to go the amendment route, they would need a legislator to sponsor the bill, which would need the approval of several committees, a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and a simple majority of votes in a statewide election. 
As with Glazer’s amendment, students say the change in voting power will not directly lead to extra costs for the university, because both student regents already attend all meetings on the UC’s dime. It would be a simple transition from a non-voting to a voting role.

Some students do still see value in having a non-voting student regent build understanding during the first year before receiving voting power. Brooks is an active participant at bi-monthly regent meetings, asking questions, chatting with students, and engaging in debates with other regents. But when she joined the board, “I didn’t know A to Z,” she said. “If I didn’t have that one year to grow, to meet people, to form these organic relationships… I would have completely been lost.”
All regents, including student regents, complete the same orientation. These training sessions teach them board policies and logistics, and include briefings with board leaders. So when student regents join the board, they know what they’re getting into, Zaragoza said. 
None of the 18 regents appointed by the governor responded to CalMatters’ requests for comment on this story. The other seven members are “ex officio,” having regental power by virtue of another office they hold, such as the governor and Assembly speaker. These members don’t always attend regent meetings.
Craven thinks that a second student voter isn’t the sole solution to the lack of student representation. He’s interested in ways to expand student advocacy at the regents beyond the positions that exist. 
“What does student representation mean?” Craven said. “Does that mean somebody who’s actually voting, who sits on the board? Do we want to provide an additional space for students to be able to speak?… It’s a discussion that has to happen.”
On Nov. 19, the regents will vote whether to re-affirm annual tuition increases for incoming groups of students, which was first implemented in 2021. Brooks said few students have shared concerns with her over the increases, but she plans to seek them out and talk to them.
“I will continue to reach out to students and vote accordingly,” Brooks said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091725_UCRegents_FM_CM_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

Today in Maryland, they are thrown into adult prisons. The state must do better by those youth, living and dead, write Vincent Schiraldi and Marc Schindler.","A fallen gravestone, marked only with the initials J.B., in the woods that have overtaken a graveyard for Black youth in Cheltenham. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Recent news of a long-abandoned burial site near Maryland’s House of Reformation for Colored Children – a Blacks-only youth prison opened in 1873 to remove youth from adult prisons – has sparked much-needed grappling with the state’s legacy of disparate treatment of youth of color and laws that disproportionately prosecute Black children as adults. This comes against the backdrop of actions by President Donald Trump to erase uncomfortable history, as well as to prosecute 14-year-olds as adults in Washington, D.C.
Between the 1880s and 1939 there were likely more than 230 children buried, in mostly unmarked graves, in a wooded area adjacent to the House of Reformation in Cheltenham. Before its opening, Black youth, some as young as 5, were sent to Maryland’s adult prisons. The House of Reformation opened nearly two decades after the House of Refuge – the reform school established in Baltimore to remove white children from Maryland’s adult prisons.
While records mostly cite disease as the youths’ cause of death, reporting at the time reveals violence, gross neglect and cover-ups. It appears families of the boys who died were rarely, if ever, notified. State officials were aware of the site as far back as the 1970s, but nothing was done to preserve it, even when the adjacent area was turned into an appropriately dignified cemetery for Maryland veterans.
So more than 200 Black youth, buried in unmarked graves with officials aware of the situation going back 50 years, but doing nothing. This scandal presents, as Legislative Black Caucus Chair Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) urged on a recent site visit with caucus members, “an opportunity to take action.”

Fortunately, through work done under the Moore administration and recent actions of elected officials, it appears there will finally be steps taken to address these issues.
Since locating the burial site in October 2024, the Department of Juvenile Services began plans to restore, recognize and maintain it, including: applying for funds for a ground-penetrating radar survey to discern how many boys are buried there; restoring the area as an official cemetery identifying the buried boys; attempting to communicate with the boys’ families; partnering with nonprofit groups and descendants to recognize the cemetery’s history; and creating a dignified process to address the harms against them. This was part of a larger initiative we launched to document the segregationist history of juvenile justice in Maryland under the belief that, to change the system, we had to grapple with the past, even if that was uncomfortable.
When the burial site was revealed in July, Senate Judicial Proceedings Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery) called to rehabilitate the grounds with dignity. In stark contrast to proposals to try 14-year-olds as adults in neighboring D.C., Smith also announced he would reintroduce legislation to curb Maryland’s practice of automatically trying so many youth as adults, a reform recently endorsed by the state’s juvenile justice commission. As Smith said then, “Segregation was terrible. Secretly burying young people in unmarked graves is indefensible. But at least the leaders of that day were taking young people out of adult jails and prisons.”
Arguments in favor of Smith’s approach – and against Trump’s – are strong.  Maryland currently incarcerates a higher percentage of its youth in adult jails and prisons than any state except Alabama. The department calculated it cost nearly $20 million annually just to hold youths while they are processed in slow-moving adult courts to decide whether they stay in adult court or are returned to juvenile court. About 85% of cases were either returned to juvenile court or dismissed, begging the question of how this approach makes sense.
Additionally, research shows that prosecuting youth in the adult system not only fails to  contribute to public safety, it results in more crime. Youth prosecuted as adults are more likely to reoffend and to do so in a violent manner than similar youth kept in juvenile court. Youth held in the adult system are also more likely to be sexually assaulted and to attempt suicide.
And like the double-standard that existed when Maryland operated segregated facilities, the state’s “autowaiver” law is not affecting all children equally.  Nine out of 10 youth charged as adults are youth of color; 80% are Black.
A century ago, poor Black youth were thrown away and buried in unmarked graves. We need to acknowledge this painful history, learn from it and atone for those harms. Today the system throws them away into adult prisons despite evidence that that is ineffective and unfair.  We must do better to honor these youths’ legacies and change our laws to reflect what data shows will improve public safety, save money, and create a more equitable system.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cheltenham-headstone-9-23-2025-cropped-e1758712940300-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal for a lawsuit brought by environmental, youth and activist groups challenging the constitutionality of oil and gas pollution in the state.
The lawsuit, Atencio v. State of New Mexico, filed in May 2023, argues that the state’s permitting of oil and gas production, alongside a failure to enforce pollution laws, violates its duty laid out in a 1971 amendment Article 20, Section 21 of the state Constitution, the pollution control clause.
Gail Evans, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement characterized New Mexico’s Constitution as “strong” and said she was confident the state Supreme Court would “uphold New Mexicans’ right to protection of our health and our environment.”




Pollution Control
“The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
– New Mexico constitutional amendment approved by voters November 1971




Plaintiffs requested the courts rule the state has a constitutional duty to prevent pollution — similar to landmark rulings in education and workers’ compensation — and asked the courts to “suspend additional permitting of oil and gas wells” until the state is in compliance. Moreover, plaintiffs asked the courts order state government to install a regulatory structure and plan to protect from pollution.
In June 2024,  First District Judge Matthew Wilson dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the Legislature, but allowed the case to continue moving through the courts to determine if a constitutional right to pollution control exists.
A year later, in June of this year, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed that ruling and concluded that the judiciary does not have the power to address the plaintiffs’ claims.
The plaintiffs appealed and will now have their case heard by the state Supreme Court, which did not provide any additional scheduling information on the case.
“We have hope that the Supreme Court will find that our state constitution guarantees our right to a healthy environment and upholds the requirement that the state protect us from toxic oil and gas pollution,” Johnny Juarez with Youth United for Climate Crisis Action said in a statement. “We brought this case to protect every New Mexican from the devastation caused by the state’s failure to control this filthy industry. It’s time the state lives up to that commitment.”
The suit also contends that oil and gas pollution disproportionately harms Indigenous, youth and frontline communities, and seeks additional constitutional relief for those alleged harms as well.
Attorneys for the State of New Mexico have previously argued the case oversteps separations of power between the branches of government, and that youth and frontline communities are not protected classes and there’s no discriminatory intent.
Mario Atencio (Diné), one of the plaintiffs, has previously discussed damage to sacred Navajo lands as a result of the oil and gas industry. “Our Constitution requires protection of our healthful environment, and yet the state continues to allow the industry to make our air unhealthy to breathe, and to waste and contaminate our precious drinking water, all for fracking,” Atencio said in a statement Monday. “With our Constitution, we hope to ensure that the state protects all of us from the harms of this dangerous industry.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC1659_01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

California state officials are in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference. The visit highlights California’s role as a climate leader and supports its environmental policies, especially since the U.S. has no official federal delegation. However, some critics question whether the trip is worthwhile because California lacks the power to make international agreements.


California likes to think of itself as a nation — and this week, it’s acting like one. Gov. Gavin Newsom, top state officials and legislators are leading a delegation to the United Nations’ 30th Conference of Parties this week in Belém, a gateway to Brazil’s Amazon region. 
The state has no seat in the rooms where nations will negotiate their commitments under international law to curbing greenhouse gases. But California and the governor are there anyway, to project his and the state’s climate message onto the global stage. 
“The reason I’m here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States — this vacuum, it’s rather jaw dropping,” Newsom said Monday in São Paulo, speaking at the Milken Institute Global Investors’ Symposium. “Not even an observer; not someone taking notes.”
After the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time earlier this year, California was left symbolically standing in for a United States government.
Supporters say the annual global climate conference is worth it, pointing to policies inspired by and partnerships formed at past conferences. But environmental justice advocates question the value of these excursions, arguing the events are too distant and industry-driven to reflect frontline communities.
California’s presence on the world stage may matter more than ever, experts said — but the state can’t substitute for the world’s leading superpower. Although it’s Newsom’s first time at the summit, he has sent state representatives to every event since he took office. 
“If we weren’t doing things like this, then the rest of the world would be even more puzzled as to what’s going on inside the United States,” said UC San Diego climate expert David G. Victor. “The symbolic value of showing that the United States has not completely abandoned climate and clean energy…is pretty important for the rest of the world, but there’s not a huge caloric value to it.”
International events influence state policy 
California officials who attend the climate conference say they foster relationships with international leaders that influence policy, both through subnational agreements and through legislative efforts. 
“Californians have been very clear that we also need to take actions … to combat climate change,” said state Natural Resources Agency Secretary Wade Crowfoot, part of the delegation to Brazil. “And simply put, it doesn’t make any sense that all of the answers would be found in California.” 
As a strategy to achieve its goals, California has signed dozens of agreements with other regional governments and some nations, including Mexico, Australia and Denmark. 
In August, Newsom signed an agreement with Denmark committing to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 — a goal established in an executive order and in state law — and to collaborate on ways to improve cyber resilience. In March, the state entered an agreement with the Mexican state of Sonora to expand renewable electricity generation and cross-border energy trade.
The state’s relationship with Denmark has helped California gain access to technology to better manage its water systems, Crowfoot added. Using that geophysical imaging technology, Stanford researchers were able to map the state’s groundwater system as part of a joint study. 
Legislators say the climate conference itself has brought solutions from abroad to local problems. 
Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat who represents Merced,  said severe climate impacts to her region prompted her to look for answers internationally. In 2023, she traveled to the U.N. summit in Dubai – in part, she said, looking for climate solutions that would keep workers in her region employed as the state transitions away from fossil fuels.
“I’ve been concerned with the lack of investments that actually make a difference in rural and poorly resourced communities,” Caballero said. “So I was looking for alternatives.”
The Dubai trip inspired a number of bills, she said, including one that directs the state Air Resources Board to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. Newsom signed the bill into law in 2022.  Caballero said she has met with people from the Amazon who are affected by climate change, and “it was very moving,” she said. 
“The impact we have on the world is tremendous, and we just need to be more sensitive to that.”
What’s in it for state leaders? 
With the fourth-largest economy in the world, California wields clout even without being directly involved in global climate talks. Newsom is continuing a decades-long tradition of state governors who have used the U.N. summit as a chance to cement their status as climate leaders and substitute diplomats.
Arnold Schwarzenegger was the first California governor to attend the conference, flying to Copenhagen in 2009.  Then, Jerry Brown attended the 2015 summit where the United Nations signed the Paris agreement, a legally-binding treaty aimed at limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. That year, Brown started the Under 2 Coalition, a group of 200 subnational governments that share knowledge with each other to work toward that goal. 
It’s Newsom’s first time attending the international conference, but he has burnished his profile as a climate leader by travelling to other events. 
In the past, Newsom has appeared regularly at Climate Week in New York City, where he told a United Nations summit in 2023 that “this climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis.” This year, however, he has moderated his posture toward the fossil fuel industry, advancing legislation to expand drilling in Kern County and slowing certain regulations. In 2023, he also traveled to China to promote California’s zero-emission vehicle agenda.
He was named co-chair of the U.N. summit’s newly-formed Local Leaders Forum, a group of regional and state leaders that met in Rio de Janeiro the week before the conference to discuss subnational strategies to reduce emission.
So far at events around the conference in Brazil, Newsom has highlighted the state’s progress in deploying electric cars, extending its cap and trade program through 2045 and increasingly running the grid on renewable energy such as wind, solar, and battery storage.
“The state of California has been a consistent partner for a half century, and will continue to be for decades to come,” he said.
For Newsom, attending the conference is also about positioning himself as a global leader as he considers a 2028 presidential run.  
Shannon Gibson, a University of Southern California professor who teaches global climate policy, said the U.N. summit offers a massive international stage, media coverage and access to world leaders that help Newsom advance his climate agenda.
It’s not a bad place for Newsom to showcase his presidential leadership abilities, she added. 
“It’s the ability to network and rub elbows with high level leaders, prime ministers and presidents from all around the world,” Gibson said. “It does present an international stage where Gov. Newsom could take his domestic policies and advance them at that global level.”
Not everyone sees the governor’s global spotlight as a virtue. State Senator Tony Strickland, a Republican from Huntington Beach, said Newsom should be tackling the state’s affordability crisis instead of viewing every decision through the lens of a future presidential run.
“We have major problems here in California,” Strickland said. “We need a leader to solve these problems.”
Costs & Controversy 
A private nonprofit tied to the governor paid for Newsom’s trip to Brazil. The non-profit helps fund a range of official travel and ceremonial events, drawing money both from his inaugural committees and outside donors.
The California State Protocol Foundation is a charitable nonprofit corporation whose purpose is “to lessen the burden on California taxpayers by relieving the state of California of its obligations to fund certain expenditures.” The Governor’s own inaugural committees have contributed at least $5 million since 2019, according to data from the Fair Political Practices Commission reviewed by CalMatters.  The governor established inaugural committees to pay for events and official activities surrounding his 2019 and 2023 inaugurations.
The protocol foundation has drawn a range of outside donors to pay for state officials’ international travel – not just to climate conferences. The Hewlett Foundation provided $300,000 in 2023 to support the Governor’s climate-focused trip to China. The Los Angeles Dodgers contributed $25,000 in 2021 to help underwrite his State of the State address at Dodger Stadium. 
“We don’t live in an ideal world,” said Jessica A. Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. “On the one hand, you’re trying to protect our scarcest resource, which is taxpayer dollars,” she continued, “on the other hand, you are, of course, allowing private influence over public officials.”
Legislators said they cover their expenses to attend international climate conferences with campaign funds and their own money. And in 2021, two nonprofits, the Climate Action Reserve and the Climate Registry covered some costs for lawmakers to attend the event in Scotland. 
That year, the Assembly covered the costs for a few security staff to accompany them –  funded by taxpayer dollars. This year, there is no extra security or staff accompanying the two legislators attending: Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, and Senator Henry Stern, a Democrat from the Calabasas area.  
Recently, environmental justice and indigenous communities have criticized the U.N.’s choices to hold events in regions that have an economic interest in fossil fuels: Dubai in 2023 and Azerbaijan in 2024. 
This year’s conference is also controversial for some, because it’s located in populous but remote Belém, which some say lacks sufficient infrastructure. Attendees took multiple planes to reach the city, and hotel options are limited. 
Caballero said she opted out of attending the conference this year, as she did last year, because of the length of the journey.
“I would go in a heartbeat,” she said, “if it weren’t for the inconvenient travel.”
Environmental groups are skeptical 
Schwarzenegger was seen as a trailblazer when he first attended the U.N. conference. But more than a decade later, he offered a different perspective: bringing world leaders together to commit to the same goals year after year is a waste of time. 
“The definition of insanity is you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results,” he said. “When it comes to the negotiations with the U.N., these COP kind of agreements, I think it’s set up the wrong way.” 
Critics question the practical value of California’s presence around international climate talks. The state’s subnational agreements are largely aspirational. Environmental activists, who lack access to international talks and funds to attend conferences, raise concerns about how well state agencies represent local interests abroad. 
“In a lot of ways, it seems like it’s a pretty performative meeting,” said Catherine Garoupa, executive director of the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and a member of the Air Resources Board’s environmental justice advisory committee.  “I’ve never had a conversation or been consulted by anyone who participates in that forum.”
Jaron Browne, an Oakland organizer with the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, traveled to Belém for the People’s Climate Summit,  a parallel gathering where activists and Indigenous leaders called for fairer climate policies, stronger land protections, and accountability for major polluters.
Browne said that while California speaks with urgency on climate, its continued reliance on imported crude oil undercuts that message. 
What communities near the fencelines of refineries and other industrial polluters want is to stop pollution at its source, said Browne. The bigger problem, he added, is that carbon markets like California’s cap-and-trade system let companies keep polluting while claiming progress by buying offsets or funding forest projects.
“Thank God we have a voice that is speaking about the urgency of the crisis, and that’s very important, and taking some really important progressive stances,” Browne said. At the same time, “we talk out of both sides of our mouths.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725-COP30-Brazil-WM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

(Photo courtesy of Dwight ""Andy"" Anderson)During World War II, countless men and women from Utah answered the call, leaving behind their families, their futures, and their dreams to defend the freedoms we cherish today. Thousands of miles away from home, they faced unimaginable challenges and endured horrific conditions. They did not seek recognition or reward, yet history will forever remember them as heroes. Among the brave souls who left Utah but never returned was Pvt. Samuel “Sam” C. Morrelli. 
I was born in Paris, and about 10 years ago, I carried out extensive research on American heroes buried at the Epinal American Cemetery in France. That’s when I first learned about Pvt. Morrelli. Using a detailed obituary published by the Standard-Examiner in Ogden, Utah, in December 1944 and a biography of his father, I compiled his story to share.
Sam was born on March 14, 1923, in Ogden, Utah, to Amico Giusto “Mike” Morrelli and Pauline Lena “Polly” Lombardi. He grew up in a home filled with love and laughter, sharing unforgettable moments with his siblings. Even from a young age, Sam stood out for his kindness and determination. At just 12 years old, he worked with his father, helping build their family’s brick home from the ground up. Mornings, nights, and weekends were spent hammering, mixing, and laying bricks. He was rewarded with a new bicycle — a gift that made him so happy. 
Sam attended St. Joseph Catholic School and graduated from Ogden High School in 1939. Known for his sharp mind, work ethic and generosity, he was admired by his teachers and loved by his classmates. At Weber College, he continued to grow into a young man of character, integrity and promise. 
When the world fell into chaos and freedom stood in peril, Sam felt a call that couldn’t be ignored. Driven by a deep sense of duty and love for his country, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve Corps on Nov. 27, 1942. Initially part of the Air Corps Engineer Reserve, he studied for nine months at the University of South Dakota before transitioning to the infantry. He was later assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 324th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Division. In September 1944, Sam was deployed to Europe — stepping into the heart of one of history’s most brutal wars.
He found himself in the Vosges Mountains of France — a place of unimaginable hardship with freezing temperatures, unforgiving terrain, and relentless enemy fire. Yet Sam and his brothers-in-arms pressed forward, village by village — fighting not for glory, but to liberate people they had never met. Their courage and determination were nothing short of heroic.
In mid-November, his unit continued advancing through the Vosges, battling fiercely to break through German lines. Tragically, near the village of Avricourt, Sam was struck by enemy fire. His comrades rushed to his aid and quickly realized the severity of his injuries. Medics and nurses fought desperately to save him, but on Nov. 18, 1944, Sam died from his wounds. He was just 21 years old — with so much life ahead, and so much to give.
Back in Utah, the news of his death sent shockwaves through the entire community. Sam was a son, a brother, a friend — and now a fallen hero. For his parents, Mike and Polly, the pain was unbearable, and the silence too loud to ignore. They carried a quiet, unspoken grief for the rest of their lives. Mike passed away on Jan. 6, 1979, and Polly on Nov. 30, 1985 — both holding their beloved son close in their hearts.
Today, Sam rests in the Epinal American Cemetery in Dinozé, France — alongside 5,255 fellow Americans who laid down their lives in the battle for freedom. Endless rows of white marble crosses and Stars of David stretch out in silence — a heartbreaking reminder of what it took to defeat the forces of tyranny. Each one marks not just a grave, but a name, a voice, a story — a life full of promise, cut short by an unforgiving war.
It is our solemn responsibility to carry Sam’s memory forward and ensure his name never fades into the archives of history. Let us speak his name with reverence and pride. Let us remember the boy who built a house with his father, who loved his family, and who sacrificed everything for a cause greater than himself. Let us ensure that Pvt. Sam Morrelli is never forgotten — and that the freedom he gave his life for is never taken for granted.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/56374389_136109495106-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

The Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex in Elmore County, a 4,000-bed men’s prison, will open next October instead of May, said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, which oversees the Alabama Department of Corrections’ (ADOC) budget. 
“It’s not as far as cost is concerned. In fact because [Caddell Construction Co.] missed the date, part of the agreement is they will pay us,” Albritton said.

The news was first reported by Alabama Daily News.
The cost of the Elmore County facility has far exceeded the original budget. Lawmakers in 2021 originally appropriated $1.3 billion for the construction of the Elmore County facility and another 4,000-bed prison facility in Escambia County. 
Supporters of the plan argued that the new facilities would be safer for the incarcerated and easier to staff, as well as provide additional space for training and rehabilitation facilities. Opponents said the new facilities would be expensive and not address the causes of the violence and overcrowding crisis in the state prisons. 
The costs for the Elmore County prison have soared, due to inflations and higher than expected costs on components of the facility. 
Albritton said the Ivey Correctional Facility is now estimated to cost $1.23 billion.
“We had anticipated both facilities being a total cost of $750 million. Well, we’re way out of that league. But we were able to go to the bond market, and we obtained, I think, $500 million from the bond market, that’s all the money that’s been borrowed,” Albritton said. “And then we used other funds available to the state that we put in over the number of years that we’ve been doing this so that we have funded now all of the Elmore facility, and should have monies left over to begin the Escambia facility.”
Messages seeking comment were left with Ivey and the Alabama Department of Corrections on Monday.
The Elmore County facility is set to have more cells instead of dorms, specialized medical and mental health facilities and centralized spaces to better monitor inmates.
State officials are also prepared to borrow an undisclosed amount of money to start construction on the Escambia County facility. 
“We anticipate and we’ve gotten different estimates on there. But as far as bonding authority we have, we have a bonding authority available more than is needed for the construction of the Escambia facility,” Albritton said.
Albritton sponsored a bill earlier this year to extend the borrowing authority of the Alabama Corrections Institutions Finance Authority.
The 4,000-bed facility in Escambia County has not begun construction and is still in the planning phase.
“We have a large population of inmates that’s growing. The facilities that we haven’t built a prison in 50 years or more. generations. And none of them have been maintained very well. We’ve closed two or three in the last five years, so we have fewer beds and we have more people,” Albritton said.
As of August, there were 21,121 inmates in Alabama prisons. There are 14 major correctional facilities in Alabama.
Inmates will also be moved to the two new facilities to help reduce overcrowding.
“It won’t be an overnight thing. It’s going to take us a while to get people moved in, and also we got to have the staffing that’s available in each too, so it’s going to take a while, but we are foreseeing that and planning for that,” Albritton said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-cell-Holman-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

Katie Britt, R-Alabama, expressed skepticism Monday of a proposal to renew Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies one year.
Speaking to the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce via teleconference from Washington, Britt suggested that the proposal would not be sufficient.
“A proposal of just a one-year extension doesn’t deal with any of the issues that are in front of us on that,” Britt said of the Affordable Care Act. “There is no income cap for anyone who receives those subsidies.”
About 478,000 Alabamians, or 9.3% of the population, currently get health insurance through Affordable Care Act plans. The enhanced ACA subsidies, first approved by Congress in 2021 and extended the following year, lower insurance costs and make those making more than 400% of the federal poverty level eligible for tax credits through the marketplace. The subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. That could lead to premiums more than doubling.
“The loss of the enhanced tax credits is going to result in 2026 health care premiums skyrocketing,” said Natasha Murphy, director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, in an interview on Monday.
Murphy said there had been fraud from some brokers and agents applying for assistance on people’s behalf, but that there had been safeguards put in place.
“The notion that individuals are, in every enrollment, enrolling in health coverage trying to get tax credits is definitely not the case,” she said. “People are not getting hard checks for their health coverage. These are funds that are going to the insurance company on behalf of their monthly premiums.”
Britt spoke a day after seven Democrats and one independent joined nearly all Republican senators in voting to advance a bill to end the federal government shutdown, the longest in history. The bill would restore aid for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) and return federal workers fired during the shutdown. It would not extend the ACA credits, the major sticking point for Democrats during the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said he will hold a vote on them in the Republican-dominated chamber.
“What we said is that we would take the budget as it currently exists, which ironically is President (Joe) Biden’s budget, and we would extend that for the next several weeks as we work to do our jobs,” Britt said during the event. “The reason we ended up having to do a continuing resolution is because we have not passed appropriation bills.”
The move will allow to approve four bills: the continuing resolution and three appropriations measures to fund the Legislative Branch, the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration through fiscal year 2026.
The continuing resolution would keep the government open through Jan. 30.
Appropriations for USDA was one of the most heavily publicized because it is the agency responsible for overseeing SNAP, which helps low-income households pay for food. It covers about 726,000 Alabamians. . The compromise funds the program for the remainder of the year.
Food banks saw increased need as more people sought their assistance as the benefits expired.
Two federal judges and an appeals court ordered the administration to use emergency funding to allow the program to continue, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the payment of benefits Friday.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Katie-Britt-April-17-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)
The state environment department on Monday announced free filters and water testing for residents in La Cienega and La Cieneguilla, two Santa Fe County communities where toxic chemicals have been identified in the groundwater.
Specifically, a report by research firm INTERA found that one in three parcels in both areas showed PFAS contamination in the underlying groundwater, with 169 parcels showing contamination above Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards, a New Mexico Environment Department news release said. Total PFAS levels were found to be as high as 800 parts per trillion, which is more than 200 times the federal drinking water standard of 4 parts per trillion set for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two of the many PFAS compounds. The source of the contamination and solutions for cleaning the groundwater remain under investigation, the department said.
PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances), so-called “forever chemicals” are a class of synthetic chemicals used in the manufacture of everything from rugs to cookware to firefighting foams. Exposure through contaminated water and soil, as well as through the plants and animals, cause PFAS to build up in the human body. While still being studied, PFAS exposure is linked to increased cancer risks, fertility issues, low birth weights or fetal development issues, hormonal imbalances and limiting vaccine effectiveness.
Environment Secretary James Kenney said the state had funded the study and contracted with TLC Plumbing to install the filters in residents’ homes. “If your private well water exceeds PFAS drinking water standards, installing a filter in your home is the best way for residents to protect themselves from these chemicals, which can lead to health issues,” Kenney said in a statement.
La Cienega and La Cieneguilla are the latest communities working with the state to counter exposure to PFAS. NMED last month announced that approximately 100 homes in Curry County would be receiving a new water source to lessen their exposure to toxic PFAS in their drinking wells from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.
The state has also kicked off the rulemaking process for a new law that requires labeling for some intentionally added PFAS to certain consumer products, and an eventual ban of them.
New Mexico’s efforts to regulate PFAS attract national industry pushback

NMED also will host an open house at the La Cienega Community Center on Nov. 15, and intends to attend the community’s own town hall on PFAS this week.
“Environmental justice has long been a concern for La Cieneguilla and surrounding area residents and now our highest priority is to assure that households and agriculture can return to having clean and healthy water,” Santa Fe County Commissioner Camilla Bustamante said in a statement. “I am grateful that Secretary Kenney has assured support in holding the sources of this contamination accountable. Be assured that together we will identify the most effective long-term strategies to return and protect the quality of our waters.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Villegas15_PFAS_1.25.2024-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

This Veterans Day, however, the Trump administration is threatening to undo our progress against homelessness in ways that could hurt veterans in particular.
The U.S. has made incredible strides in reducing veteran homelessness by 55% since 2009. In contrast, overall homelessness declined by only 10% through 2022 and then surged to a record high in 2024 as pandemic relief measures came to an end.
At the center of our remarkable progress for veterans are two strategies: housing vouchers and the “Housing First” approach (which starts with the premise that people need safe, stable housing before they can successfully address other life challenges, like unemployment or substance use disorder).
Now, the Trump administration wants to slash both and, worse yet, replace them with increased criminalization measures. This will hurt veterans and hundreds of thousands of other Americans experiencing homelessness or on the brink.
In July, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) seeking to weaken protections against forced institutionalization of people with mental health disabilities and unhoused people. The EO also directs federal grant programs that fund community homeless services to abandon evidence-based, humane approaches — like Housing First — and instead reward communities that center arrest and incarceration.

If implemented, these policy changes could disproportionately harm veterans, of whom about one-third have a disability here in Michigan. Among unhoused veterans, the disability rate is 55% – notably higher than for unhoused people overall. Specifically, 1 in 3 has a mental health disability, 1 in 3 has a physical disability, and 1 in 6 has a chronic health condition.
At the same time, the Trump administration is pushing for a 50% cut to federal rental assistance programs, including Housing Choice Vouchers, and a 70% cut to the agency that enforces fair housing laws. Reported cases of housing discrimination are rising, with disability-based discrimination now making up more than half. Thus, gutting this agency could threaten access to safe housing for veterans in particular.
The monstrous Trump crackdown on disabled and unhoused folks comes alongside massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance under the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In Michigan, 39,000 veterans are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and more than 57,000 are enrolled in Medicaid. The Republican-sponsored bill eliminated a provision that made it easier for veterans and unhoused people to access their SNAP benefits and puts half a million Michiganders at risk of losing their health insurance.
During Trump’s first term, homelessness ticked up after years of slow but steady decline. Now, the Trump administration’s agenda threatens to push more Americans — including veterans and their families — into economic precarity. This essentially guarantees continued growth of the unhoused population who would be targeted for lockup, either in psychiatric institutions or jails.
Obviously, saddling people with criminal records and fines they can’t pay won’t make it easier for them to secure gainful employment and stable housing in the future. A person who has been incarcerated once is nearly seven times more likely to experience homelessness, and, for those incarcerated more than once, 13 times more likely.
The Trump administration’s war on homeless people will have a particular impact on disabled people and veterans. That the president and those propping him up would take freedom away from those who have defended ours — many of whom became disabled in service to our country — is unconscionable. To honor U.S. veterans this year, we can start by making sure they and the fellow Americans they have dedicated their lives to serving all have safe, stable homes.

Now, it's capable of producing as many as 320,000 quail eggs a year.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
Jared McCool’s path to becoming a farmer began — nearly a decade ago — with a dog.
The Marine veteran and self-described “city boy” from Waterbury had agreed to go pheasant hunting with friends in the Naugatuck State Forest. It was McCool’s second attempt after an unsuccessful earlier outing, and he was reluctant to try again.
But this time his friends brought along Boone, a German short-haired pointer, and McCool said he was inspired by the way the dog and its handler worked together to pursue, shoot and retrieve their quarry.
“When I was in the Marine Corps, I felt like I had a purpose,” said McCool, who served from 2008 to 2014 and was deployed in Jordan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. “What I did made a difference to myself, the people I directly worked with, and part of an overall, bigger mission in some way, shape or form. I felt accomplished.”
That same feeling of purpose came back to him on that hunting trip, McCool said. “I wanted to immerse myself in everything that had to do with that dog, which were the game birds that drove her.”

The experience led McCool to open Steadfast Farms in 2017. The farm, which he operates with his brother, Aaron, has since grown to become one of the state’s largest producers of game birds such as quail, pheasant and chukar — a type of partridge. The brothers also raise thousands of chickens and hundreds of turkeys each year.
In addition, McCool has enlisted the support of other veterans as president of the Connecticut chapter of the Veteran Farmer Coalition, a national organization. The group’s work includes connecting returning vets to careers in agriculture and promoting the work of the state’s existing veteran-owned farms through farm stands, marketing and help applying for grants.
In 2023, the coalition launched a website, CTVeteranGrown.org, that serves as a hub for farmers as well as a resource for customers to find produce, meat, honey and other products from local veteran-owned farms. More than 40 farms are currently listed on the site.
The project is supported by the nonprofit Connecticut Resource Conservation and Development (CT RC&D) through a multi-year $500,000 grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration. In addition, participating farms get permission to market their products with a specialized “Homegrown by Heroes” label that also features branding from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture.
“People usually like to support local. This is just an added benefit that we’re supporting our military veterans,” said Amanda Fargo-Johnson, the agricultural programs director at CT RC&D. The tagline for the program is, “Served then, still serving now.”
In 2022 there were 668 farms in Connecticut operated by veterans or people serving in the military, according the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The total value of products produced by those farms was more than $62 million.

Fad foods
McCool’s first step in launching Steadfast Farms was to purchase several acres of land in Bethlehem that included a ranch house and a small barn where he could protect his birds from predators such as bears and coyotes. At the time, he was working in sales for a technology company — a job that he says paid well but left him searching for more fulfillment.
Early on, McCool and a business partner at the time decided to focus on raising quail for their eggs, which were gaining popularity as a “superfood” rich in protein and vitamin B12. 
Working nights, early mornings and weekends on the farm, McCool said he was able to bring roughly 1,500 game birds to market in the first year.
“That was a lot, because I was a city boy,” he said. Still, at that point, it wasn’t enough to turn a profit. But the farm was gaining momentum. 
McCool expanded into raising chickens and turkeys. Then, after losing his day job during the COVID-19 pandemic, he jumped full time into farming. 
In 2020, he brought his brother Aaron on board as the farm’s director of operations. That same year, Steadfast Farms received a matching grant from the state allowing the brothers to begin construction of a processing facility for egg production, slaughter and meatpacking.
Today, Steadfast Farms raises up to 16,000 birds a year while processing another 21,000 birds raised on farms from as far away as Maine. And they’re making money.
In addition to being the only federally inspected poultry slaughter facility in Connecticut, Steadfast Farms has also received its organic handling certification from the USDA.
The brothers are currently planning the next expansion of their processing facility, which will allow them to scale up production of pre-packaged products such as chicken sausages, pickled quail eggs and Thanksgiving turkeys. By the end of this year, they hope to be able to ship products nationwide.
“I make less money [than working in sales], I work longer hours, I wake up earlier, go to bed later — and I couldn’t be happier,” McCool said. “It is so easy to get up in the morning because you’re just ready to start the next day.”

McCool attributed much of the farm’s success to the sustained popularity of quail eggs. The farm’s flock is capable of producing as many as 320,000 eggs a year. 
“BJs is carrying quail eggs, most of your supermarkets are carrying quail eggs, now you’re starting to see Instagram influencers post about quail eggs,” he said. “Really, the only thing keeping [quail] out of the mainstream right now is not the taste, it’s not the amount of meat, it’s the cost.”
Coturnix quail, the type the McCools raise, lay eggs that are about one-third the size of chicken egg. Steadfast Farms sells a dozen quail eggs for $7.25. McCool is also working on breeding his own plump variety of quail that lays fewer eggs but comes with about 50% more meat.
In addition to raising birds for their meats and eggs, Steadfast Farms also sells live game birds to other farms, private hunting clubs and state agencies such as the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife to stock during hunting season.
Following the brothers around the farm these days is Remi, another German shorthaired pointer that McCool purchased from the same breeder as the dog that inspired his interest in farming nearly a decade ago. His brother is quick to note the significance as he offers Remi a scratch behind the ears.
“Everything we do here is because of her,” Aaron said.

A helping hand
The idea to establish a statewide network of veteran farmers came to McCool in 2019, when he was in the process of applying for a federal grant to install solar panels on the roof of his farmhouse.
At the time, he said, he was struggling to navigate the myriad programs available from Connecticut Department of Agriculture to support small farmers.
“Connecticut has tons of resources for new and beginning farmers, but it is analysis paralysis, click a link to another link,” McCool said. “You didn’t really know who to talk to, how to follow through to take advantage of these programs.” 
McCool found a helping hand through Fargo-Johnson and CT RC&D’s Farm Up program, which offers one-on-one counseling and support services to small farmers and agricultural businesses. “Amanda was so good at what she did with the solar I was like, ‘Amanda, it would be great if, like, I had a you to help me navigate all the Department of Agriculture programs,” he recalled.

As a result of those conversations, RC&D expanded its Farm Up program to include assistance that was specifically tailored to veteran farmers. Fargo-Johnson said that one of the biggest hurdles facing veterans seeking a start in the industry is that, for the most part, they are not inheriting farmland from their parents or grandparents. 
‘They’re first-generation farmers trying to figure out, you know, where can I farm?” Fargo-Johnson said. “They don’t walk into a farm family who says, ‘Great, take over the business.’ So that’s really a challenge, kind of setting their anchor and finding where they can grow their business, their family, everything.”
While McCool said that Farm Up offered vital logistical support for veteran farmers, he still felt there was a need for an organization that could provide the sense of “camaraderie” that he had felt during his military service.
After doing more research online, McCool said he came cross the Veteran Farmer Coalition, which was opening up chapters in more than a dozen states across the country. Again working with Fargo-Johnson and other local veterans, he helped launch the first Connecticut chapter in 2022. 
In addition to monthly meetings, McCool said the group hosts quarterly gatherings and messaging groups across various platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp where members can find social interaction or a helpful bit of advice.
“What we find is, yes, veterans want camaraderie, but especially the ones that farm or run businesses, we’re all always busy,” McCool said.
As a result of the resources that have been made available through RC&D and the Farmer Veteran Coalition, the number of veterans who received farm transition grants from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture went from four in 2024 to eight so far this year.
“We’re actually seeing the growth of this community happen,” Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt said. “There’s a lot more attention… from media, but also from other farmer veterans who realize that it’s not just a social group of people with a shared experience, but it’s a business relationship group as well that can help support them in their business development.”

Clearing a ‘path’
In their latest initiative, McCool and the Farmer Veteran Coalition are working again with RC&D to launch program called “Path to Victory” that pairs returning veterans with more experienced farmers for a longer mentorship period. The program is being funded through a $50,000 grant from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture that was awarded in 2024.
Steven Thompson, the owner of Thy Neighbors Farm in Torrington, is helping to lead that effort. Thompson, who served as a scout sniper in the U.S. Marine Corps, began farming in 2020 and currently grows vegetables along with a sheep flock that he grazes on nearby solar fields.
Other mentorship opportunities are also available for veterans interested in beekeeping, maple syrup production, growing cut flowers and other types of agriculture, he said.
“If any veteran in the state of Connecticut is interested in farming, right now is the time,” Thompson said. “Even if they’re going to start something small on the side, not do it full time, if they want to get something started or think maybe in the future they do, it would be very foolish not to capitalize on the opportunities available right now.”
Since opening Steadfast Farms, McCool said he has employed four veterans, none of whom are still working there. That experience, he said, has opened his eyes to the different paths that working on a farm could lead to for other returning veterans.
“I found farming as being such a successful and consistent process of healing and having a purpose, and that transition from the military back to civilian life, it checked all the boxes for me,” McCool said.
“The veterans that have come through here, I always expected them to stay here like it would check all the boxes for them, but I learned that that wasn’t the case,” he continued. “I might just be a stop on their recovery or their understanding of what the next chapter is in their life after service.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1017_SR_SteadfastFarms_349-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

Read this story in English.
La Asamblea General de Connecticut se reunirá en sesión extraordinaria el miércoles, adoptando una vez más una perspectiva amplia sobre lo que constituye una emergencia que requiere acción antes de la próxima sesión ordinaria anual, que comienza el 4 de febrero.
Por su frecuencia, las sesiones extraordinarias tienen poco de extraordinarias. Los legisladores han regresado a Hartford para sesiones extraordinarias al menos una vez en 41 de los 54 años transcurridos desde 1971, cuando la Asamblea General comenzó a reunirse anualmente.
La Constitución de Connecticut establece que la legislatura, un organismo a tiempo parcial cuyos miembros suelen tener otros trabajos, se reúne en sesión ordinaria durante cinco meses en los años impares y tres meses en los años pares. No impone límites a las sesiones extraordinarias.
¿Quién decide convocar una sesión extraordinaria?
La legislatura puede autoconvocarse, pero normalmente la inicia el gobernador. Este emite una “convocatoria”, una proclamación que describe los temas que se abordarán.
¿Cómo se convoca a los legisladores?
Antes era un proceso engorroso, que requería un aviso entregado a los legisladores por correo certificado con hasta 15 días de antelación, o notificado en persona por un alguacil estatal, un agente de policía u otra “persona imparcial” al menos 24 horas antes de la sesión. El Gobernador William A. O’Neill incluso hizo que la policía estatal les entregara una citación para que regresaran la última noche de una sesión cuando se fueron sin haber aprobado un presupuesto.
¿Así que había policías recorriendo el estado durante el fin de semana para obligarlos a regresar?
No, ahora se hace por correo electrónico. La legislatura aprobó una ley en 2016 que permite la transmisión electrónica de la convocatoria. Debe enviarse al menos 72 horas antes de la sesión.
Entonces, ¿los legisladores solo pueden actuar sobre los temas descritos por el gobernador en la convocatoria?
No exactamente. La legislatura siempre tiene la opción de convocar su propia sesión extraordinaria para abordar otros temas. Los legisladores pueden estar literalmente en más de una sesión extraordinaria al mismo tiempo.
Suena confuso. ¿Cómo funciona eso?
La mejor manera de visualizar sesiones extraordinarias simultáneas es imaginar una computadora con varias pantallas abiertas. Al igual que usted alterna entre las pantallas de su computadora, la legislatura puede hacerlo con diferentes sesiones extraordinarias.
¿Cuánto duran las sesiones extraordinarias?
La mayoría son breves, de uno o dos días. Hay excepciones notables.
¿Cuándo ocurrió?
La sesión extraordinaria por excelencia fue en 1991, el año en que se adoptó el impuesto sobre la renta, se derogó y entró en vigor después de que se vetara el proyecto de ley de derogación, todo ello en una sesión extraordinaria que se extendió hasta el 19 de septiembre.
¿Y luego se fueron a casa?
Por poco tiempo. Una vez que fracasó la derogación, pasaron a lo que llamaron “reparación”. Estuvieron trabajando hasta el Día de Acción de Gracias, y finalmente dieron por terminada la sesión el 18 de diciembre.
Durante una sesión ordinaria, la legislatura tarda meses en redactar los proyectos de ley y someterlos a la revisión de un comité y a una audiencia pública. ¿Cómo hacen todo eso en una sesión extraordinaria que dura uno o dos días?
No lo hacen. Como vimos el viernes, cuando el gobernador y los legisladores presentaron un proyecto de ley de vivienda que se debatirá el miércoles en la Cámara de Representantes, la legislación generalmente se redacta antes de que regresen los legisladores.
¿Alguna vez hacen eso en una sesión extraordinaria?
A veces. Si el presidente de la Cámara de Representantes y el presidente pro tempore del Senado están de acuerdo, cualquier proyecto de ley puede ser declarado “de emergencia” y presentarse para una votación en el pleno sin una audiencia ni revisión de comité.
¿Tienen prohibido celebrar una audiencia pública en una sesión extraordinaria?
No, la legislatura establece las reglas.
Además del impuesto sobre la renta, ¿cuáles son algunas de las cosas más notables que se han hecho en sesiones extraordinarias?
El innovador sistema de financiación pública de campañas de Connecticut se implementó en una sesión extraordinaria convocada por la Gobernadora M. Jodi Rell en 2005. El proyecto de ley se aprobó en septiembre después de un verano de negociaciones.
El cannabis recreativo se legalizó en una sesión extraordinaria mediante un proyecto de ley que obtuvo la aprobación final en el Senado el 17 de junio de 2021. La sesión ordinaria había terminado el 9 de junio con la aprobación del Senado, pero sin la acción de la Cámara de Representantes.
El Senado volvió a aprobar el proyecto de ley en la sesión extraordinaria, solo para verlo modificado en la Cámara de Representantes. El Senado aprobó la versión final.
¿Los legisladores reciben un pago adicional por las sesiones extraordinarias?
No.

Tina Kotek on Friday signed Oregon’s long-awaited transportation bill into law, setting the stage for opponents to begin collecting signatures for a referendum effort to overturn it.
After Democrats in the Oregon Legislature secured enough votes to pass the transportation bill in a special session that ended in late September, Kotek had 30 working days, or until Nov. 12, to sign it into law. By using almost all 30 days to sign it, Republican opponents have less time to gather the signatures to qualify for a referendum on the November 2026 ballot. If they are successful at gathering enough signatures, a referendum would give Oregon voters the opportunity to reject or approve the new law.
State Rep. Ed Diehl, R-Stayton, Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Dundee and Taxpayer Association of Oregon Director Jason Williams — the chief petitioners behind the “No Tax Oregon” referendum effort — submitted paperwork to the Oregon Secretary of State Monday morning to begin collecting signatures. The secretary must review and approve the referendum forms before they can officially start.
“We feel pretty confident that by the end of this week, we will be good to go,” Diehl told the Capital Chronicle.
Petitioners have 90 calendar days from the Legislature’s adjournment to gather 78,116 signatures, which was 4% of the total ballots cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. This means they have until Dec. 30 to submit all the signatures.
The transportation law is expected to raise about $4.3 billion over the next 10 years for road maintenance and operations by:

Raising the gas tax by 6 cents.
Increasing annual registration fees from $43 to $85 for passenger vehicles; $63 to $105 for utility vehicles, light trailers, low-speed vehicles and medium-speed electric vehicles; and $44 to $86 for mopeds and motorcycles, beginning Dec. 31.
Increasing title fees for passenger vehicles from $77 to $216, beginning Dec. 31.
Doubling the payroll tax used to fund public transit from 0.1% to 0.2% of a paycheck until January 2028. For the average Oregonian making $68,000 a year, that means paying $136 a year for this tax, or $11.20 a month.

The referendum effort seeks to reject those four components of the law.
Kotek said she is grateful to the broad coalition of cities, counties, transportation workers, truckers and the American Automobile Association for supporting the legislation.
“This bill will help us keep state highways and local roads safe and open to traffic while preserving transit service and halting the pending layoffs of essential transportation staff,” Kotek said in a statement.
Starr criticized Kotek for taking a month to sign the transportation funding bill, saying she used a delay tactic that undermines public trust.
“At every turn, (Kotek) chose to protect a broken status quo that raises costs on struggling families while failing to fix the structural problems that created this crisis,” Starr said in a statement. ”But Oregonians will not be silenced, and their voices will not be ignored. They will have the opportunity to weigh in, hold their leaders accountable and demand a transportation system that works for the people who pay for it.”
The chief petitioners formed a political committee for the referendum on Oct. 2, but on Nov. 4 discontinued the committee because it was filed incorrectly and risked facing penalties, Oregon Secretary of State spokesperson Tess Seger said. Diehl said he and the chief petitioners are reforming the committee.

It is heartening that so many people love the forest, but disagreement about whether and how to manage forests is just under the surface.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rob Riley: Embracing ecological forestry, a new approach to forest management .","This commentary is by Rob Riley. He is president of the Northern Forest Center, a regional innovation and investment partner creating rural vibrancy by connecting people, economy and the forested landscape.


I’ve had the opportunity to walk in the forest with ecologists, recreationists, conservationists, foresters, casual observers, and more. The commonality among them all is that they love the forest! 
My recent time in the trees — ranging from Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom to the heart of Maine’s North Woods — illustrated the resilience of the forest and also an onslaught of threats that are devastating to contemplate. The multiple impacts of climate change — extreme weather, invasive pests and pathogens, changing seasonal patterns — are increasingly evident on the landscape and are impacting biodiversity and forest health. 
As I sit with this unpleasant reality, I’m also encouraged that we have the tools we need to address these threats, if we are open to conversation and trying new (and some old) approaches to forest management.  
Enter ecological forestry – some just say forestry, others use various aspirational modifiers — an approach that builds on the best forest science while overlaying a new emphasis on resilience and complexity to encourage the diversity of age class and type of native trees and plants. 
 An evolution in forest management 
The profession of forestry emerged in the late 1800s and grew alongside the region’s forests, many of which were recovering from heavy deforestation. The new profession established the idea of sustained yield, a principle of harvesting no more than the forests could naturally replenish, which allowed for a steady, sustainable stream of wood.  
 This idea dominated forest management for decades but gradually evolved by the late 20th century to incorporate multiple use goals beyond timber production. Landowners and foresters added habitat improvements, water quality protection, and recreational opportunities as important goals in their forest management plans. 
 As our understanding of forest ecosystems has deepened — and the pressures and demands on them have increased — foresters have recognized the need to go further. Today, foresters incorporate carbon uptake and storage, climate resilience, a greater focus on biodiversity, and other critical concerns in forest management.  
Nature knows best 
Ecological forestry prioritizes forest health and integrity. It embraces strategies that mimic the naturally occurring disturbances with which our forests have evolved and supports forests to withstand disturbances such as storms, pests and climate shifts. 
Rather than focusing primarily on timber, ecological forestry sees the entire puzzle — large living and dead trees, a mix of species, fallen logs nurturing vigorous new growth and diverse habitat.
Over the long-term, ecological forestry works to maintain all these elements across the landscape to achieve integrated environmental, economic and social outcomes. And yet it also allows for harvesting forest products — which people need for everything from building homes to paper products, and which landowners depend on for revenue to support keeping forests as forests.  
Love your forest – stand up for ecological management 
The climate crisis is real, and we need everyone to play a part. It is heartening that so many people love the forest, but disagreement about whether and how to manage forests is just under the surface. Resolving those disagreements is complicated by the fact that while much communication today defaults to soundbites and memes, forests are complex systems that deserve complex thinking and robust responses like ecological forestry. 
Now more than ever, forest management strategies must evolve to reflect the pressing realities of climate change, the need to replace carbon-intensive products with renewable forest products and the inherent complexities and dynamics of forest ecosystems. By coming together first to love the forest — and second to embrace ecological forestry — we can ask better questions, respect the forest’s complexity, and seek new solutions for supporting healthy and resilient forests.  
You can help by rejecting oversimplified arguments against managing forests and using forest products. Get out and enjoy the forest you love and choose locally produced wood products whenever you can. In the Northern Forest, we’re blessed with an abundant renewable resource, and ecological forestry is our best tool for ensuring healthy, resilient forests in the future.  
To learn more about the complexity of forests and topics such as carbon storage, the impact and response to forest pests, and ensuring forest health and resilience, readers are invited to check out the Northern Forest Center’s webinars on forest stewardship.

(Photo by Gregory Adams/Getty Images)Will nuclear waste travel all the way from Ontario, Canada to a site about an hour drive from Salt Lake City?
An interstate panel may consider a resolution later this month on whether to allow EnergySolutions to import up to 1.3 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive waste from Canada, a move worrying local advocates who argue this may be the stepping stone into accepting other types of nuclear waste.
Waste that is accepted to be buried at the Clive facility is Class A, the least hazardous radioactive waste under U.S. standards. That includes items that staff working with radioactive materials wear, like gloves, shoe coverings, cleaning materials and tools. But the proposal can still be hazardous, said Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate at the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah.
“Any level of radiation can be harmful to humans. There is no safe level, frankly,” Valdez said. “And our concern is the lack of public transparency from the company in bringing in international waste, which can lead to international security issues.”
According to EnergySolutions, the type of material being proposed for this project is identical to the low-level radioactive waste the facility has managed for over 30 years.
“While located across the nations’ northern border, these facilities in Ontario currently provide electricity to customers in the United States,” the company said in a statement.
But, environmental groups are still hesitant about the proposal since public input hasn’t been extensive. Especially with this being an unprecedented situation for the compact.
Public comment is allowed in the special meetings where the NorthWest Interstate Compact — a group of states that cooperates on low-level radioactive waste management — is considering EnergySolutions’ petition. But, not many people from the community are keeping tabs on the body, Valdez said. It was only after learning about the discussion from a mailer sent to a former executive that Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah advocates began watching the process.
“There was no announcement, there was nothing on the Division of Waste Management and Radiation Control Board’s meetings, things like that,” Valdez said. “So it was kind of per chance that we saw this and started watching it, and have been attending that.”
A big item on the advocates’ list of concerns, Valdez said, is public safety along the transportation routes for the waste, which is set to travel via rail.
Dave Noriega, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, said that “no significant, additional safety measures are necessary with this proposed project since EnergySolutions has extensive experience disposing of Class A waste.”
The state, he said, has robust regulations that minimize risks to the public and the Department of Environmental Quality will continue to regulate all low-level radioactive waste.
 Low-level radioactivity standards

Some aspects of the draft resolution are still uncertain, Valdez said. For one, will EnergySolutions classify waste coming from Canada according to U.S. or Canadian standards?
“We’re concerned about what that type of waste is because we’re just hearing that it’s related to the nuclear fuel industry,” Valdez said. “It’s mixed waste. But there’s no clarification on that.”
Noriega said the arriving waste needs to be documented as Class A before it can be shipped to Utah.
Casey Hill, a lobbyist representing EnergySolutions, said in a legislative hearing for a bill updating waste facilities’ licensing requirements that EnergySolutions’ Clive facility takes non-concentrated amounts of depleted uranium and has since it opened. But that wouldn’t change with an expanded Clive facility.
“Class A waste, as it’s currently determined, is what we can take in this facility. This would not be able to, as of right now, due to the fact that we don’t have a license to take concentrated depleted uranium, we would not be able to take that under this legislation,” Hill said.
This year the Utah Legislature also removed its specific nuclear waste classification to instead adopt federal definitions. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, depleted uranium is categorized as Class A. But, currently, there’s no indication that the material will be transported from Canada.
Still, advocates worry about the legislative change, especially now that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing its rules under a White House order.
“What happens with aligning to the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) is now what we’re hearing is that the waste will be determined at the site,” Valdez said, “and if it meets Class A then it can come into Utah, no matter what.”
Six out of 8 states that make up the NorthWest Interstate Compact have to approve the plans. Utah would have veto power, Kristen Schwab, chair of the compact said in an October meeting.
In a presentation, EnergySolutions said the state supports the company’s desire to dispose of low-level radioactive waste from Canada at the Clive site.
The Utah Legislature approved an adjustment this year that would allow the state to get up to $30 million in tax for the expansion application, which would be deposited into the Energy Research Fund, and will support Utah’s big nuclear plans.
“The governor is in favor, the Legislature is in favor, and they want this to happen,” Valdez said about the proposal, “but there’s no talk about the general public and if they want this waste coming into our country and into our state too.”

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)Sometimes bad news has more bad news buried inside it. 
Let’s take the tax and spending bill Congress passed in July. Not only will it cause millions of people across the country to lose their food assistance and health care, but it will also unload a mass of new administrative requirements on states. 
In Minnesota, the multiple new mandates — work requirements, additional eligibility and verification requirements – will fall on counties. That’s because in Minnesota, the state sets policy and oversees administration, but the counties do the client contact service delivery part of the job. 
In addition to new administrative requirements, the bill reduces federal reimbursement for the administrative costs of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — i.e., SNAP or food stamps — from 50% to 25%. That means counties now have to pay 75% of the cost of running SNAP.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services is estimating that administering the new Medicaid work requirements will cost the state, county and tribes $165 million annually. The new Medicaid eligibility checks will cost another $5 million. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families estimates that the state and counties will lose $39 million a year in SNAP federal administrative funding, and increased workloads will push that number higher. 
Minnesota counties are raising the alarm. 
Exactly how much of these costs fall to counties, however, is ultimately dependent on decisions by the state. The state could provide additional funds to counties to offset some of these costs. 
One problem, though: The state is facing a looming budget deficit. 
So, if this is a crisis, what’s the opportunity? 
Blow up the system. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Or, to put it more nicely, maybe it’s finally time to seriously reexamine the state-county relationship that sits at the core of how we run our human services system. 
Minnesota hasn’t really examined the state-county system in over 15 years. DHS and counties have attempted several partnership efforts. These are helpful to state-county relations, but lack the resources needed for serious restructuring work. 
The last effort — sparked by a 2007 report from the Office of Legislative Auditor — resulted in little change. 
The OLA was primarily concerned with variation in services and outcomes between counties, as well as inconsistency in state oversight. 
Let’s start with another issue the OLA explored — the one that drives current concerns: The county role in financing human services. 
Minnesota counties have a small role in human services financing, averaging 4-5% of human services spending. But it is not a small dollar amount: $837 million in 2021 (the last year of available data). 
Much of this money goes to support the counties’ role in service delivery — eligibility, assessments, case management, etc. Counties also fund a portion of some services, notably large shares of children’s services (child protection, foster care, etc.) and mental health services. 
This is a problem. Counties have different taxing capacities, which can result in uneven access to services across the state. 
These funding arrangements are largely historic anachronisms — a collection of decisions made over time with no guiding strategy. 
And it’s not getting better. Earlier this year, Gov. Tim Walz proposed shifting some of the cost of disability services to counties.
And now the federal government is dumping their budget problem on counties.  
Layering more random financing responsibilities on top of this mess seems inadvisable.
But you can’t have the money conversation without having the roles-and-responsibilities conversation. What should the state do? What should counties do?
Minnesota is in the minority among states, one of just 10 or so that has counties deliver services. In most states people go to state offices for services. 
Talking with colleagues in other states over the years raised some possible advantages of state administration. For example:  

When service delivery is defaulted to the counties, policy makers may ignore how service delivery impacts the goals of a new policy. With state administration, the people in charge of delivering the services can be more easily engaged in designing the policy. 
State-administered systems can more easily respond to crises or emergencies by quickly reallocating or supplementing staffing and other resources. 
Business processes can be more easily redesigned to fully leverage new technology. 

In the current structure with 87 counties doing any of the things is cumbersome at best. Counties have different staffing capacity and structures, union contracts and IT systems. 
And, they are accountable to locally elected officials who don’t set policy, which falls on the Legislature. 
None of this is to say the counties are doing a bad job or doing something wrong. I worked with counties for decades, and from front line workers to leadership they are dedicated to helping Minnesotans in need. 
Counties value their role in delivering services to their communities, and that bond to local communities is an advantage of county service delivery. 
And, of course, suggesting the state take on more responsibility for service delivery raises its own set of questions – and healthy skepticism. The failure to prevent fraud in multiple human services programs does not engender confidence in the operational capacity of state agencies, and the state’s failure to improve human services IT systems is a significant problem for counties right now.  
But the system may be at a breaking point. And continuing to ignore this — especially in the face of the new federal requirements — is only going to compound the problem. 
These sorts of structural and operational issues often fall by the wayside. They are big and complicated, take lots of resources, and have no obvious political constituency. 
But counties see the steamroller coming. 
And maybe the fraud problem highlights what happens when we don’t proactively deal with basic operational problems. 
When I was in state government we’d sometimes talk about “second term issues” — not the flashy policies of the first term, but the meat and potatoes of good government. 
We never had occasion to talk about “third term issues” — but this seems like a perfect fit.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2189117613-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

WARNING: This story describes allegations of repeated domestic violence and murder. 
This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with WPLN. Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.
On Oct. 7, 2019, a 30-year-old beautician named Temptress Peebles called the Nashville probation office begging for help. Days earlier, her ex-boyfriend Brandon Horton had come up behind her, choked her and kicked her in the face, according to a court document. 
Records show that was just the most recent attack. She had been living in a constant state of fear, her family said, since Horton had broken down her door and pointed a gun at her three months earlier, court records show. He had open warrants for his arrest, so she and her 8-year-old daughter, Khloe, were avoiding the apartment, always taking different roads to get to work or to stay at her family’s house.
Peebles asked the probation manager if Horton could be arrested when he came in for a court date the next day. Horton’s probation file shows the manager said she would try to help. 
But Horton never showed up to court, according to his probation file, and Nashville police didn’t arrest him until it was too late.
Ten days after that call, probation and police records show, Horton waited for Peebles outside her apartment. Khloe told WPLN she remembers seeing Horton pointing a gun at her mom. She remembers throwing her arms around his legs and pleading with him, “no, no, no.” She remembers trying to call 911 while her mom, shot in both legs, lay in the street bleeding to death. 
Horton is now awaiting trial on charges of killing Peebles. He and his lawyer declined to comment for this story. The case file is sealed and the public defender’s office declined to comment further on whether Horton has entered a plea.
Throughout the period when Peebles reported he was threatening and hurting her, Horton was released repeatedly into the community under the stipulation that probation officers would be actively supervising him. But in Tennessee, a state with one of the highest rates of women killed by men, WPLN and ProPublica found that a deadly blind spot in the probation supervision system emerges at a time when experts say domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable. 
When an offender under probation supervision violates the rules by being charged with a new crime or being found with a firearm, for example, a warrant may be issued for their arrest. When law enforcement serves that warrant, the offender can either end up behind bars or back out on probation while awaiting a court date. 
But between the time a probation violation warrant is signed by a judge and when it is served, probation officers stop conducting any in-person supervision: For a high-risk offender, this means probation officers are no longer holding three in-person meetings per month; they also no longer conduct a monthly unannounced home visit to look for drugs and guns. That period of suspended face-to-face checks can stretch for months — in one instance, for more than 400 days. 
In Horton’s case, he remained free, armed and dangerous for three months.
An excerpt from one of Peebles’ protection order petitions against Brandon Horton alleges that Horton was involved in an incident with a weapon and that he is armed. Image obtained by WPLN and ProPublica.
That pause of in-person supervision is spelled out in the Tennessee Department of Correction’s standards of supervision. Between 2019 and 2022, WPLN and ProPublica found at least six people, including Peebles, were shot to death during the gap in oversight. All were young Black mothers, ages 20 to 31. One victim was a cheerleading coach and a mom of two. Another woman was shot while her 2-year-old daughter lay on the bed nearby. In a third case, a mother of three was found in a creek days before Christmas with a purple domestic violence bracelet around her wrist. Their deaths left 12 children without their mothers. 
TDOC declined to make any probation officials available for this story. In an emailed statement, Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said that “supervision remains active” for offenders who have warrants but “the objective changes.” Instead of ensuring offenders are abiding by the rules of probation, she said, officers help to bring that person into custody by sharing relevant case information with law enforcement. Gallagher confirmed there is no in-person supervision during that time. 
This blind spot is one of the ways that the state failed to stop offenders from harming domestic violence victims. WPLN and ProPublica examined hundreds of fatal domestic violence shootings between 2007 and 2023 in Tennessee’s five most populous cities. The reporting, which expanded on our earlier investigations into Tennessee’s lax enforcement of gun prohibitions, found that among these fatal domestic violence shootings, at least 86 people — about 1 in every 4 — were allegedly killed by a suspect who was legally prohibited from having a firearm. Sixteen of those suspects were also on probation. 
In a Second Amendment-friendly state like Tennessee where laws make it easy for more people to carry firearms in more places, little can stop a person intent on getting a gun, even if they are legally barred from doing so. One backstop is the state’s probation officers, who are in close contact with violent, high-risk offenders and can search homes for prohibited weapons without a warrant if they have “reasonable suspicion,” TDOC said. 
According to the department’s own documents, a probation officer’s mission is to ensure public safety. In cases where there is an open warrant, the department relies on law enforcement to prioritize the arrests of probation violators and on judges to incarcerate repeat violators instead of releasing them back into supervision and the community. The result: Some offenders like Horton return to the street. 
“The system did her wrong,” Peebles’ mom, Karen Peebles, said. “If the police department had did their job, and the probation office had did theirs — I think it could have been prevented.” 
 The red flags

Peebles’s friends and family called her Chippie because she had a high, singsongy voice, like a chipmunk. She was loud, funny and always smiling. Almost every night, Peebles talked to her mom on the phone, and she never missed a Sunday dinner.

Her family said she started dating Horton around 2018, giving in after he had pursued her for years. She was hesitant, in part because of his criminal history. Horton had just started 10 years of supervised probation after he pleaded guilty to facilitation of second-degree murder in a robbery where a man was shot and killed. 
“Even when she saw the red flags, she would just try anything in her power to try to make him better,” her cousin Princess Pinkston said. “She felt like she could save everybody.”
The probation department classified Horton as a high-risk violent probationer, which meant that every month his probation officer was required to see him face-to-face three times, conduct a home visit and check to make sure he hadn’t been arrested. This kind of supervision is more intensive and time-consuming than what low-risk offenders get.
In some probation departments across the country, probation officers are assigned either high-, medium- or low-risk offenders. Experts say this allows specialized teams to focus on intense monitoring of a smaller caseload of high-risk offenders, while lower-risk probationers are left to newer officers. 
“It’s like the medical profession,” said Susan Rice, former president of the American Probation and Parole Association. “If you’re a specialist doctor and you do only the high-risk heart surgeries, you’re not going to have as many clients as a general practitioner who sees everybody that comes in with a runny nose.” 
But in Tennessee, officers handle a mix of high-, medium- and low-risk offenders. And Tennessee’s probation offices do not have specialized domestic violence teams or training. A report from victim advocates more than a decade ago said these changes could save lives in the most dangerous cases. “This report should be viewed as a guide for where to begin changing policy,” the report reads, “and by doing so, ultimately reduce the occurrence of domestic violence homicides in Nashville-Davidson County.”
Rice said it is common practice nationwide to have mixed caseloads in probation departments. In an email, TDOC said the same, adding that all officers are “trained in areas like situational awareness and de-escalation techniques to identify warning signs and manage conflict.” 
Most of the 16 alleged suspects who WPLN and ProPublica found were both prohibited from having a gun and under supervision by the probation department were deemed high or moderate risks by TDOC. 
In addition, all 16 were under supervision in Memphis or Nashville, the state’s busiest offices. In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data. 
Horton was assigned to the Nashville office, eventually coming under the supervision of probation officer Derrick Finch, who had been on the job a little more than a year at the time. Finch told WPLN that at one point he had more than 100 offenders in his caseload. Records show the department fired him in 2024 after seven years on the job for reporting that he conducted a home visit with an offender who was in custody at that time. Finch said he thought he had conducted the visit when he was entering his case notes at the end of the month. 
“I got let go because I couldn’t keep up with the caseload anymore,” Finch explained in an interview with WPLN.
By early January of 2019, Horton had been on probation for about a year. His relationship with Peebles was fracturing and she was referring to him as her ex in court records. She joined her own family dinners less frequently, and when she did show up, her mom said, something was always off. She would wear long-sleeved shirts, even in the middle of sweltering Tennessee summers. Once she arrived on crutches, claiming she had fallen down the stairs. Another time she had a black eye, and told her family that a door had swung back and hit her.










If this guy wants to change, we can help him. But if he doesn't — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do? 


– Probation officer Derrick Finch


Multiple studies have shown that the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are trying to leave their abuser, often turning to the courts and law enforcement for protection. 
But the case notes in Horton’s probation file seem to only scratch the surface of what her family suspected was happening behind closed doors. The case notes show Finch ticking through a standardized assessment of Horton’s progress, noting his body language, behavior and next steps. 
“Offender reported as directed.” 
“Offender was calm, alert and oriented.” 
“Offender seeking full-time employment at this time.”
“Offender advises he is in process of moving in with his mother.” 
“Will advise offender next report date.” 
Finch said the department wants officers to have a rapport with the offenders they are supervising, “but who’s got time for that? It’s very hard to do everything they want you to do, because there’s so much to do.” 
He said when a “problem child” arose in his caseload, there was not much he could do about it. 
“If this guy wants to change, we can help him,” Finch said of probationers. “But if he doesn’t — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do?”
 A slap on the wrist 

In a court document, Peebles alleged that on Jan. 12, 2019, Horton went on Facebook Live and said he would kill her before he saw her with another man. He called her multiple times, she wrote, then showed up at her house, blocking her car with his. They started arguing. He punched her twice in the head. She ran to her car to escape and he chased her, she wrote. He tore the windshield wipers off of her car and used them to strike the glass as she cowered inside the locked vehicle. Horton fled when she called police.
What followed was a string of actions by probation officers, law enforcement and the courts that left Horton free and Peebles afraid.
The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department filed a domestic assault charge against Horton. MNPD arrested Horton and searched his home for weapons, according to probation records. He paid a bond to get out of jail while awaiting his court date. 
According to TDOC policy, Horton’s arrest on suspicion of domestic assault required Finch to file a report and request a warrant for a probation violation. 
That policy says that warrants for violations posing “an immediate and/or imminent threat to public safety” should be requested “as soon as possible.” Finch submitted a violation warrant to his supervisor and requested a judge sign it on Jan. 22, 2019, according to probation records. 
Once a judge signed it, the warrant was sent to police, who arrested Horton two days later. But at a court hearing, Peebles failed to appear to testify on the assault charge and the case was dismissed. Her mom said that Peebles did not show up because she was afraid, and that Horton had threatened her if she pursued charges.
“The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence,” Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office, said. “If the evidence isn’t there, we have no choice, we can’t go forward.”
For this reason, the Nashville Office of Family Safety has called for the district attorney’s office to rely more on evidence such as 911 calls, body camera footage or forensic exams instead of just victim testimony.
Once the assault charge against Horton was dropped, the probation violation that was based on those charges was dismissed. Horton remained in the community under Finch’s supervision. 










The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence. If the evidence isn't there, we have no choice, we can't go forward. 


– Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office


And it didn’t take long before the process started all over again. 
On Jan. 28, 2019, Horton was arrested in nearby Marshall County. Law enforcement officers reported finding four bags of a white substance believed to be cocaine on him, as well as a stolen Glock 26 9 mm handgun. 
Being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with the intent to sell is a probation violation, as is being a felon in possession of firearms. 
So, records show, Finch requested another probation violation warrant to bring Horton in front of a judge. Horton was arrested and released on bond the next day.
Despite Horton’s status as a high-risk offender, his multiple arrests in a month and his possession of a prohibited firearm, Judge Jennifer Smith returned Horton to probation supervision instead of incarcerating him. In a statement to WPLN, Smith said she cannot comment on previous decisions.
In at least two other domestic violence gun homicide cases in 2021 a probationer was caught with a gun prior to the shooting — even though they were prohibited from having a firearm because of a prior conviction and because they were on probation. As with Horton, judges did not revoke their probation for being found with a gun.
“There are people who are telling us over and over again with their actions that they have no desire to change,” said Becky Bullard, deputy director of programs at Nashville’s Office of Family Safety, about abusers on probation who continue to perpetuate harm. “And when someone is waving that flag to us to say, ‘Hey, I’m out here practicing all of these high-risk behaviors with someone I’m supposed to care about,’ that is someone raising their hand and telling us that they’re about to murder.” 
Shari Bryant was a Nashville probation officer from 2020 to 2025, and she said she left the job to become an accountant. She said it was common for someone to continuously violate probation with few consequences. Even in these high-risk, violent cases. 
In one of the case files TDOC provided in response to WPLN and ProPublica’s record requests, a Memphis offender named Torian Williams was sentenced to probation for aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon. He was classified as a medium risk and charged while on probation for having two guns. He would go on to shoot and kill his 20-year-old girlfriend Demya Gordon in 2021. For that crime, he took a plea deal for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was released to probation again. During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives. Williams died in 2025. 
“Obviously, they’re not learning their lessons, right? They just keep getting a slap on the wrist,” Bryant said. “They keep getting out and getting away with it.” 
That revolving door allowed Horton to remain on probation and return to the street again. 
 He is going to kill me

Months before she was killed, Peebles was in the bedroom of her apartment when she heard a loud boom at the back door. It was a stormy summer night, July 13, 2019. 
“I got up walked to the door seen Brandon with a gun,” she wrote in a court document. He pointed the gun at her, and she ran out of her apartment. A neighbor later told the court that she was awakened by gunshots that went through her roof, her walls and her mirror. The neighbor, peeking through the blinds, saw Horton running with a gun in his hand. A few moments later, she saw Peebles climbing down a tree.
When police arrived, they could not find Horton. Metro Nashville Police Department charged him with felon in possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. And, for the third time in less than a year, Finch requested a probation violation warrant for Horton’s arrest. 
Temptress Peebles requested a protection order against Horton in July 2019 after he showed up at her home with a gun. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica.
Then, as is spelled out in TDOC’s standards of supervision, Finch stopped supervising Horton in person until police could arrest him. In the past, police served the warrant in a matter of days. This time, it would take three months for the police to catch up with Horton. For those three months, all that was required of Finch was a once-a-month check for arrests in the computer system. Police would not arrest Horton until after he allegedly killed Peebles. He has been behind bars ever since. 
Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon. 
“It’s kind of a messed-up process,” said Rice of the American Probation and Parole Association. “Do we really want that period of supervision to stop if they’re not incarcerated during that time?” 
In the six cases of domestic violence homicide that occurred during this supervision gap, WPLN and ProPublica found the time between when a warrant was issued and when police made an arrest stretched from as few as nine days to as many as 425 days. In all six cases, the alleged offender was put on probation for a gun-related offense. 
In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves. But in Tennessee, officers must contact law enforcement. TDOC said while probation officers cannot make arrests themselves, they work with local, state and federal law enforcement, sharing information such as “addresses, photographs, known associates, and other leads” to assist in locating the offender.
When asked why it took so long to serve warrants in cases like Horton’s, the Metro Nashville Police Department said that “wanted persons frequently change where they stay or leave town and they are often difficult to locate.” MNPD said it works closely with probation officers to serve offenders if they continue to come in for office visits or when they show up for their court dates. 
MNPD said it has one documented attempt to serve Horton’s violation warrant between the time it was issued in July and Oct. 17, when Peebles was killed. That attempt was on Oct. 9. Police said no one answered the door at Horton’s address.
Peebles requested another protection order against Horton in October 2019. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.
“Detectives spend their days researching people with outstanding warrants so they can arrest them,” said Debra Fessenden, chief policy adviser with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, an agency that handles warrants for Memphis. “No one is ignoring the warrants.” 
She said that not all intelligence leads to a timely arrest. 
“It’s not unusual — because of resources, training and protocol — that law enforcement decides, ‘We’ll just serve this when we pull someone over’” for a traffic stop, said Julia Weber, a California-based expert who trains law enforcement and probation departments on dangerous domestic violence cases. 
“What I tell communities is we have to recognize how dangerous a decision that is.” 
In her final days, records show that Peebles was increasingly aware of how much danger she was in.
She had already called the probation department once for help getting Horton’s warrant served at his Marshall County court date. Days later, on Oct. 11, she called again to say that Horton had failed to appear in court “because he spoke to officer finch and was told that he would be taken into custody at that time on his warrant,” the probation file notes. The manager wrote that Peebles was upset and that Horton was threatening to hurt her. 
In an interview with WPLN, Finch denied warning Horton.
“Everything that could have been done was done from our end,” Finch said. “Once that warrant is filed, there is nothing else that we can do.” 
Six days after Peebles’ final call to the probation department, Horton allegedly shot and killed her outside of her apartment while her daughter, Khloe, struggled to call for help. Horton was arrested the next morning, and Smith, the judge who had allowed his release, later revoked his probation. 
“Chippie should be here with her child, with her mom,” said Pinkston, Peebles’ cousin. “She had told you many times, ‘No, he’s serious. He is going to kill me.’ … Now it’s too late.”

Khloe is in high school now. For a long time after her mom died, Khloe said, she heard the gunshots in her sleep. She lives in her mom’s childhood bedroom to feel closer to her. 
She’s starting to fully understand the ways the system did not protect her mom from Horton. But the 14-year-old says she has lived each day since her mom’s death struggling with a guilt she cannot shake.
“I always felt like her death was on me,” Khloe said, remembering how she had forgotten her phone in the kitchen that day, so they returned to the apartment to get it. “If we would never went back to that house … maybe she would have still been here.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20250904-DeShazer-TN-Guns-Probation-02_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

Two Terre Haute hospitals that once competed for patients will soon operate as one system under a newly approved merger that state officials said will expand care and cap prices — although critics warn the deal will eliminate competition.
The Indiana Department of Health greenlit the closely watched merger between nonprofit Union Hospital and for-profit Terre Haute Regional, owned by HCA Healthcare, creating a single hospital system in the Wabash Valley, Gov. Mike Braun’s office announced on Sunday.
IDOH’s decision will allow the Vigo County hospitals to combine operations, but under state oversight.
It marks the first hospital merger approved under Indiana’s 2021 Certificate of Public Advantage, law which allows the state to regulate consolidated hospital systems in exchange for supervision over pricing and service access.
The approval also follows months of public debate and opposition from federal antitrust officials who warned the merger could raise costs and limit patient choice.
“The result of this merger will be lower prices and more healthcare services available to residents of Terre Haute and Vigo County because of the strict operating terms and conditions that Union Hospital accepted,” Braun said in a statement. “This will bring long-term improvement to the community’s health outcomes.”
First test of Indiana’s hospital oversight law
The hospitals’ first COPA filing in September 2023 was pulled back in November 2024 after state and federal regulators raised questions about the merger’s projected benefits and oversight terms. The application was resubmitted in February with new details on price caps, service guarantees and oversight terms.
IDOH officials acknowledged in a 13-page approval brief that the merger would result in a near monopoly for inpatient hospital care but called the coupling “presumptively anticompetitive” because it gives the combined system control of nearly all inpatient hospital care in Vigo County.
Story continues below.
COPA.Determination.2025
 
Department leadership said the merger was only approved after Union Hospital agreed to a set of “comprehensive final terms and conditions” intended to offset the loss of competition.
Those conditions include caps on prices, requirements to maintain both hospitals and emergency departments, and detailed oversight and reporting provisions. The state will monitor compliance annually and can impose penalties or revoke the COPA if the hospitals fail to meet their obligations.
The COPA term lasts five years for general compliance and up to ten years for pricing oversight, according to the department’s determination.
One of the key pricing requirements limits the merged system’s commercial rates to an average of no more than 265% of Medicare rates for the same services. Another “site-neutrality” rule prohibits Union Hospital from reclassifying off-campus clinics as hospital facilities without state approval — a move that would otherwise allow higher billing rates.
The department also required Union Hospital to maintain both hospital campuses, continue providing major services such as trauma care, obstetrics, chemotherapy and intensive care, and invest in facility upgrades. The hospitals must file quarterly and annual reports with IDOH, the attorney general, and the legislature detailing pricing, quality, and access metrics.
Federal and public opposition
Even so, federal antitrust regulators under both the Biden and Trump administrations opposed the merger.
In September 2024, staff from the Federal Trade Commission urged the state to reject the COPA, warning it would “likely impose higher costs and could lead to worse healthcare outcomes for Indiana patients, as well as lower wage growth for hospital workers.”
FTC staff said the combined system would control nearly 74% of commercially insured inpatient services in Vigo County.
The agency reaffirmed its opposition in March 2025, saying the revised COPA “presents the same problems as before,” including risks of higher health care costs, reduced innovation, and lower wages. The FTC also noted there was no assurance the commitments made under state supervision would remain in effect after the COPA term expires.










This repackaged COPA application presents the same problems as before. Competition consistently results in better outcomes for patients and workers than consolidation subject to COPAs. The Indiana Department of Health should deny this attempt by Vigo County’s only two hospitals to eliminate competition and avoid antitrust review.”


– Clarke Edwards, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Policy Planning


In April, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said he was also concerned the merger would hurt competition in Terre Haute.
“We all understand that hospitals face distinct challenges, but consolidation at the expense of free-market competition is not the way to address those challenges in this case,” Rokita said earlier this year.
In a written statement, the attorney general’s office added, “IDOH must soon decide to either deny the merger or permit the consolidation and monopolization of Terre Haute’s only two hospitals.”
Public comments submitted to the state reflected similar concerns. At a public hearing held in May at Ivy Tech Community College in Terre Haute, about two-thirds of the 245 attendees supported the merger, while roughly one-quarter opposed it, according to IDOH records.
Dozens of written comments posted online by the department additionally warned that the merger would leave residents with fewer choices.
“This buy out has to be stopped. This will eliminate the health option for care in the Wabash Valley,” one commenter wrote. “Leaving the worst health care organization as the only alternative for residents. … Residents should not be left with NO CHOICE! How can we allow the monopoly of our health care?” 
Others expressed concern about potential job or benefit changes for hospital employees.
Supporters, including local business leaders and community groups, said the combination would stabilize the region’s health care system and preserve services that might otherwise close if Terre Haute Regional remained independent.
Ongoing oversight
Union Hospital and Terre Haute Regional representatives said in their application that the merger was necessary to sustain access and improve health outcomes across the six-county region.
They noted that Terre Haute Regional had faced “significant operational challenges” and reductions in service lines in recent years, and that the merger would bring a unified management structure and lower overall costs.
Story continues below.
COPA-2025-Application-Reduced
 
The hospitals pledged to keep both campuses open and to adopt Union Hospital’s lower-cost pricing structure systemwide. They also committed to tens of millions of dollars in capital investments at both facilities and to expand financial assistance programs for uninsured and underinsured patients.
Under the approval, Union Hospital must submit an implementation plan within 60 days and begin quarterly reporting to IDOH. The state will also appoint two representatives to Union Hospital’s board during the COPA term to help monitor compliance.
Some states back hospital mergers despite record of service cuts, price hikes

If IDOH determines the hospitals are not meeting their obligations, it can order corrective action, impose fines, or revoke the COPA entirely.
The department’s approval summary said the merger is expected to “improve the health outcomes, healthcare access, and quality of care” in the area — but only if the hospitals meet the terms and if “the aggregate benefits outweigh any disadvantages attributable to a potential reduction in competition.”
Union Health President and CEO Steve Holman called the approval “an opportunity for growth, expanded services and improved health outcomes for those we serve.”
 “This journey has been about far more than the purchase of a hospital,” Holman said in a statement. “From the beginning, we knew we wanted to protect more than 500 high-paying, high-skill healthcare jobs in the Wabash Valley. This will also come with an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to improve healthcare outcomes for our region — including access to care.”
“This was never simply about acquiring another hospital,” he continued, “it was about ensuring that we didn’t lose one, and that our community’s access to quality healthcare would be protected for generations to come.”
Molly Callahan, chair of the Union Health Board of Directors, said the merger would allow the hospitals to “combine those resources and expand the quality of health care we provide.”

DemasA Michigan nonprofit with ties to one of the state’s largest energy companies is accused of participating in a dark money scheme to funnel money into an effort to overturn the governor’s COVID-19 emergency powers, according to a complaint filed with the Michigan Department of State.
Brought by Bob LaBrant, an attorney and former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and filed by Mark Brewer, an election attorney and former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, the complaint alleges Michigan Energy First, a dark money group linked to DTE Energy, violated the Michigan Campaign Finance Act by working to funnel $100,000 into the Unlock Michigan campaign in 2020. 
In 2024, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced criminal charges against two fundraisers for their alleged participation in a scheme to funnel political contributions to the Unlock Michigan ballot initiative, through two nonprofits tied to former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake), the result of an investigation into campaign finance complaints also filed by LaBrant and Brewer. 
Unlock Michigan aimed to repeal the law Gov. Gretchen Whitmer used to issue emergency health orders during the pandemic, with the majority of funding for the effort stemming from Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, both 501(c)(4) nonprofits.
Groups using a 501(c)(4) designation are deemed to be social welfare organizations that, according to the IRS, cannot directly participate or intervene in political campaigns. However, they can raise money for ads that don’t expressly endorse or advocate for any particular candidate or ballot question, but instead “educate” voters on various issues. Most importantly, 501(c)(4) nonprofits do not have to reveal their donors or otherwise reveal where their money comes from.
Heather Lombardini, the head of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, was one of the two individuals charged for allegedly encouraging businesspeople and political funds tied to large businesses to contribute to the group, with the intention of moving those funds to Unlock Michigan to support its signature collection efforts.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced charges related to Unlock Michigan, Feb. 21, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
In their new complaint, LaBrant and Brewer argued Michigan Energy First’s donation to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility was intended to support Unlock Michigan, citing text messages and emails disclosed in court as part of Lombardini’s preliminary examination in which the chief of staff in DTE’s Corporate and Government Affairs Division in 2020, Pam Headley,  helped to facilitate the donation between the two groups. They also referenced exchanges between Lombardini and Shirkey regarding the check for the donation.
“The Attorney General’s office went to court and received an investigative subpoena to obtain [Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility] emails, bank records, and documents,” The complaint notes. “With this treasure trove the period of donor and anonymity ended. Very few major donors contributed directly to Unlock Michigan choosing instead to funnel their secret funding through [Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility] including [Michigan Energy First].” 










It’s very difficult to sort of fully believe the utility’s line, which is that there’s...separation between the two entities.


– Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the Energy and Policy Institute.


During the 2022 election cycle, Michigan Energy First contributed $200,000 in support of another ballot question committee, Voters For Transparency and Term Limits, which supported a “yes” vote on Proposal 1, which modified term limits for the Legislature and required its members, as well as the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and attorney general to file annual public financial disclosure reports.
Brewer and LaBrant said this shows the group is “fully capable” of directly donating to a ballot question committee directly, writing that “unlike the funding of unlock Michigan, there was no strategic need for [Michigan Energy First] to keep their contribution hidden using a conduit.” 
While speaking with the Michigan Advance, Eric Doster, attorney for Michigan Energy First, said “This is an absolutely baseless and meritless complaint. That’s my only comment.”
When asked about the complaint and DTE’s relationship with Michigan Energy First, Ryan Lowry, a spokesperson for DTE said the company complies with “all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”
“While DTE has contributed to Michigan Energy First (MEF) in the past, we can’t speak on behalf of MEF or the contributions the organization makes,” Lowry said in an emailed statement.
Who is Michigan Energy First
Launched in 2014, Michigan Energy First is registered as a social welfare nonprofit. In its 2023 tax filings, the organization says its purpose is to “Educate legislators and the general public on the issues facing Michigan, and to advocate citizen participation & obtain grassroots support for public policies relating to federal, state or local legislation and ballot questions.”
Michigan Energy First is headed by Andrew Coulouris, DTE’s vice president of corporate & government affairs, while DTE’s manager of regulatory accounting, Theresa Uzenski, serves as the group’s treasurer. Frank Fountain, who served on DTE’s company’s board of directors, is listed as a director in the group’s annual report with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
Since the group’s inception, DTE representatives – namely lobbyists and executives – have sat on its board, Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the Energy and Policy Institute told the Advance on Monday. 
Between Sept. 1, 2024 and Aug. 31, 2025, DTE contributed $8 million to Michigan Energy first, according to the company’s annual nonprofit contributions report. Contributions to social welfare nonprofits like Michigan Energy First are often hard to track down. 
Weinmann also pointed to the emails released through Lombardini’s court case, noting that Headley had no known affiliation with Michigan Energy First. According to the Energy and Policy Institute’s review of the exchanges revealed in court, Renze Hoeksema, who served as Michigan Energy First’s President in 2020, and as a longtime lobbyist for DTE, was the one who instructed Headley to coordinate the exchange.
“It’s very difficult to sort of fully believe the utility’s line, which is that there’s, you know, separation between the two entities,” Weinmann said. “And I think the emails that came to light as part of that court proceeding really sort of affirm that there are bigger questions here about the depth of the relationship between DTE and Michigan Energy First.” 
Dark money – or political spending where the source of money isn’t publicly known or disclosed – is used to avoid transparency, Weinmann said, and any effort to demystify or unmask the flow of that money is beneficial to the public. 
These types of schemes aren’t new, Weinmann said, pointing to a ballot initiative aimed at barring utility companies and government contractors from making political contributions as a response to concerns about corporate spending in politics. 
To the extent that this complaint can bring visibility to concerns about dark money and, if a violation is found, bring accountability and recourse, that is a win for transparency and political integrity in the state, Weinmann said.

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The PAC backing Republican Jay Ashcroft’s 2024 bid for governor improperly coordinated with his campaign on a letter attacking his opponents, according to a consent agreement approved by the Missouri Ethics Commission.
The Committee for Liberty, which spent $2.9 million promoting Ashcroft’s losing effort, must pay $536 and avoid future violations, states the agreement posted Oct. 15 on the commission’s website.
The Committee for Liberty and Ashcroft for Missouri both paid $5,361 each to produce and mail a letter dated March 8, 2024, and marked as paid for jointly by the committees. The consent agreement states that Committee for Liberty should have either reported it as an in-kind expense on behalf of Ashcroft’s campaign or an in-kind donation from Ashcroft’s campaign.
If there is another violation, the agreement states, the commission can seek a fine of the full amount of the expense.
The agreement said Ashcroft’s campaign also did not report it as either an in-kind donation or an in-kind expense on behalf of Committee for Liberty. 
Ashcroft, who was secretary of state at the time, was running against then-Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and then-state Sen. Bill Eigel. Kehoe won the primary and is now governor. Eigel came in second and is running to be St. Charles County Executive.
The March 8 letter labeled Kehoe as a closet Democrat and Eigel as a “political gadfly.”
Ashcroft ran a distant third and is now working as an administrative law judge hearing workers’ compensation appeals.
Democratic attorney and lobbyist Jane Dueker filed the complaint in May 2024, citing the failure of either committee to report it properly. She also complained that the value of the donation to Ashcroft for Missouri exceeded the limit of $2,825 from any donor.
Dueker declined to comment on the outcome of the complaint. She noted that the portion of the complaint against Ashcroft’s campaign has not been resolved.
PACs like Committee for Liberty can accept donations of any size. Candidates are allowed to make joint fundraising appeals seeking money in limited amounts for the campaign and unlimited amounts for their PAC.
That is where the coordination must end. Neither the official committee nor the PAC are allowed to influence the other’s campaign strategy or tactics.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ashcroft-III-20240229-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 06:56:11.564229

Tony Evers and Veterans Affairs Sec. James Bond spoke an event for veterans in the state Capitol on April 22, 2025. (Photo via Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Facebook page)As Wisconsin policymakers honor Veterans Day Tuesday, the state continues to grapple with diminished resources for its most vulnerable veterans, those who are struggling with homelessness.
Debate in the state Capitol continues over the closure of sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls for the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP), which provided support to veterans on the verge of or experiencing homelessness, including those who have been incarcerated, unemployed or suffered physical and mental health problems. 
Republican lawmakers recently proposed that the state create a new grant match program to help support homeless veterans. But some are expressing doubt that the bill would fill the gaps left by the recent closures, especially since it would rely on nonprofit organizations to start their own programs. 
Coauthored by Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), AB 596 and AB 597 would direct $1.9 million to be used for a state grant match program. 
To receive the funds, a nonprofit group would need to be participating in the federal per diem program, which currently provides about $82 per day per veteran housed to groups that offer  wraparound supportive services to homeless veterans. The bill would offer state matching funds of $25 per day per veteran.
Finger pointing over funding continues 
The closures of the Green Bay and Chippewa Falls facilities were announced in July after lawmakers chose not to provide additional funding in the state budget for the programs. Both  sites closed their doors in September. By that point, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs said it was able to find new places for each resident, including some who moved to a Union Grove site and others who were transferred out of state. 
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau had warned in a memo that without funding the sites would be at risk of closing, though the recent reaction of lawmakers who sit on the budget committee gave the appearance that they missed that warning. Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers had called for additional funding and the Department of Veterans Affairs said staff had discussed the issue with the chairs of the Joint Finance Committee. Still, one member of the committee, Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee), said at a recent public hearing on the new bill that she was “absolutely blindsided” by the announcement of the closures.
While a handful of lawmakers have advocated for giving the department the additional funding to reopen the sites, the new Republican proposal takes a different approach that would limit the department’s direct involvement in the program.
Since the announced closures, some Republican lawmakers have blamed the Evers administration for not using money in the Veterans Trust Fund to keep the sites open and instead sending that money back to the general fund, even as the agency has said it can’t spend funds without the Legislature directing it to.
“There’s money in the account. It’s fully funded in the exact same way that it was funded last year. [Evers] just suddenly declared… he wasn’t going to use the trust account anymore,” Wimberger told the Wisconsin Examiner after he introduced the new proposal.
The Veterans Trust Fund receives general purpose revenue allocations from the state, though it doesn’t function as a big pot of money that can be used for anything. The funds have specific purposes, such as to be used for administrative costs and the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program. 
According to Joseph Hoey, assistant deputy secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the agency did use money from the trust fund to pay for administrative expenses to keep the buildings used for veterans’ housing in “good working order.” He said it was a legitimate use since the buildings are owned by the department and could be considered administrative purposes, but that wouldn’t be the case for other costs related to the program. 
“We cannot use that money to pay [Lutheran Social Services] or to run the VHRP [Veterans Housing Recovery Program] because there is a separate appropriation for VHRP,” Hoey said.
Wimberger and Republican lawmakers have also noted a 15% increase for veterans housing  in the recent budget. The Department of Veterans Affairsnoted that amount fell short of the $1.95 million that was requested by Evers to keep the sites open. 
Unclear whether new proposal would fill gaps
Wimberger told the Examiner that a grant program would be “a lot simpler” and require “less of a direct monitoring” by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Hoey said he sees the proposal as “the first step in leaving this up to nonprofits and ultimately spending less state resources on homeless veterans.” He also expressed concern about whether the approach would fill the gaps left by the closures of the two sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls.
There are currently four entities that would be eligible to apply for the new grant program: Porchlight Inc. in Madison, Rock Valley Community Programs, Inc. in Janesville, as well as Center For Veterans Issues Ltd. and Guest House Of Milwaukee, Inc., which are both in Milwaukee.
“As you see from the locations of those organizations that are providing these services, they’re not meeting the need in other parts of the state, and WDVA was,” Hoey said. “I think we as a state have a commitment when people sign up to protect our freedom, I think we have an obligation to care for them, especially when they’re struggling.”
Hoey told lawmakers on the Assembly Veterans and Military Affairs committee at a hearing on the bill that the additional $25 per veteran likely wouldn’t be enough to encourage outside groups to open up new programs. He said it is estimated that it costs about $139 per day to house each participating veteran. 
“$83 is barely enough to house a veteran, let alone feed them, provide them with counseling and training that they need to get back on their feet, and it’s not enough to make the programs work,” Hoey said. “That’s why we asked for such a large amount in the last budget because these programs are just slowly getting harder and harder to operate.”
Lutheran Social Services, which was helping to operate the now closed sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls, could not do that work with $25 from the state, Hoey added. 
“We provide the facilities for them, so they’re not suddenly going to, in Green Bay, open up their own homeless shelter, because they don’t have the facility,” Hoey told the Examiner. “They have no way to pay for it, and the [grant and per diem payment], even with the bonus, probably wouldn’t cover their costs. It’s wishful thinking.”
Hoey also told lawmakers that it is possible the money would not actually lead to additional funding for participating nonprofit organizations. 
“Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe it is possible that all or part of the $25 state payment would be clawed back or offset by the federal VA,” Hoey said. “It’s the way the program is written at the federal level. It penalizes the programs for getting other state or government money.” 
Rep. Rob Summerfield (R-Bloomer) said it is a good bill and pushed back on the idea that only four organizations would be eligible.
“We have one entity in Eau Claire that would be eligible for this, but there’s no money,” Summerfield said. “They’re not going to commit til we actually put this in the statute, get the funding into it, so just to say it’s just going to be four entities — that is incorrect. It, maybe, is correct, but you cannot say that it’s going to be. It could be 10 more. We could have ones in Superior, Lacrosse, Eau Claire, Green Bay, including Milwaukee.”
Hoey told the Examiner that the proposal is at best an incentive for private organizations to apply for the federal grant and start a program from scratch. 
“It would be years before this could result in homeless transition services being provided for veterans anywhere other than in the Milwaukee and Madison areas,” Hoey said. 
The agency had previously said it could get the VHRP sites restarted within a year if the state provided the funding for the programs. 
Asked in an interview whether he is concerned about the prospect of nonprofit groups not opting into the program and being able to fill the present gaps, Wimberger said, “Oh sure, of course.”
“I wish DVA would have used the money we gave them, but this is, this is in response to the executive — Gov. Evers and his administration — just simply refusing to spend the money,” he said. 
Other proposals in limbo
Two proposals that would provide the Department of Veterans Affairs with funds to restart the closed sites remain in limbo.
A Democratic bill, coauthored by Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) , Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) and Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick), would provide $2.6 million for veterans’ housing.
Another bill authored by Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) would provide $1.9 million.
Jacque’s bill passed committee on Oct. 8 and is available to be scheduled for a floor vote in the Senate. It has not received a public hearing in the Assembly. 
Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concerns about whether the new bill will be effective in filling the existing gaps. 
“If your objective is to fix the problem that we’re now lacking services for homeless veterans in northern Wisconsin” either a bill drafted by Republican Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) or a Democratic bill, both of which provide funds to the now-closed facilities, “does the trick,” Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) said in an interview. “[Wimberger’s] bill does not.” 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said at a press conference that Republican lawmakers had “walked away” from the solutions that would actually fix the problem and were trying to “rewrite history.” 
“Our veterans deserve better than political games. They gave everything for our country, and the least we can do is make sure that they have a safe place to live, recover and rebuild their lives,” Emerson said. “It’s time to stop pointing fingers and actually fix this problem.” 
Wimberger said he didn’t sign on to Jacque’s bill at the time because it was “premature” when it was introduced. 
“It’s not like I’m opposed to it… It’s not like a bad thing, but I don’t, I don’t feel like I want to be extorted to pay for a program twice this. This method just solves the problem without playing this politics with homeless veterans,” Wimberger said of his own proposal. 
As for Wimberger’s proposal, Jacque said in October that he was still “gathering information on what the likeliest real world effect would be” if it were adopted. He also said he was waiting to hear back from the Department of Veterans Affairs on their plans to submit a emergency supplemental funding request to the Joint Finance Committee to address the situation. He said that “could be the quickest option for a positive resolution.”
Hoey said the agency is thankful for Jacque’s work on the issue. 
“We greatly appreciate [Jacque’s] willingness to keep going — to keep trying to get the funding for this program,” Hoey said. “This is something that he believes in and it’s not lip service.”
However, Hoey told the Examiner that the agency is not sure the funding request would meet statutory requirements and be an appropriate avenue for providing the funding given that the Legislature purposefully didn’t include the funding in the budget. 
He said the agency is unsure the current situation would constitute an emergency as it would be used to restart a program, not keep one going, and the agency is also currently grappling with a deficit. The agency’s last such request related to the veterans’ housing and recovery program, submitted to the Joint Finance Committee in March, was never taken up by lawmakers.

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers on Monday advanced legislation that would launch the most comprehensive overhaul of New Jersey’s regulation of charter schools in 30 years.
The bill advanced by the Senate Education Committee on Monday would outright ban for-profit charter schools, require them to post a range of documents online, and impose residency requirements for some charter school trustees.
“We have not looked at charter schools as a whole legislatively in this committee since the 1990s, so this is an opportunity where we’re trying to do that,” said Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth), the panel’s chair and the bill’s prime sponsor.
NJ teacher workforce stable, but pipeline still thin, report finds

The bill comes as New Jersey charter schools have faced scrutiny after reporting revealed top officials were paid far more than their counterparts at traditional public schools, including, among others, a Newark charter school CEO who was paid nearly $800,000 in 2024.
The proposal, which Gopal said was the product of a year of negotiations, would require charter schools to post user-friendly budgets that include the compensation paid to charter school leaders and school business administrators. They must also post existing contracts.
Charters would be required to post meeting notices, annual reports, board members’ identities, and facility locations online. Some critics have charged that charter schools routinely fail to provide notice of their public meetings.
The legislation would also require the state to create a dedicated charter school transparency website to host plain language budgets, 990 disclosure forms filed with the IRS, contracts with charter management organizations, and a list of charter schools on probation, among other things.
It would also ban fully virtual charter schools.
“We support the bills as a step forward in holding all public schools in our state accountable for fiscal and transparency requirements that will ultimately best serve our students,” said Debbie Bradley, director of government relations for the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association.
The two sides remained at odds over the membership of charter school boards.
Charter critics argued residency for those positions — which, unlike traditional public school boards, are largely appointed rather than elected — should mirror those imposed on regular public schools.
In New Jersey, school board members must live in the district they serve. That’s not the case for charter schools, whose trustees face no residency or qualification limits under existing law.
The bill would only impose a residency requirement on one-third of a charter school’s trustees, and rather than forcing them to live in the district, the bill would require charter trustees to live in the school’s county or within 30 miles of the school.
That language was criticized by statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association, which has called existing law governing charter schools outdated and flawed.
“School board representation should remain primarily local, and when we mean local, we don’t mean within a 30-mile radius. A 30-mile radius of Newark could include Maplewood, South Orange, communities that don’t necessarily represent what Newark looks like as a community,” said Deb Cornavaca, the union’s director of government relations.
Charter school supporters said their boards need flexibility because their leadership has broader responsibilities than counterparts in traditional public schools.
“Running a charter is a little different than running a traditional district. You need experience in school finance. You need to fundraise a bunch of money on the front end because you’re not getting paid on the front end,” said New Jersey Charter School Association President Harry Lee, adding they also needed familiarity with real estate and community experience.
Amendments removed provisions that would have required charter school board members to be approved by the state commissioner of education, though the commissioner retains sole power over whether to allow the formation of a new charter, a power that gives the commissioner some veto power over a charter’s board.
Gopal acknowledged the 30-mile residency rule was a sticking point and said legislators would discuss it before the measure comes before the Senate Budget Committee. Earlier, he warned the bill was likely to see more changes as it moved through the Legislature.
Some argued enrollment in charter schools should be more limited by geography, arguing that out-of-district enrollments that are common at New Jersey charters could place financial strain on the students’ former district.
Most per-pupil state and local funding follows students who enroll in charter schools, even if their departure does not actually decrease the original district’s expenses because, for example, those schools still require the same number of teachers and administrators.
Charter operators said that would make New Jersey a national outlier and argued that a separate provision that would bar new charter schools when there are empty seats in existing area charters should come out of the bill.
“It could be read as a moratorium on charters, so we want to revisit that provision,” Lee said.
Such vacancies could exist for various reasons, they argued, including student age distributions.
Alongside that measure, the panel approved separate legislation that would bar charter schools from setting criteria to enroll students, ban them from imposing other requirements on a student randomly selected to attend, and place new limits on how such schools can enroll children from outside their district.
That bill would also bar charter schools from encouraging students to break with the district. Some opponents have charged that charter schools push out low-performing students to boost their metrics.
The committee approved the bills in unanimous votes, though Sens. Owen Henry (R-Ocean) and Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic) abstained from votes on both bills, saying they are broadly supportive but need more time to review amendments.

Sandelius (Photo courtesy of Ed Saunders). This Veterans Day will be a little different than the others for Elizabeth Dorothy “Sandy” Sandelius.
Even though she died decades ago, after living what her family describes as a full life mostly spent in California, the Montana-native and World War I hero — and her family — can now say: She has a Silver Star, a medal awarded to those who served heroically during combat.
As one of many Montana women who answered the military’s call for service during World War I as a trained nurse with the Red Cross, Sandelius shipped overseas, volunteered for combat duty, and served on front-line hospitals, nearly losing her life several times. She returned to America with little fanfare and got married to a man whom she secretly wed before deploying, both never knowing if they’d see each other again.
They did. And they raised a family. But even that family, who knew her simply as “Granny,” had no idea that among the records of battlefield heroics, she stood out. According to her relatives, she never recounted her experiences of the field hospital or the wounded.
It was a decade-long journey by one of Montana’s best contemporary historians that culminated in a small ceremony in Los Angeles last year, where Sandelius was awarded the honor, even though many nurses during the “Great War” never got the same recognition as their male military counterparts.

In fact, in what may be a cruel historic irony: Sandelius’ name may have been more remembered had she been killed in action rather than just serving in it. The names of the fallen dead were remembered, often chiseled in the stone of memorials and written in the books of military history.
However, Sandelius’ story follows a common trajectory: Small town girl who becomes a nurse, only to have the country enter into a great global war. Edward Saunders, who has done extensive history of Montana women in the military, especially during the first half of the twentieth century in his book, “Knapsacks and Roses,” said when America entered into the war, there were more nurses in Montana than the military, which only had about 400 (at the time, there were 500 in the Treasure State). The Department of War would send out a call for more than 14,000.
Sandelius answered that call, not once, but three times. She volunteered to be a nurse for the military; she volunteered to go to overseas; and then she volunteered to go to the front lines. None of those things were required.
But it would be her service on the battlefield, in a field hospital that wasn’t much more than a tent, during some of the most intense fighting where she caught the notice of the commanders.
In July and August 1918, Sandelius was assigned to the U.S. 28th Division, which was helping the French infantry stave off German attacks, including those with lethal gas. During the Oise-Ainse offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne, the 28th sustained more than 14,000 casualties.
Sandelius was assigned to Field Hospital 112, near Cohan, about 60 miles from Paris. Saunders recounts that the tented field hospital would receive more than 5,000 wounded and perform more than 200 surgeries.
But on Aug. 10, the Germans stepped up the attacks, and the field hospital was caught.
Even after military commanders had ordered the nurses to withdraw to three miles, Sandelius refused to leave the side of the injured and sick.
“For eight consecutive days and nights, she stayed with her patients, enduring enemy artillery and aerial bombardment in dire and deadly conditions,” Saunders wrote.
Her life could have ended in a multitude of ways during those harrowing hours, but two coincidences should have killed her. Both times, a German warplane — military aviation was still in its infancy — dropped a bomb near the tented hospital, only to have them both fail to explode. One landed approximately 15 feet from her.
While she would survive on a combination of luck and steely determination, Sandelius and other nurses would stay on long after the war’s end on Nov. 11, 1918, helping to care for the sick and wounded.
She returned to the United States in 1919, alive and with little other fanfare. Few even know that she and her husband, Stillwater County soldier C.B. Benbow, had fallen madly in love just prior to entering into the war. Not knowing where they’d end up, or if either would make it out of the worldwide conflict alive, they secretly wed two weeks before she left.
The marriage had to be done secretly, or she’d likely not be accepted for the war effort. On all of her war records, including her dog tags, she remained Elizabeth D. Sandelius, No. 12660, of the American Expeditionary Forces.
In reality, she was Elizabeth D. Benbow.
After the war, she returned to her husband, C.B., who was trained as an early aviation pilot, but never left the states during the war. Sandelius died in May 1983, never knowing her battlefield legacy would be remembered. She was buried in Los Angeles’ National Cemetery.
The cover of “Knapsacks and Roses” by Ed Saunders.
It was Saunders, while researching his book about Montana women and their involvement in World War I, who discovered Sandelius’ story.
“From the centennial of World War One about 10 years go, I first met her in the dusty archives of the Montana state library among many records of Montana women who went to war in 1917,” Saunders said. “As I looked at Elizabeth’s service record in war-torn France, I couldn’t help but think, ‘This gal was in some bad stuff.’ I wanted to find more about her. My walk with her began.”
His inspiration would lead him to research more of her life, and he believed that U.S. military officials had overlooked awards that she more than deserved.
It took nearly a decade of research and a writing campaign. Saunders was able to track down the grandchildren of Sandelius, themselves old enough to be grandparents. They were shocked to learn about “Granny’s” history, and proud that their grandmother, whom they remembered warmly, was also a hero.
They offered letters of support in Saunders’ campaign to earn her recognition, including sending Sandelius’ dog-tags and photos. And they were shocked when the U.S. Army accepted their case for Sandelius receiving the Silver Star.
Saunders, a retired Army colonel who served in combat himself, remembers calling the family when the letter from the U.S. Army arrived.
“We both had tears in our eyes,” Saunders said.
Sandelius was among the first four American servicewomen in the American military history, all WWI Army Nurse Corps nurse, to have been awarded the Silver Star medal for valor in combat.
“The greatest tragedy that can befall an American serviceman — or woman — is not that they may be killed in action, that’s the greatest sacrifice. The greatest tragedy is they may be forgotten: Forgotten in life and forgotten in death by the very same nation they — and I — swore and oath to defend, even at the cost of our lives,” Saunders said. “In the words of the ancient Greeks, Elizabeth helped make gentle the horror which mankind often inflicts upon itself.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Elizabeth-Sandelius-Dog-Tags-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-11 06:56:11.564229

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)On Monday, a group of state and local lawmakers expected to see firsthand the conditions within the Milwaukee Secure Detention Facility (MSDF), a state-run facility imprisoning people for things like probation and parole violations. Lawmakers said the Department of Corrections (DOC) approved the tour, only to back out. It wasn’t the first time that elected officials have reported being denied tours of prisons and jails around the state, many of which continue to produce troubling accounts of the conditions inside their walls. 
“Let me be clear, the conditions in Wisconsin’s correctional facilities are not simply unfortunate,” said Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), standing with other elected officials and community organizers on the steps of the Milwaukee County Courthouse on Monday. “They are unacceptable…We are not going to normalize inhumanity.” 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Madison said that in some incarceration facilities, people may be locked in their cells for 20-23 hours a day for months. “They are denied sunlight,” said Madison. “They’re denied movement. They’re denied programming. They’re denied medical care. They’re denied basic human contact. There are facilities where people can’t even get consistent access to quality hygiene products. Where food is so poor, it does not meet the nutritional needs of grown adults…Where communication with family, the very thing that reduces recidivism, is treated like a privilege instead of a right.” 
Inhumane conditions in Wisconsin’s  jails and prisons, Madison said, is “state-sanctioned violence, and it’s being done in our name and disguised as justice.” Rather than creating spaces where rehabilitation can occur, Madison said, the Legislature has favored “choices related to punishment over rehabilitation, control over care, silence over accountability.” He stressed that “when you run a system on punishment and silence, abuse becomes the operating procedure.” 
That’s why Madison, alongside other elected officials and organizers from Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) and the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, gathered outside the courthouse in Milwaukee to announce a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails. The bills would accomplish a number of things including:

Guaranteeing 180 free minutes of telephone access, 60 minutes of free video calling, and 100 free messages per week to incarcerated people. In-person visits would also not be replaced with video or phone calls, 
Increase wages to incarcerated people to at least $2.33 per hour. In  Wisconsin most incarcerated people are paid anywhere from nothing to 40 cents per hour, 
Guaranteeing at least four bathing periods for people incarcerated in  state and county facilities, 
Providing culturally sensitive products and a $25 a month stipend to help pay for them, female hygiene supplies, and other grooming and hygiene products, 
Guaranteeing up to two in-person visits a week, and allowing incarcerated people to have up to 25 registered visitors who may embrace them for up to 20 seconds before and after visits, 
Requiring that all state and county correctional facilities provide recreational activities, as well as organized and structured programming,
Ensuring that people placed in solitary confinement are given a book, pen or pencil, paper, envelopes, hygiene products, a personal address book, and other supplies within two hours of being placed in restrictive housing, requiring structured programming while in solitary confinement, guaranteeing access to case managers, and providing three 25-minute video visitation periods per week, 
Ensuring that housing units are kept at 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, 
Granting incarcerated people the ability to see the outdoors at least three hours daily, and the ability to be outside and up to three hours a week, 
Creating a public dashboard with status on solitary confinement, prison lockdowns, and complaints, 
Ensuring that lawmakers are able to access prisons and jails for oversight purposes, 
Allowing counties to oversee control of a jail if lawmakers vote to do so, 
And requiring jails and prisons to provide written documents to incarcerated people detailing their rights, and ensuring the document can be viewed and accessed throughout any correctional facility. 

Justin Bielinski, a Milwaukee County supervisor and chair of the Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and General Services Committee, quoted the adage that with great power comes great responsibility and added, “our carceral system is the ultimate power, depriving people of their freedom.” Bielinski said she  fears that “we’re not holding up our end of the bargain and our responsibility to keep people safe and free from harm.” 
Meanwhile, Milwaukee County is running out of space in the jail and Community Reintegration Center (CRC). “So it’s more important than ever that the conditions inside these facilities are the best that we can make them so that when people come out, they are not worse, that they are at least the same, if not better.” Bielinksi said. She added, “The Sheriff’s Office has been resistant to every attempt that we’ve made to offer change, offer oversight within the jail.” Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who was also in attendance on Monday, said he has also battled the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to visit the jail and improve conditions there.

Although the county board can pass resolutions, they are not binding and do not usurp the authority the sheriff has over the jail. “We cannot force change inside of that facility,” said Bielinski. “And so we do need state legislation to help us out with that…We know these things are going to cost money, but we cannot let money be the excuse for treating people in a way that is less than human. And if we can’t find the money, then we shouldn’t be locking this many people up.” 
Bielinksi recalled the string of deaths inside the Milwaukee County Jail from 2021 to 2022, which led to a third-party audit of the jail. Yet in that audit, Bielinksi said, the county didn’t address the specific circumstances that led to the deaths. Among the people who died were 21-year-old Brieon Green and 20-year-old Cilivea Thyrion, whose deaths were both ruled suicides despite  their families’ insistence that jail staff were at the very least negligent in their care. Green and Thyrion’s loved ones joined local activists in calling for reform to the jail and sheriff’s office. 
December will mark three years since Thyrion died. Kayla Patterson, a member of the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, highlighted the deaths and riots at the jail in recent years. “And we will continue to see that until the sheriff and her office are held accountable,” said Patterson. “This legislative pack should represent one of the first steps in standing with the people of Milwaukee for jail oversight that works with them, and not against them. For real transparency input into how our loved ones are kept while in custody. In the Alliance there’s a slogan we use: ‘In your custody, in your care.’ These are not just inmates, but community members that deserve dignity 24-7 during their time in the jail.” 
Conditions within state prisons have also been under the microscope. Last year, the warden of Waupun Correctional and eight other staff members were charged with crimes related to the treatment and neglect of people within the prison, which may have contributed to a string of four deaths from 2023 to 2024.

The deaths included Dean Hoffmann, ruled suicide by hanging, Tyshun Lemons who overdosed on a substance containing fentanyl, Cameron Williams who complained of breathing issues and was found unresponsive in his bed, and Donald Maier, who died while in solitary confinement of dehydration and malnutrition. Water to his cell had been shut off, and correctional officers allegedly knew that Maier’s mental condition was worsening, that he had not eaten for days, and had begun drinking sewage water. In 2025, Waupun warden Randall Hepp was convicted of a misdemeanor in Maier’s death, and fined $500. Hepp pleaded no contest. 
The DOC didn’t respond to a request for comment, and the story will be updated with any reply from them. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said at the press conference, “We invest, as a state, millions of dollars in folks who are in our care. And they should be coming out on a trajectory of success to make sure that they are finding a job, finding a community, and the only time they think about their time incarcerated is in the rear view mirror, in the past tense. Unfortunately, the way that we have this set up is a broken ‘tough on crime’ idea that once you touch the criminal justice system it is cruel to you, it diminishes you, and it never lets you go.”

Androne Lane has experienced the struggles Larson described. He came home in 2018 after spending time in several prisons including Waupun, Green Bay, Red Granite and  Fox Lake. “I think it was important for me to come out and speak today because being a returning citizen, this bill or this movement that these guys are pushing to me is like a basic, like our own constitution for returning citizens,” Lane told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re not asking for a lot, we’re asking for dignity. We’re asking for humanity.” 
The priorities outlined in the bill package cover things that would help incarcerated people heal and become whole, Lane said. When people return home from prison, Lane continued, “How do you get a community to accept them coming back in there? And what does that look like for encouraging the community or an individual coming back to recover something that wasn’t replaced?” 
Lane and other advocates say there needs to be a “community care plan” for people returning home from incarceration. When Lane returned home, he told the  Examiner, it took a while for him to accept that he needed mental health therapy. “I think one of the hardest things for individuals is to ask for help, not knowing what help you need,” he said. “When I came home there was a lot of things that was on the surface that I had to deal with. But there was a lot of things inside that I didn’t know I was dealing with.” On the surface, Lane was unemployed and deeply stressed, but on the inside he was struggling with the trauma of being molested as a child, and he didn’t know how he’d be accepted in the community. “What does mental health look like for us? What does wellness look like …and what is this ‘whole’ that everybody is working for?” 
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) (Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa), said the bills embody important work for Wisconsin to take on. “I hate living in a state where we lock up so many people and have so little regard for how those people live their lives,” Arney told the Examiner. “It’s a heartbreaking, enraging type of situation…When I look around and say, ‘What’s as bad as slavery was?’ And I think of the conditions of incarceration in the state of Wisconsin. That us as the United States, we’re addicted to locking people up, and in Wisconsin we do it even more so and even worse than in other states. And even though it costs a tremendous amount of resources, there’s so little willingness to engage in what those resources are here for, what we’re doing. Why does it cost so much to treat people so badly? Why do we, everyday, just put up with the fact that we’re somewhere on the order of 5,000 people over capacity?” 
Although “conditions of confinement” sounds like a “sterile” term to Arney, she said,  it’s not. “It’s human beings that are being treated at torture-level conditions, and I just can’t stand that.”

Through Wednesday, Nov. 12, the public can participate in an online survey to help guide the future of freight and passenger rail systems in Idaho, the Idaho Transportation Department announced in a news release. 
According to the department, the plan evaluates the condition and performance of Idaho’s existing rail system, identifies challenges and opportunities and covers strategies to strengthen infrastructure. 
The plan also addresses public safety and railroad crossings.
“We want to hear from Idaho communities about how rail infrastructure is working today and what improvements would make the biggest difference in the future,” Freight Program Manager Caleb Forrey said in a written statement. “Your feedback will help us better understand statewide priorities and shape a plan that reflects Idaho’s needs.”

The Idaho Statewide Rail Plan will be used to support grant applications and coordination with the Federal Railroad Administration, but does not allocate funding for specific projects, Idaho Transportation Department officials said. 
The Idaho Statewide Rail Plan and grant opportunities are important to the railway system in Idaho because there is no dedicated state source of funding for freight or passenger rail aside from matching funds available for federally funded rail crossing improvements, transportation officials said. 
Feedback gathered from the online public survey will be incorporated into an updated Idaho Statewide Rail Plan, which officials said they expect to release in spring 2026. The updated plan will then be used to guide discussions and partnerships at the community, state and federal levels. 
A summary of the 2013 Idaho Statewide Rail Plan is available online.

The case, which could have major implications for voters in Wyoming, is expected to be appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. 
The post District court upholds Wyoming’s closed primary election system, ‘sore loser’ laws appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s closed primary election system and its so-called “sore loser” laws do not violate the state’s constitution, a district court judge ruled Friday in a lawsuit brought by a group of voters earlier this year. 
“The challenged statutes regulate the manner in which political rights are exercised but do not abridge the rights themselves,” Laramie County District Court Judge Nathaniel S. Hibben wrote in his decision. “The court likewise finds the challenged statutes do not deny Plaintiffs equal protection of the laws.”
First filed in August 2024, the lawsuit initially sought to overturn the state’s prohibition on failed primary candidates appearing on the general election ballot as independents, known as a “sore loser law.”
In April, the complaint expanded to challenge Wyoming’s closed primary election system as well as its crossover voting ban, which limits how and when voters may affiliate with a political party. 
The plaintiffs, who included voters, former political candidates and a retired state lawmaker, argued that such laws violate the Wyoming Constitution’s guarantee of “political equality” and “impermissibly discriminate against candidates and voters not affiliated with a major political party.” 
Those laws, however, are a “valid exercise of legislative power,” Hibben ruled, adding that his decision is likely not the last in the case. 
“As the parties made clear at argument on these motions, this dispute will inevitably be resolved by the Wyoming Supreme Court,” the ruling states.

In the meantime, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity as the state’s top elections official, called the ruling “a huge win for the integrity of Wyoming’s elections,” in a statement.  
“Protecting the election process by banning crossover voting has been a key part of our administration’s election integrity agenda,” Gray wrote. “With this ruling, it is confirmed what we, the citizens of Wyoming, knew all along: these laws are constitutional, and pivotal to ensuring election integrity in Wyoming.”
The ruling
It’s not the court’s job, Hibben wrote, “to question the wisdom of the Legislature’s policy choices,” but rather “to determine whether those choices transgress the clear boundaries established by the Wyoming Constitution.” 
The court found the sore loser law does not cross that boundary in part because it does not completely disqualify a candidate from running after losing a primary. 
“The availability of the write-in option, explicitly protected by the Wyoming Constitution, ensures that the right to seek office is not extinguished,” Hibben wrote. 
For decades, Wyoming had a partially open primary election system. That meant voters were restricted to casting ballots in races that aligned with political party affiliation, which they could change on election day and during most of the early-voting period. 
However, that changed in 2023 when lawmakers created a 96-day blackout period leading up to the primary election in order to ban what’s known as crossover voting — a popular practice for Democrats in a state where Republicans dominate politics. Democrats often vote for more moderate Republicans, which has frustrated some on the right. 
The new timeline lines up with the candidate filing period, meaning voters must affiliate with a party before the slate of candidates is finalized. 
Altogether, plaintiffs argued that the deadline and Wyoming’s closed primary system unconstitutionally burden their fundamental right to vote.  
However, “the right to vote in a primary is not an absolute right to vote for any candidate, but rather a right to participate in the selection process of the political party with which one has chosen to affiliate,” Hibben ruled. 
In their filings, the plaintiffs pointed to the political reality that many races in Wyoming are decided in the primary election due to the Republican Party’s dominance. 
“This perspective, however, invites the court to step beyond its constitutional bounds. It is not the court’s function to diagnose the causes of the political imbalance, much less to prescribe a remedy,” Hibben wrote. “Rather, the court must champion the very political rights plaintiffs exercised: the freedom to organize, to advocate, to persuade, to seek public office, and to cast a vote for the candidate of their choice. Plaintiffs had, and still have those political rights and privileges.” 
Plaintiffs now have 30 days to file an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Candace Machado resigned after a frustrating year, columnist Kerry Drake writes, but urged people to run for office if they can handle the personal risks.
The post Ex-Evansville mayor’s experiences show why good folks don’t get into politics appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s a given that most progressive candidates don’t fare well in Wyoming politics. 

Opinion

But what happened during Candace Machado’s time as Evansville’s mayor shows that serving in office after overcoming the obstacles to win an election can be a nightmarish experience.
When she resigned last month, people on social media told her, “You signed up for this.”
“We signed up to serve the community, not to be the emotional punching bag for every adult who never learned effective boundaries, coping skills and emotional reasoning,” Machado told me a week after she left the nonpartisan office. 
Media attention has focused on the most controversial event of her tenure as mayor, the vitriolic response after she planted miniature Pride flags on the lawn of the Evansville Town Hall in June. She wanted to show the town’s support for the LGBTQ+ community.
Resident Jeremy Brown responded by drawing swastikas in chalk on the sidewalk to protest the Pride flags. Brown said at a council meeting that he did it as an act of free speech to register his complaint that having ideologies displayed on government buildings “brings division, hatred and just, basically, we don’t need that in our town.”
What Evansville doesn’t need are people who respond to a message of inclusion, love and respect for LGBTQ+ individuals with the symbol of a Nazi regime that persecuted and ultimately killed more than 6 million Jews and millions more based on their political beliefs, sexual orientation, and mental or physical disabilities.
Brown apologized if his swastikas “offended anyone.” He and a few supporters demanded Machado’s resignation at town council meetings, and Councilman Greg Flesvig even presented a letter of resignation for the mayor to sign. 
It’s a sad chapter in the history of Evansville.
The former mayor stressed to me that the Pride flag incident wasn’t the reason she resigned, but part of a long series of events in which — “behind the scenes” — she often felt demeaned and ignored by peers who didn’t want to rock the boat. 


“I don’t want my five years [in office] to be representative of one choice and one decision that I made,” Machado said. “There were a lot of choices and decisions I made that moved the town forward.”
Machado’s political career began when she ran for the Evansville Town Council in 2020 and won. Mayor Chad Edwards resigned in February 2024, and she said the town’s police chief and fire chief talked her into seeking the interim position. Machado, who didn’t see eye-to-eye with members on many issues, said she was surprised when the town council unanimously voted for her.
Machado has an impressive record, including completing her predecessor’s prime project, a $1 million park playground. She also helped secure a nearly $9 million grant from the Wyoming Business Council for the Mesa Natural Gas Solutions manufacturing plant in Evansville. It’s scheduled to be completed next summer.
Machado, a social worker for 18 years, is also proud that the council approved mental health and counseling services for first responders who have experienced trauma.
“I’m a pretty progressive person, and I had a lot of people who just wanted me to fit in a box,” she said. “They wanted me to conform and stick with the status quo, and don’t shine light on things that are bad for the community.”
Machado describes Wyoming’s political system as “broken.” I agree with her assessment: “If you don’t fall in line with how Wyoming politicians think and behave, you’re the bad guy,” she said. “You get quietly silenced; they shut you out. They’ll make it look good in public settings, but you get to know very quickly how you land with everything.”
Machado said she has supporters, but they can’t always be at meetings. “It’s a very lonely space to be in. At the end of the day, when things get tough and challenging, it’s just you and your family to pick up the pieces,” she related.
There were two reasons I interviewed Machado. I wanted to see what advice she would offer future candidates and if she feels people can make a positive impact on the state’s politics even if they don’t throw their hat in the ring.
“People have told me they’ve seen what I went through the last 21 months, and they want no part of it because they didn’t think they could do it,” she said.
Machado said this isn’t the end of her political career, and she’s leaving the door open to seeking another office in the future.
I’m glad Machado isn’t staying quiet. “I feel like I can do a lot of great work as an activist and an advocate in the community,” she said. “It’s what I’ve been doing for the past two decades.”
Machado hopes the Wyoming Freedom Caucus falls out of favor with voters and is amazed many candidates won’t even admit they’re members, but notes it makes it difficult for opponents to pin down their views in a campaign. “If you’re going to be honest with your constituents, at least tell them which party line you affiliate yourself with,” she said.
Even after her resignation, the ex-mayor still encourages people to get involved in the political arena as candidates. But Machado cautions that they need to go in with their eyes wide open.
“If people are going to run for office, they need to know how it’s going to impact them and their families,” she advised. “And they need to know what it’s going to be like when they’re in office.”
That doesn’t make it easy for people to recruit wary candidates in this ultra-red state, but she speaks the truth.

Joe Kelly, from left, to celebrate Guard recruitment and retention legislation. Dec. 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska was set to lead the way July 1 with a new statewide criminal justice diversion program for eligible veterans through evidence-based treatment and case plans. But lawmakers delayed the rollout for two years in the face of growing budget woes.
It’s not yet clear whether Nebraska lawmakers can meet that later timeline and find the roughly $4.7 million in annual funding the state court system says is needed to start by July 1, 2027. 
Several current and former state lawmakers called the funding decision “disappointing” and “incredibly problematic.” Another former lawmaker said she wasn’t in a position to “second guess” a response to the state’s fiscal situation.
Former State Sen. Tom Brewer, the sponsor of the 2024 bill who represented north-central Nebraska, said in a May text that lawmakers had made a “conscious decision” to ignore veterans’ problems and wait to support those who have stumbled and need a second chance.

Brewer said the budget had already passed by the time he learned about the proposal. 
“I believe that veterans will come with a vengeance against those senators and the governor if they take a law that was debated and voted on and made into law and then ignore it for their convenience for the budget,” Brewer said in May.
Unlike the state’s four specific Veterans Treatment Courts operating in the three most populous counties and in central Nebraska, the new veterans justice program would support all veterans, not just those who were honorably discharged. The Veterans Administration can’t reimburse the treatment costs for veterans who are dishonorably discharged, which increases state costs.
‘Playing politics with our veterans’
Two other lawmakers, both lawyers, joined Brewer this week in criticizing the spring decision as a continuation of not fully supporting veterans who have come home from serving.
“It’s unfortunate that we’re playing politics with our veterans,” former State Sen. Justin Wayne, the then-chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee who partnered with Brewer on the bill, said this week.
“We don’t uphold our end of the deal, and those folks are left holding the bag,” said State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, another supporter of the law who works in the public defender’s office in Lancaster County.
State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha. Aug. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
This week, just before Veterans Day, Brewer added: “I think that they’re forgetting a group of folks that shouldn’t be forgotten.”
The law, passed 44-0 in April 2024, directed the Nebraska Judicial Branch to provide targeted statewide support to eligible veterans if a veteran’s military service-connected conditions contributed to their alleged criminal actions.
“The ones that are struggling are the ones that have seen some of the worst action, and sometimes, figuring out how to beat those ghosts that you’re dealing with, you need a little extra help,” Brewer said.
Last in, first out
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen identified the specialized diversion program as one of many “last in, first out” laws his budget proposal targeted for cuts or delayed implementation in January. 
The recommendations temporarily ensnared or ended programs, including a prescription drug donation program costing about $500,000 annually, a step which was later reversed. The moves were part of Pillen’s answer to a then-projected$432 million state budget deficit through June 30, 2027.

The total budget hole lawmakers ultimately filled was much larger. In the case of the veterans justice program, Pillen’s recommendations argued the state court system could support veterans without additional taxpayer dollars.
“The Supreme Court is able to develop a process independently to address critical veteran justice needs,” Pillen’s budget recommendations said in mid-January.
Because the veterans justice program didn’t start until July 2025, lawmakers would have needed to find the $9.4 million for this budget year. 
The Appropriations Committee accepted Pillen’s recommendation, and the full Legislature accepted the change with little opposition in the first year after legislative term limits sent home Brewer, Wayne and another lead supporter, former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area.
An effect of term limits
The trio joined a large class of lawmakers in 2017 and were among the most influential senators in recent years. Linehan chaired the Revenue Committee, and Brewer chaired the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. 
Brewer, a 36-year military veteran with two Purple Hearts, served six combat tours in Afghanistan and two in Kyrgyzstan. He has since led nine volunteer missions to Ukraine after Russia invaded the country in February 2022 and plans to return next month.
The decorated veteran said he thought the decision would have been harder and that it would have been different had his class of “natural supporters” still been there. He said he would have “obviously fought it tooth and nail.” 
Nebraska leads with new veteran justice program, aiming to steer veterans back to ‘hero status’

But Brewer also expected other military veterans in the Legislature to step up.
“Maybe they didn’t want me barking at them, so they didn’t bother to let me know what was going on with it, but Justin [Wayne] notified me afterwards, and that’s the first I knew about it,” Brewer said.
Wayne said that while $5 million a year is big to everyday Nebraskans, it isn’t for the state budget or for those who have served the country. He said every dollar invested in problem-solving courts today, including those specific to veterans, yields a return of $8 to $10.
“The government put them in an area that caused it, so we as a government should take care of it,” Wayne said. “It’s unfortunate that Nebraska continues to fall behind in that.”
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Brewer said Wayne came to him with the idea for the diversion program in the 2024 session, after bill introductions in their final session, but the two worked together with Linehan and other legislative leaders to find an unusual and speedy path to making it law.
“We weren’t sure if we could get it pushed through or not, but everything clicked,” Brewer said.
Dungan said he has seen and defended veterans facing criminal charges connected to their service. He said he recently attended a Lancaster County Veterans Treatment Court graduation, which was “one of the more moving things I’ve ever seen.”
“I understand that budgets are tight right now, but, again, it comes down to prioritization,” Dungan said. “I think that we absolutely have to prioritize the health and the welfare of vets across this entire state.”
A ‘fair number’
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Appropriations Committee vice chair, was among those who led the committee’s push to accept Pillen’s recommendation for the veterans program. She had told the Examiner during the 2025 session that her budget focuses were infrastructure, public safety and taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves, such as children and older adults.

In one executive session of the budget-writing committee in late March, she told her colleagues she felt the court hadn’t provided the Legislature a “fair number” and had inflated the estimated cost of a veterans justice program.
Armendariz was among those who supported the passage of the program the previous year, as did all other members of the Appropriations Committee at the time. An April 2024 fiscal note estimated the same $4.7 million annual cost that the Appropriations Committee and Pillen wrestled with this spring.
Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke and State Court Administrator Corey Steel told the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee that the court system could not proceed with implementing the new program without the new funding. The plan is to add specialized probation officers, for instance, to monitor eligible veterans.
“I think we’re statutorily obligated to do that work,” Funke told the committee in his first budget cycle leading the court system. “We just don’t have the funding to do it.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Steel told the Examiner in May that the fiscal estimate included roughly $3 million for staffing, $1 million for treatment costs and $500,000 for related information technology programming needs.
If the program had no state funding, it would have needed to go into effect July 1. But Steel told the Examiner in May, “The implementation would be very watered down and not implemented at the expectation that LB 253 was passed.” 
Worsening budget trends
In late May, lawmakers took the extra step of formally delaying the implementation of the diversion program in state law, through Legislative Bill 150. 
The Appropriations Committee almost advanced the delay without a separate public hearing on the proposal, but State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha urged the Judiciary Committee to hold one, partly because neither Pillen nor lawmakers had proposed the delay in the budget or in a separate bill.
With less than 24 hours’ notice, and with the budget having already passed, the Judiciary Committee hosted a short hearing the morning of May 22. It lasted no longer than 15 minutes, said State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair..
“I do not want the Legislature to start a new program without a reasonable plan and proper funding,” Clements testified. He had sponsored the amendment delaying the program’s start.

State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, asked Clements why pushing the program out to 2027, to a new budget cycle for a different set of lawmakers, would be the “magic date.”
“Will you fund it?” DeBoer asked.
“Well, that’s part of the budget discussion. There wasn’t room for it in this year’s budget, and we’ll see how revenues and budgets are in the future,” Clements responded.
Since then, the state’s budget situation has worsened, with lawmakers projected to face another nearly half-a-billion-dollar deficit heading into the 2026 session that ends in mid-April.
Pillen also tried to trim the court system’s budget in late May, attempting to veto $12 million that court leaders said could have shuttered some critical court services, including a separate Veterans Treatment Court in Sarpy County. The Legislature deemed the vetoes had not been properly submitted, prematurely ending the fight and preserving the funds.
‘We’re ready to go’
Clements told the Examiner in May that a “problem” with the veterans justice program was that any veteran would be able to “claim he needs the veterans justice treatment” in any district or county court. He said judges and staff were not trained for that, suggesting a regional hub model as a possible alternative.
“I think the body will be favorable to that, so there’s some time to adjust the program down to what’s workable,” Clements said in a phone call.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
At Clements’ hearing on the delay, DeBoer said she might consider seeking funding for the veterans program in 2026. She confirmed Monday night that she is still considering doing so in what would be her and Clements’ final year. 
Pillen told the Examiner in a post-session interview that his office continued to support veterans statewide, including recognizing those who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II.
“I think that there’s way more to supporting our veterans than just talking about more money,” Pillen said June 3, a day after the 2025 session ended.
Funke, in a wide-ranging interview this month about the judicial branch, said the courts continue to work to design the new veterans justice diversion program, which would supplement the existing state Veterans Treatment Courts. Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and more support those intensive programs designed to reduce recidivism and allow reentry to society.
“Once they say, ‘Yep, go forward, here’s the funding,’ we’re ready to go,” Funke said last week of the Legislature.
‘They didn’t kill it’
A national panel of senior military and criminal justice leaders designed the model policy that Nebraska was the first to pass last year. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, chair of the national Veterans Justice Commission of the Council on Criminal Justice and a former U.S. senator from Nebraska, led the charge with Brewer, Wayne and Linehan.
Minnesota had passed a similar law a few years before the creation of the approach Nebraska adopted last year.
Wayne noted that the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which shares model conservative bills nationwide, touted Wayne and Brewer as bipartisan “policy champions” after the 2024 law. Wayne criticized Pillen and other supporters for breaking their promise.

Part of the reason for the legislation, Hagel said last year, was because of the difficulties of some servicemembers in transitioning back to civilian life. More than 200,000 active-duty members make that switch each year, a number exacerbated by the country’s long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Retired Brig. Gen. David MacEwen, director of the national Veterans Justice Commission and a former Army adjutant general between 2013 and 2015, said in a statement this month that the Nebraska law honors the sacrifices of veterans. 
He said the new diversion program would ensure that those “entangled” in the legal system aren’t “forgotten” in jails or prisons and are supported.
“We understand that putting new laws into practice is never as smooth or as fast as we’d like, but we’re heartened to see that Nebraska remains committed to implementing this important reform,” MacEwen said.
Linehan, while reaffirming the importance of the law she helped champion, said in July that she wasn’t in a position to “second guess” the Legislature’s work this year. However, she said she looked forward to the state’s nationally praised court programs for veterans becoming more robust.
“I have every confidence in the governor and the leaders in the Legislature,” Linehan said. “They didn’t kill it. I’m happy about that.”
Readjusting to civilian life
Linehan, a former chief of staff for Hagel, served in the U.S. State Department between 2009 and 2012, where she worked on the Iraq desk. She worked in Iraq at the Baghdad Provincial Reconstruction Team and, in the end, headed the consulate in Basra after the Army left.

When she returned, Linehan said she was able to adjust back to the U.S., but she noted she wasn’t a young servicemember who spent four or five years in the military, who returned confused as to why others couldn’t understand their situation. She said support for veterans means helping with long-term reintegration, not just when they get off the plane.
“Nobody can understand what it’s like to be deployed,” Linehan said. “So we need to make sure, when we ask people to sacrifice everything, including some their lives and many their health, and especially their mental health, we need to make sure we’re there to help them.”
‘I just hope that our veterans matter’
According to the Council on Criminal Justice, roughly one in three veterans report being arrested or booked into jail at least once. The suicide rate for veterans is approximately 1.5 times higher than the rate among the general population and higher still for veterans who have been incarcerated.
Among all U.S. adults in 2022, there were, on average, more than 131 suicides each day and nearly 18 veteran suicides per day, according to the data reported by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
Nebraska suicide mortality review team proposal, with emphasis on veterans, advances

Brewer said the state’s delay makes him worry about the veterans who need the support the most. He said some worry more about their own struggles than the criminal penalties they face. 
Brewer said a key reason veterans consider taking their own lives is a loss of hope and feeling as if no one cares. He said that was one of the problems he, Wayne, Linehan and Hagel sought to address.
Dungan passed a bill this year to systematically review veteran and general population suicides in the state and analyze ways to make a difference. Pillen supported those efforts. Lawmakers also explicitly banned discrimination on the basis of military or veteran status as part of LB 150.
Wayne said he wants lawmakers to care more about standing by veterans when they are in need or when they make a mistake, to not just make political speeches and appearances on Veterans Day or show up to banquets, but to help servicemembers and their families. He said the Legislature can always find money for things that matter.
“I just hope that our veterans matter enough to this Legislature to fund them.”

Trafficking of a […]","A bipartisan bill in the Wisconsin legislature would impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted of human trafficking. Advocates worry the penalty could be applied to victims.Close up shot of fingerprint paper | Getty ImagesA bill that would require judges to sentence people convicted of human trafficking to at least 10 years in prison, or at least 15 years for trafficking a child, is advancing through the Wisconsin Legislature.  
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud or coercion for labor, services or commercial sex acts. Trafficking of a child includes knowingly attempting to recruit a child for commercial sex acts. The bill would also increase the maximum prison time a person can receive for trafficking. 
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) wrote that the bill “will continue to put a dent in human trafficking in Wisconsin.” Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) listed five cases in which, he wrote, a person convicted of sex trafficking received between six and eight years in prison. It appeared that the cases took place in states other than Wisconsin. 
“AB 265 ensures that these soft-on-trafficking policies never happen in Wisconsin,” O’Connor wrote. He argued that the bill’s mandatory minimums ensure adequate punishment and prevent offenders from doing further harm. 
The criminal justice advocacy group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) and the president of the Wisconsin Justice Initiative oppose the mandatory minimums, arguing that there is a lack of evidence they will be effective at reducing trafficking. EXPO argues in an email to the Wisconsin Examiner that mandatory minimums risk unintended harmful consequences and resources are better spent on areas such as prevention and victim services.  
The LOTUS Legal Clinic in Milwaukee, which works with survivors of human trafficking, expressed concern in a written comment submitted on the Senate version of the bill in September. Executive Director Erika Petty wrote that many of LOTUS’s clients might support the mandatory minimum in principle, but expressed concern about unintended consequences for trafficking victims. 
“Traffickers commonly shield themselves from criminal accountability by forcing their victims — often at a very young age — to post ads, recruit new trafficking victims, and facilitate encounters,” Petty wrote in her comment, which was brought up in the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety. “Thus, the victims themselves become vulnerable to criminal prosecution for human trafficking.”
The bill’s mandatory minimums would apply if a person is convicted of human or child trafficking in adult court, Amber Otis, senior staff attorney with the Wisconsin Legislative Council, wrote in a message to lawmakers on the committee.
Petty argued that under the bill, a victim forced to participate in trafficking of others would fall under the mandatory minimum, just like their trafficker. She provided language for lawmakers to consider; if added to the bill, it would create exceptions to the mandatory minimums that would give judges the ability to hand down lighter sentences or probation to people who offer evidence that their offense is the direct result of a violation of the trafficking statutes.
A 2017 Northwestern University Law Review article made a suggestion in the same vein as Petty’s, proposing that Congress create a “safety valve” for “lead prostitutes,” or “bottoms,” who are both victims and perpetrators of trafficking, to allow them to receive a sentence lighter than a mandatory minimum if certain criteria were met. An article in Anti-Trafficking Review describes a case where a woman named Keosha Jones was both perpetrator and victim of sex trafficking.
Petty wrote that LOTUS attorneys currently had multiple cases involving convicted survivors. The clinic doesn’t handle criminal defense, but LOTUS can work with survivors on their rights as crime victims and see if they can alleviate a survivor’s criminal record, Petty told the Examiner in an interview. A survivor may have a criminal record as a result of trafficking that creates barriers to gainful employment and safe housing. 
While the bill was introduced by Republicans, the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety approved it unanimously, and Minority Caucus Chair Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) and Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) have been added as coauthors. It has since passed the Assembly. 
The Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety approved the Senate bill along party lines, with the committee’s three Democrats voting against. 
People convicted of benefiting from human trafficking or receiving compensation from the earnings of debt bondage, the prostitution of others or a commercial sex act would also receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, or 15 years for benefiting from child trafficking. 
The bill would also increase the amount of prison time a judge could hand down for trafficking and give prosecutors a longer window to charge someone with human trafficking. 
Victims have a defense in court, but concerns remain
The Examiner reached out to Sen. Wanggaard in September about LOTUS’s comment and suggested amendment. Wanggaard aide Scott Kelly said that “we do not believe an amendment is necessary.” 
If a trafficking victim commits a crime as a “direct result” of a violation of human trafficking law, the victim can use an affirmative defense in court. Kelly referenced the affirmative defense and the 2022 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in State v. Kizer, which involved a woman who killed a man prosecutors admitted had sexually abused her. 
The court held that an offense is committed as a direct result of a violation of the human trafficking statutes if there is “a logical, causal connection” between the offense and the trafficking. Other events or considerations must not have played a significant role in causing the offense. 
If a victim is charged and convicted of trafficking, that would mean the victim did not successfully assert the defense, Otis wrote. This could occur if the prosecutor proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not meet the elements of the defense. 
Even with the affirmative defense, Assistant State Public Defender Katie York of the Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office told the Examiner that she thinks the bill puts trafficking survivors at risk. 
York opposes the human trafficking mandatory minimum in general, and said it takes away the opportunity for prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges to evaluate each case based on individual circumstances. York said she thinks judges are well equipped to make decisions and she doesn’t believe that this area of the law needs more specific parameters. 
York said how well the defense can be used to protect a trafficking victim is “largely untested at this point.” 
Also, if there is a situation where a jury doesn’t think the defendant meets the “direct result” standard for the affirmative defense, the trafficking still might have been a contributing factor to the defendant’s involvement in the offense, York said. A judge could take that into account. 
“So they could be found guilty of trafficking, even if they tried the affirmative defense,” York said. “But, if the judge is looking at the full picture when they’re sentencing someone, which is what judges do, they would want to take into consideration how that person got involved in the trafficking.”
If a person got involved in trafficking because they were originally trafficked themselves, that would be an important factor for the sentencing judge, York said. 
A person might have some culpability, without having as much culpability as whoever drew them in or forced them into human trafficking, said Sarah Schmeiser, president of the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 
Schmeiser said prosecutors use mandatory minimums to force plea deals, as someone charged with a crime that carries a mandatory minimum sentence has an incentive to plead guilty to a lower charge with a lower penalty instead of risking the mandatory minimum sentence at trial. 
York thinks traffickers could use the mandatory minimum as a tool to further coerce their victims.
“So if… they say, ‘Hey, I need you to post this on Backpage,’ or ‘I need you to talk to this girl for me,’ or whatever it is to bring them into the trafficking, they’re putting that person at risk of criminal liability,” York said. “And then the trafficker can say, ‘And, now you better be careful and listen to what I have to say, because otherwise, you’re going to get in trouble with law enforcement and you’re going to go to prison for 10 years,’ or whatever the mandatory minimum is.”
Increased penalties 
Under the bill, someone convicted of committing or benefitting from human trafficking would be guilty of a Class C felony, which carries up to 25 years in prison. Receiving compensation from the earnings of debt bondage, a prostitute or a commercial sex act would become a Class E felony, which carries up to 10 years in prison. The mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison would apply to all human trafficking offenses.
Committing or benefitting from child trafficking would become a Class B felony, which carries up to 40 years in prison. Child trafficking offenses would carry the 15-year mandatory minimum. 
More time to prosecute
The bill would also increase the statute of limitations for human trafficking from six years to 10 years, allowing more time for prosecution. During an Assembly hearing, Investigator Luke Johnson of the Racine County Sheriff’s Office said many human trafficking victims struggle to leave their traffickers. 
“It is very easy for victims to be trapped in a life for many years before having a chance to get out or feeling comfortable enough to disclose to law enforcement or anyone else,” Johnson said. 
Of the human trafficking charges filed under the state law between 2018 and 2023, so far 14 charges have led to convictions, according to Wisconsin Court System data. For trafficking of a child, so far, 32 charges have led to convictions. This does not represent the number of people convicted, as a person can be charged more than once in a case. Charges of benefiting from human or child trafficking were less frequent. 
The National Human Trafficking Hotline reports it has identified 1,117 cases of human trafficking in Wisconsin since 2007, with 2,212 victims identified in those cases. There were 445 allegations of child sex trafficking across Wisconsin in 2021.
“It is imperative to note that in this underworld of crime, there are far more cases that are not reported to law enforcement,” Rep. Jerry O’Connor wrote in a comment on the bill. 
Burden of proof 
Senators discussed LOTUS’s comment during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety in September, with Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) raising concern about charging and criminalizing victims. 
Committee chair and Sen. Van Wanggaard said he thinks investigators understand that a person might be coerced to participate in human trafficking. 
Otis’s email to the Senate committee noted that the district attorney has discretion over whether and how to charge someone with trafficking depending on the situation. 
It’s difficult to prove whether someone is a victim of human trafficking, York said. She added that the victim may not identify as a victim of trafficking, and may view their trafficker as a boyfriend or someone they relied on. 
“It’s a challenge to kind of go back and unpack years worth of trauma and history to say, ‘OK, this is what originally happened, and this is how we got to where we are,” York said. 
At times, a plea deal may work out better for the individual than using the affirmative defense, York said, due to the mental toll the defendant would experience from going in front of a jury and speaking about what happened to them. A mandatory minimum limits the ability to negotiate for the client, she said. 
Erika Petty of LOTUS suggested there could be a situation where someone is not ready to identify as a victim of trafficking at the trial stage, but the situation changes by the time of sentencing. 
Petty referenced a law that allows a person convicted of prostitution to submit a motion for a court to overturn their conviction if certain criteria are met, including that the person was a victim of trafficking for the purposes of a commercial sex act. Human trafficking convictions aren’t covered. 
Potentially, a survivor could appeal a decision, Petty said, but “those are all very specific, and have to align with timing and whatever underlying issue wanted to be appealed.”
Whose expertise informed the bill? 
Shortly before the Assembly voted on the bill, Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia) said the bill came to lawmakers from Investigator Luke Johnson. Johnson’s comments state that from 2023 to earlier this year, he had an opportunity to serve on a task force specifically targeting human trafficking and internet crimes against children. 
“I urge any of you that have any trepidation with this bill to sit down with those in the front line that actually do this work and actually see this firsthand,” Wittke said. 
During the hearing in the Senate in September, Drake asked Wanggaard and Wittke if they had reached out to any groups or partners that work with victims of human trafficking outside of law enforcement for input. 
Wanggaard said he didn’t know of any group recently that they talked with specifically about this draft, but said that “we have [done so] for most of the content in this draft.” He said he thinks law enforcement was probably the most vocal “because they’re seeing the same people out there, continuing to reoffend.”
Wittke said he didn’t go to any other groups and that “this came specifically from sitting down with Inspector Johnson.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) expressed concern about “only talking to one entity, and that is law enforcement, and we know that not all of our law enforcement officers have the tools necessary to decipher who those victims are.” 
The bill received support from the Wisconsin Sheriffs and Deputy Sheriffs Association and other law enforcement groups, as well as the nonprofit United Migrant Opportunity Services (UMOS). UMOS’s Latina Resource Center operates the Wisconsin Regional Anti-Human Trafficking Program, which helps victims of labor and sex trafficking. UMOS did not respond to requests for comment.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Veterans Day this year came just days after my 20th reunion with my West Point classmates. I spent the weekend reconnecting with friends — some still in uniform, others like me long since transitioned to civilian life — and was reminded of the shared values that first brought us together. 
I graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 2005 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. My final assignment was at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where I served as a civil affairs officer from 2011 to 2014. Over nine years on active duty, I was humbled by the people who volunteered to serve our country — bound by shared values and a steadfast commitment to the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution.
When I turned 18 and became eligible to vote, I was already a cadet at West Point and soon to be an Army officer. Since that time, I’ve never officially affiliated with any political party. Military service impressed upon me that the health of our republic depends on service members who uphold their oath to the Constitution, even when political tides shift around them  — a principle I’ve carried with me long after hanging up the uniform.
North Carolina is home to one of the largest military bases — Fort Bragg — and one of the largest military and veteran populations in the country. Each November 11, communities gather to reflect on the meaning of service and what it asks of us as a society. It also reminds us of the enduring principles that guide the military and safeguard our democracy: a nonpartisan commitment to serve the nation, mutual trust between civilians and those in uniform, and a clear line between military duties and local law enforcement.
Our military strength depends on deep public trust that service members act in the interest of all Americans, rather than any single party or a politician. Upholding this principle keeps our democracy strong and ensures our armed forces are respected across all divides.
Recent actions across the nation, including here in North Carolina, threaten public trust in the military. The federal government has attempted and, in some instances, succeeded in deploying National Guard troops into major U.S. cities without the approval of state or local authorities to police civilians. These actions are now being challenged in the courts. 
Just last week, three N.C. Congress members urged Governor Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard to Charlotte, citing the federal government’s deployments in other major cities. Tasking service members with missions meant for state and local authorities — many of them politically charged — threatens the military’s nonpartisan role and risks politicizing service members. 
The same principle applies beyond the military to non-military federal authorities. When the government blurs the lines between national defense, law enforcement, and politics, it undermines both accountability and public safety. In North Carolina, for instance, bills like HB10 and HB318 require sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, effectively pulling local law enforcement into federal immigration enforcement. This blurring of roles erodes trust between police and the communities they serve — especially among immigrant communities who may fear reporting crimes — and diverts local policing resources from essential public safety duties. Just as deploying troops for civilian policing threatens the military’s nonpartisan integrity, these laws have the same effect at the local level.
Reuniting with my classmates last weekend reaffirmed that the foundational principles of military service must be upheld at all times, especially when they are under threat. We must recommit to the principle that the military exists to uphold the Constitution and defend our democracy, not to carry out political agendas. 
Veterans, active-duty members, families and civic leaders all have a role in speaking clearly against any attempt to use the military as a tool for partisan gain. This Veterans Day, let’s honor service not only with parades, but by defending its purpose. If you’ve worn the uniform or love someone who has, speak up for policies that keep our military focused on national defense rather than domestic policing.

(Photo by Lexi Browning/West Virginia Watch)As the year winds up, it is imperative that every West Virginian takes a close look at the challenges that we faced, that we endured and that seem to only escalate, with very little reversal. It’s also important to note that so much of these unfathomable challenges did not only happen to us, but to all Americans, particularly those in rural America. Yes, change is certain, but the degree to which we experienced change this year was unprecedented, with a playbook that did not and still does not exist.
What has perhaps been most troubling is what is happening to families, particularly children. Each of us is aware of the knowledge that families, children are going hungry due to the reduction or lack of national and state funding for SNAP recipients. And what makes this atrocity even more incredulous is that it was 100% avoidable, that its political underpinnings created its cause and effect. I’m reminded a bit of the closing scene in the movie, “Crimson Tide.” As the two commanding officers aboard a nuclear missile submarine could not resolve their differences, the head of the tribunal summed it up by saying that while disaster had been averted, they had created “one helluva mess.” The film was released in 1995. Watch it again.
This year, West Virginia’s struggling economy continued, along with energy sector challenges, health care availability and accessibility, lack of affordable housing, and an education system that seems to constantly be put on the back burner, jeopardizing the future of our children. And let’s not forget the talk of data centers and the potential harm that accompanies them. Even the knowing benefits from the loss of funding for the arts contributes to a society’s downfall. And let’s not forget our aging population, noting that over a quarter of West Virginians are caregivers.
The infighting that exists and continues to escalate among those in power, both nationally and in West Virginia, is outrageous. Not working together to resolve differences will always create chaos, affecting those most vulnerable.
Both sides continue to dig their heels in deeper and deeper, until any effort to make amends to a collapsed system leaves them frozen in place, with the citizenry suffering in unimaginable ways.
As the year comes to a close, it is troubling to even suggest that capitulation might very well be the word of the year.

(Photo: John Partipilo)A Nashville judge has rejected one of the state’s legal arguments for refusing to disclose the identities of Tennessee Highway Patrol officers involved in immigration enforcement actions but asked to hear additional arguments before making a final ruling. 
The Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, or TIRRC, filed a public records lawsuit against the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security in August, alleging the agency failed to meaningfully respond to its request for records and video footage involving officers during mass immigration sweeps in Nashville earlier this year. 
The state delayed providing video of the stops and other documents, and heavily redacted the reports it did provide to exclude a host of identifying information that “made it hard to understand what police did and why they did it,” attorneys for the nonprofit argued.
Redactions included the names and badge numbers of officers conducting traffic stops, information that is routinely released to the press and public.
State fights to keep confidential full record of THP participation in immigration enforcement

The state argued that the highly politicized nature of the immigration enforcement activities could make troopers a target of violence or harassment if their names were made public, mirroring arguments by federal officials that immigration enforcement officers need to conceal their identities to protect themselves and their families from harassment and violence. 
In his Friday order, Davidson County Chancellor Russell Perkins rejected the argument that a state “anti-hacking” statute designed to prevent disclosure and disruption of certain government electronic information applied to the records being sought. The state had argued the records sought by the nonprofit group could reveal “operational vulnerabilities” without heavy redactions.
Perkins wrote he needs to hear more on the state’s legal argument that information such as officer names and badge numbers are protected by a separate state law that withholds certain personal information of law enforcement officers from public release.
The law defines officers’ “personal information” as home addresses, cell phone numbers, and the name of day care providers an officer’s child is enrolled in. The law does not specifically cite the names of officers or their badge numbers. 
Immigrant group sues for records, footage of Nashville immigration sweeps

Attorneys for the nonprofit argued that officers’ names and badge numbers, typically displayed on officers’ uniforms, were visible during the traffic stops and do not subsequently become confidential when requested by the public.
“Redactions of any personal identifying information related to (Tennessee Highway Patrol) officers that were not publicly disclosed during the joint operation…should not be publicly disclosed,” Perkins wrote.
“That fact that material is aggregated in a public records response, however, does not convert previously disclosed information, such as badge numbers, into personal identifying information” protected by Tenenssee law, he wrote.
A date for a future hearing has not yet been set.

(Photo by Daniel Finsley/Finsley Creative for West Virginia Watch)Since last year, the city of Wheeling, West Virginia, has allowed homeless people to live in a wooded area along a trail — it’s been the only public property where it’s legal for homeless people to live after the city passed a camping ban. Next month that will change. 
City council voted last month to support City Manager Bob Herron withdrawing the site’s exempted status as of Dec. 1. According to the city’s ordinance, camping can be permitted at the city manager’s discretion. Only one council member voted against the measure. 
Councilwoman Connie Cain made the motion at a regular council meeting Oct. 21. 
“It is my opinion, and I hope that it is shared with my colleagues on city council, that providing such an outdoor area during freezing temperatures and deteriorating conditions is not in the public’s best interest and does not serve the goals of council of health safety and welfare of the community,” she said. 
On Monday, representatives of several homeless services providers from the area were at the camp, trying to help the approximately 70 people staying there get into housing or connect with other services. 
Maryanne Capp, a volunteer nurse with the homeless medical outreach organization Project HOPE, said the people she talked to Monday are intimidated by the prospect of leaving the camp and are unsure what to do. 
“It’s a short notice to get some place to go,” Capp said. “They don’t have solid plans yet, but everybody’s working really hard to try to get them to that point. I talked to several people that are trying to reach out to family to see if they can come and stay with family.”
City officials call exempted site ‘a failure’
During city council’s discussion, Wheeling Mayor Denny Magruder called the exempted camp a “failure,” for its residents and for other people who live in the neighborhood.
Others echoed support for closing the camp. 
“That camp is not a great place,” Councilman Ben Seidler said. “It is a special spot of hell and it is time to close that. Those folks deserve better and they need to be around the resources that are there. That number has increased, not decreased, so what is supposed to happen is not happening.”
Wheeling is one of dozens of cities around the country that have enacted laws prohibiting homeless people from camping on public property. The United States Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon in June 2024. The high court ruled that the Oregon law does not violate the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
Morgantown, Parkersburg, Bluefield, Clarksburg and Princeton have camping bans. The Legislature earlier this year introduced a statewide ban that passed the House of Delegates, but not the Senate.
Opponents of camping bans say they don’t address the causes of homelessness, like a lack of affordable housing and mental illness, and make the problem worse by imposing fines and criminal penalties on unhoused people, making it more difficult for them to get into housing.
Speaking to West Virginia Watch Friday, Cain said she wants to make sure that homeless people don’t suffer frostbite in the cold this year. She said the number of homeless people in the city is growing as shelters in other parts of the state have closed. 
“They can’t be outside in the cold. It’s terrible,” she said. “And my thoughts were, let’s get them inside and then work on a plan. Because that location is not working, not only for the homeless, but for the residents and the businesses. I get calls every day. 
“So my goal is to hopefully, in the next few months, to work with some of the agencies to come up with a better plan,” Cain said. “Because this plan of free reign and nobody’s managing the camp is not working anymore.”
Cain said the city does not intend to reopen the exempted camp, at least at the same location and in the same way. She said she’d like to see the camp be managed and moved to a place that’s not near a neighborhood.
“Nobody has the answers to what we need to do or who wants to actually manage the camp,” she said. “The city is not in the rental business. We can’t be out there all day long watching the camp. There’s a lot of criminal activity.”
Cain added that she lives nearby the camp, and people leave clothes and litter in the area.
“They’re going behind the businesses and going to the bathroom,” she said. “It’s a nightmare for everyone. And I understand and I feel for the homeless, but I have to represent my ward. I have to represent the residents, the businesses. We’ve got to come to some kind of agreement somewhere, because, if not, it’s going to be like California out here. And we can’t afford that.”
City’s low barrier shelter has limited space
People leaving the exempted camp in December may have difficulty finding temporary shelter. The Life Hub operates a year-round low barrier shelter with 50 regular beds and four specialty beds in a former downtown church building. The facility is regularly filled to near capacity, said Tina Morris, one of Life Hub’s cofounders. The city has other facilities, but the availability of beds depend on a person’s circumstances — like whether they’re using drugs, facing mental health issues or fleeing domestic violence. 
The organization is working with the local fire and health departments to add 10 more beds, at least through the winter. As of Monday, they had not yet been approved for the addition. The people who stay at the exempted site are generally a different crowd than who stay in the low-barrier shelter, Morris said. 
“When the camp does close, we’ll have a little bit of space for those that want to come into the shelter, but at the shelter, it’s not a permanent housing solution,” Morris said. “So we are working with folks daily for housing options or treatment bed options or mental health bed options. Our program is designed to make sure that we could provide a handoff or next step for all the guests, and also any kind of wraparound services that they might need.”
Capp, with Project Hope, said she agrees with the city that people shouldn’t be left out in the cold, getting people into housing is not simple. Some of the people there have felony criminal records. Some don’t have an income. 
“I think the hardest part is a lot of the people have mental health issues, and they probably burn bridges with their families anyway, and that’s why they’re homeless,” she said. “Some of them don’t have ID, so they need to get into housing, but they don’t have their ID.”
She added that it’s a bad time of year for people to be out looking for another place to go. It snowed in West Virginia on Monday. 
“We gave out socks, scarves, hats, gloves and they need all that now because now they’re going to be looking,” she said. “They have to be out in the elements looking for some place to go, yeah. So it’s just never easy.”

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public domain)Colorado Democrats in Congress on Monday asked the U.S. Department of the Interior to keep in place a 2024 rule that allows federal public lands to be leased for environmental protection, which the Trump administration intends to rescind.
The Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, commonly referred to as the Public Lands Rule, directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify and support landscapes in need of restoration and created leases that focus on protecting natural areas. The BLM manages more than 8 million acres of land in Colorado.
BLM already had leasing processes in place for extractive industries including energy development, mining and livestock grazing, and the Public Lands Rule balanced those priorities with conservation efforts, rule supporters say.

U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Aurora and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood asked Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and BLM Acting Director Bill Groffy to reverse course on a proposal to rescind the Public Lands Rule, which the Democrats say would make it easier to sell off public lands for mining and drilling. 
“The Public Lands Rule was developed to provide balance in how the BLM fulfills its multiple-use and sustained yield mission,” the letter says. “It ensures that conservation, recreation, and local input are appropriately considered alongside grazing, energy development, and other uses. The rule updates BLM management for the 21st century and puts in place important safeguards to ensure that land health is accounted for in management decisions.”
Hickenlooper led a separate letter from a larger group of Congressional Democrats asking Burgum and the BLM to end its plans to overturn the Public Lands Rule. 
Monday was the last day for members of the public to submit comments on whether they support rescinding the rule. A Center for Western Priorities analysis found that 98% of the more than 40,000 comments submitted as of Monday morning opposed the Trump administration’s plan to rescind the rule. 
Conservation groups including Rocky Mountain Wild, the Western Slope Conservation Center, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Conservation Lands Foundation support keeping the Public Lands Rule in place. More than 100 local elected officials from across Colorado also signed a letter opposing its repeal.
“In La Plata County, our public lands are the backbone of our economy and the heart of our outdoor way of life,” Matt Salka, a La Plata County commissioner, said in a statement. “We celebrated when BLM recognized that conservation of these irreplaceable landscapes deserves equal standing alongside agriculture, energy development, and other uses. We are deeply concerned to see that hard-won balance now at risk.”
The energy industry and agriculture producers support rescinding the rule, according to the DOI. Several farming and mining organizations sued the BLM challenging the rule shortly after it was implemented last year.
The Democrats said that Colorado ranchers, sportsmen, small business owners and gateway communities depend on access to healthy public landscapes, and rescinding the Public Lands Rule could “jeopardize these livelihoods by increasing the likelihood of land degradation, reduced recreational access, and economic instability for rural communities.”
The rule also strengthens the BLM’s ability to protect water resources in Colorado, the letter says, empowering land managers to make watersheds more resilient against wildfire, drought and other threats.
“Eliminating it would leave our water resources more vulnerable at a time when resiliency is urgently needed,” the letter says.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Michael Hauck served as a staff sergeant, combat engineer for the U.S. Army in Germany, Egypt and the states of Georgia and Washington. After 12 years, he called it a career and transitioned to civilian life, but he never expected to find himself homeless at 64.
Hauck received an honorable discharge in 1992. Last year, he moved to Carson, North Dakota, about 70 miles southwest of Bismarck, and was living off his monthly Social Security benefit. But after battling hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees with his bank and bouncing rent checks, he was evicted in August. And the bank closed his account, he said, which hindered his ability to open another one and access his benefits, leading him to the streets. 
“Why I survived is because of the Army, because I don’t quit,” Hauck said.
Hauck is among an increasing number of veterans experiencing homelessness in North Dakota.
In 2024, statewide and community nonprofits provided services to more than 3,800 people who were experiencing homelessness. Of those, 229 were veterans, according to the North Dakota Homeless Management Information System. 
Homelessness among veterans has seen a noticeable increase in the past couple of years, said Commissioner Lonnie Wangen, head of the North Dakota Department of Veterans Services since 2008.
A few years ago, he said the department had enough resources, beds and assistance available to veterans at the time of their requests through statewide and community groups.
“We no longer do,” Wangen said. “I thought we had it licked.”
Since August, Hauck spent three weeks at Burleigh/Morton Detention Center, having been charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing a license plate. He was also admitted to a local hospital where blood clots were discovered in his heart. When he was discharged, Hauck said he had nowhere to go and ended up at Ministry on the Margins, a zero-barrier, overnight homeless shelter in Bismarck.
“I couldn’t get a motel room because I didn’t have a damn ID,” Hauck said.
Staff at the shelter helped Hauck track down a copy of his military separation paperwork, register for primary health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs and transferred his Social Security benefits to a debit card. Hauck was also able to register for a federal housing assistance program through the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the VA.
Kris Morrissette, behavioral health manager at Ministry on the Margins, said they also worked with Community Action Partnership of North Dakota, a nonprofit specializing in low-to-moderate income clients obtaining self-sufficiency, to set Hauck up in a hotel for up to 60 days while he waits for permanent housing.
Hauck is now on a wait list for an apartment at a reduced rent of $270 per month. He and staff are hopeful he will be housed within the next month.
“It just takes a while to get all those services in place,” Morrissette said.
Hauck said he would have never been able to complete all the paperwork for the services he is now receiving without the help of the shelter staff.
“I went from hell to heaven,” Hauck said.

Earlier this year, state lawmakers authorized an additional $500,000 on top of the North Dakota Department of Veterans Services budget during the 2025 legislative session to address an uptick in veteran homelessness. Wangen said the department plans to make the funds available through a grant program that can catch veterans who may not qualify for other federal or community-based programs — those who “fall through the cracks.”
“I don’t like to see people coming back every month to help with rent,” Wangen said. “I really want to look at: How do we get them from point A to point B so they don’t have to come back?”
The homeless services provided in North Dakota include emergency shelter, rapid rehousing, transitional housing and coordinated entry services, which matches people and families to the housing program most suitable to their situation.
Dan Thorstad, chief administrator for the Department of Veterans Affairs, previously worked as a state service officer and veterans service officer for Cass County. He said one issue for veterans, or anyone facing homelessness, is North Dakota’s quick eviction timeline where landlords only need to provide a three-day notice of their intent to evict a tenant.
“You can’t get anything done in 72 hours,” Thorstad said.
If a renter falls behind on rent, he said, they are not able to find new housing until their previous balance is cleared.
“That becomes a sticking point because how do we get them housed now when they owe?” Thorstad said.
Michael Weyrauch, commander for North Dakota American Legion, said he sees higher rent prices as a barrier for veterans to find affordable housing, especially in the northwest part of the state. 
Hauck said he had a message for decision-makers in the state: homeless services need more funding and the process needs to be simplified. 
“I’ve never signed my name so many freaking times in my life,” he said. “And I thought the Army was bad.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hauck also encouraged portable toilets and warming tents stationed in areas where homeless people gather to offer at least a shred of comfort during a difficult time.
In October, Bismarck police cited Hauck for indecent conduct, which stemmed from defecating in public.
“What’s so difficult about putting out porta potties?” Hauck said. “I don’t want to do it, but I don’t have a choice.”
Once he’s back on his feet, Hauck said he wants to help others escape homelessness like he did.
“If you kick them to the curb, then you’ve got to go and pick them up,” he said.
Wangen said any veteran struggling to find housing, or any other services, should call 988, the suicide and crisis lifeline, or 211, the information hotline for housing and other available community resources. He said FirstLink manages both helplines.
“988 will help you with anything,” Wangen said. “Financial problems, legal problems, you need food assistance, rent, all the way to your mental health issues, they can answer it and help you with legitimate resources, which is great, just the one call.”

Bill Lee and Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton are discussing expanding access to private school vouchers. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s budget outlook will determine the number of new private school vouchers the state funds in 2026, according to Gov. Bill Lee.
The Department of Education declined to make estimates during budget hearings on the amount of money it plans to spend on K-12 education for fiscal 2026-27 or the number of vouchers it expects to give out for private school enrollment. 
Lee told reporters Monday he believes K-12 education will see a funding increase but that the state has several months left to make revenue projections for large budget items, including “education freedom scholarship” spending, which provides recipients $7,300 each to enroll at private schools. Both items are funded separately. 
The state spent $144 million this year on 20,000 vouchers, as well as money for one-time teacher bonuses and funds to offset losses for public school districts whose students transferred to private schools.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who voted against the governor’s first voucher program for low-income students six years ago, is supporting a move to double the number of vouchers after the state received 42,000 applications for them this year. 
The law allows 5,000 vouchers to be added if the number of applications reaches at least 75% of the scholarships available the past year. But even that depends on whether lawmakers fund the increase.
Debate over private-school voucher expansion looms in Tennessee

Lee has made no secret of backing expansion, calling it a “priority,” but he hasn’t put a number with the plan.
“We had a huge demand. Tennesseans want it,” Lee said. “It’s something that we’ve understood there’s an over-subscription for, and we should do everything we can to give it to them.”
Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds didn’t propose a cost for the state’s K-12 education funding, which is roughly $6.9 billion this year, or the private-school voucher program during last week’s budget hearing. She declined to speak to reporters afterward. Department of Education spokesperson Ricki Collins said later the figures weren’t provided because they depend on this year’s enrollment. Even though students are three months into the school year, she said it is too early to make an estimate.
Likewise, no estimate could be made on voucher spending until a plan for funding K-12 education is made, she said.
The state is depending more than ever on sales tax revenue to fund the budget after lawmakers reduced business taxes two straight years and gave companies a tax rebate.
Sales tax collections for the first three months of this fiscal year, which started in July, exceeded projections by $49 million, nearly 2%, while corporate tax collections came in $28.6 million below estimates, 3.8% off the mark.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the last two years, OpenDoors has only been able to offer 15 year-round beds in its 1940s Providence rooming house for women and children without a place to stay. But that number will more than quadruple this winter, thanks to a new round of state homelessness response grants.
A total of 49 additional beds will open up starting Dec. 1 to provide temporary relief for OpenDoors clients. The beds are among a total of 281 that will be available through mid-spring 2026 funded by $1.74 million in state grants awarded to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and homeless shelters.
“The house is large enough to house more people than we can currently staff it for,” co-Executive Director Nick Horton recently told Rhode Island Current. 
Funding will provide the beds in time for winter, according to the Oct. 30 announcement by Gov. Dan McKee.
The grants come from the state’s remaining pandemic relief aid and will support new or expanded seasonal emergency shelters operating between Nov. 1, 2025, through April 30, 2026. To qualify for the funding, shelters were required to be open at least overnight.
A little more than $1.15 million will be divided between OpenDoors and five other organizations. The remaining funds will go to warming centers that will be active during only the most severe or inclement weather.
Receiving the seasonal shelter funding are:

Community Care Alliance in Woonsocket: $404,178
Harvest Sanctuary in Woonsocket: $114,022
Hope in Jesus Ministry in Providence: $100,000
Multi-Center for All in Providence: $100,000
OpenDoors in Providence: $167,207
WARM in Westerly: $264,905

Additionally, the following were awarded funds to manage warming centers:

Crossroads RI in Providence: $99,801
Rhode Island Council of Churches: $200,000
MAE Organization in Cranston: $77,500.00
The Town of West Warwick: $94,546 
Youth Pride in Providence: $120,707

The Most Rev. Israel Mercedes of the Multi-Center for All confirmed plans to shelter 12 veterans at its Broad Street center in Providence upon renovating the building’s second floor.
The seasonal new beds will operate in addition to Rhode Island’s 1,327 year-round beds funded through a $20 million commitment made by the governor and the Executive Office of Housing in August. That gives the state a little more than 1,600 available shelter beds for Rhode Island’s unhoused population through early spring.
McKee’s administration faced criticism during a polar vortex earlier this year from homeless advocates who urged him to declare a state of emergency to open additional shelter space amid a shortage of emergency beds. But the latest grants show a “continued commitment” to helping Rhode Islanders access emergency shelters as a short-term solution to more stable, long-term housing, McKee’s office said.
“My administration’s priority is keeping our most vulnerable residents safe, especially in the coldest months,” McKee said.
Youth Pride, which provides support for LGBTQ+ youth, initially applied for a $120,707 shelter grant but was unable to meet the requirements for the funding. 
“We don’t have capacity for people to sleep,” Logan England, the organization’s director of resources and programming, said in a phone interview. 
Instead, Youth Pride will use its funding to manage a warming center at its Westminster Street headquarters in Providence where people ages 18 to 24 can grab a meal, charge their phones, and connect with a case manager who can help refer them to a shelter or other assistance.
England said the plan is to get the center up and running by Dec.1.
“We would have liked to have opened sooner, but having just gotten approved last week we couldn’t even start to order food supplies until the grant was awarded,” he said.
At OpenDoors, Horton said the grant will also allow the nonprofit to hire additional house monitors to ensure help is available around the clock. 
“They help man the door, help guests follow rules, make sure there are no people on the property who shouldn’t be there,” he said. “They’re also a friendly shoulder — they do a little bit of everything.”
When OpenDoors’ seasonal beds are ready, Horton said he expects them to fill up quickly.
“Just to be clear, people should not be calling us before Dec. 1,” he said. 
Those seeking shelter must now go through the state’s new regional access points, walk-in centers across Rhode Island set up to connect people with housing and other services.
The referral system established Oct. 1 takes over shelter placements previously made through a singular hotline via the state’s Coordinated Entry System (CES) managed by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness.
The state’s shelter dashboard notes a total of 1,434 beds available across Rhode Island, with 76 unused as of Monday.

Lawmakers this week heard a range of possible fixes aimed at expanding access and lowering recidivism rates.
Inmates housed at facilities operated by the Virginia Department of Corrections are permitted by state law to participate in educational and vocational programs, including a “functional literacy” program for inmates testing below the 12th-grade level, adult basic education, career and technical education, and postsecondary education. However, not all prisons are required to offer inmate education.
As of February, 5,671 inmates were on waiting lists for educational programs, highlighting the demand that far surpasses DOC’s capacity, according to a report presented by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission at the direction of state lawmakers. About 40% of inmates require education to successfully reintegrate into society.
“We take this very seriously at the Department of Corrections,” said Chadwick Dotson, the agency’s director. “And again, the reason we do this is because every recidivism point we can drop, that’s one fewer victim, that’s one more father, mother raising their child. So it’s a win-win for everyone.”
Researchers found that inmates who participated in educational programs had better employment outcomes and quality of life after release than those who did not. But the demand continues to exceed the department’s capacity.
In addition to limited capacity, challenges include security staffing shortages — with vacancy rates over 20% at 16 of the 37 facilities — technology and infrastructure, and the inconsistent programming when inmates transfer between facilities.
Recommendations included better management of waitlists, improvements to GED testing processes (which dropped by 35% between 2022 and 2025), and stronger links between CTE programs and job opportunities. The discussion also emphasized the need for more funding and infrastructure upgrades to support education in prisons and jails.
Virginia currently allocates $36.8 million to adult basic education, CTE, and postsecondary education programs, which make up 2% of DOC’s $1.56 billion total budget.
Dotson told lawmakers that the agency is working to balance GED testing frequency, develop stronger employment connections, and improve technology and inmate transfers.
He said DOC is introducing new tablets to enable distance learning, expanding broadband access in facilities, and exploring an offender management system used in other states to better track and minimize disruptive transfers during coursework.
Terri Erwin, director of the Virginia Consensus for Higher Education in Prison — an initiative of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy — said one priority is expanding access to higher education for inmates following recent changes in Pell Grant eligibility. She said about67% of people incarcerated in Virginia are academically eligible for college.
“We’d like to see a return of college programs to the prisons because they have such a dramatically beneficial effect on reducing recidivism, but also increasing employability and wages and benefits for folks who ultimately return back to society,” Erwin said.
Lawmakers could introduce related legislation when they return to Richmond on Jan. 14 for the start of the General Assembly session. The study did not include juvenile detention centers.
Meanwhile, several agencies are developing a strategic plan to expand educational opportunities for incarcerated individuals. The effort stems from House Bill 2158, carried by Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, which aimed to strengthen carceral education from basic literacy through post-secondary programs but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
“We’re really excited about it, to be able to sit around the table and kind of noodle and do the math over how we fix some of the things that were referred to today, but in fact, it really requires some very pragmatic sitting around the table and figuring stuff out,” Erwin said.
Erwin said participating agencies include the State Council of Higher Education, the Department of Corrections, Virginia’s Community College System, and her own organization.
The plan could take between 10-12 months to complete.
Still, she said it was a good time for lawmakers to act. 
“We feel like it’s actually a very ripe time for legislators, there’s a lot of really good will towards expansion of educational opportunity, post secondary and generally, to build that pipeline …with the ABE and the GED, because that’s the ecosystem inside the prison,” Erwin. 
“It’s a throughput system, hopefully ending in higher education, which has the maximum increase in affecting recidivism, but also in terms of salaries, employability, but also salaries.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)After weeks of whiplash and food insecurity for about 850,000 Virginians during the nation’s longest federal government shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients appear on track to keep receiving a fraction of their benefits — at least for now.
The federal program, also known as SNAP, helps low-income families and people unable to work afford groceries. But it hasn’t been funded since the start of November, a casualty of the six-week-and-counting federal shutdown. 
The prospect of constituents going hungry spurred Gov. Glenn Youngkin to create a state-level temporary version of SNAP called the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, or VENA. After disbursing small allotments to Virginians last week by tapping into the state’s budget surplus, Youngkin announced over the weekend that VENA will be paused. 
Despite a court order directing President Donald Trump’s administration to utilize a contingency fund to distribute SNAP payments, the issue has been unresolved since early November. 
While the federal shutdown lingers, a partial breakthrough emerged Sunday evening. 
In a bipartisan move, seven Senate Democrats — including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — and one independent joined Republicans to advance legislation aimed at reopening the government and keeping funding flowing until late January.
The measure would also fully restore benefits for SNAP and other nutrition-program funding, though it must still pass the House before becoming law. 
Until Sunday’s vote, the Trump administration signaled it would partially tap into the contingency fund for SNAP, suggesting implementation could take weeks or months. Trump also wrote on social media that SNAP “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up the government.” 
That prompted  a federal district judge to reaffirm his order, ruling the partial payment plan noncompliant. At least 20 states began lining up to issue full payments to residents as Trump filed an appeal and urged states to “undo” efforts to provide full benefits. 
Before the weekend ended, Youngkin announced that Virginia would comply with the Trump administration and pause VENA this week. He said in a news release that he expects partial federal SNAP funding  to reach people’s benefit cards by Nov. 13. 
“Our top priority has been to ensure that every Virginian facing food insecurity knows that we are doing everything in our ability to provide food assistance,” Youngkin said. “Now, based on federal guidance, we are committed to processing the federal SNAP benefits made available no later than Thursday.” 
Because VENA had already distributed about 25% of typical monthly benefits, Youngkin said the state will deliver 65% of regular monthly federal funds to eligible Virginians this month. That means Virginians will have received about 90% of their usual allotment  by the end of November. 
For Richmond residents Daniel Garratt and Asia Broadie, the start of each month is typically grocery shopping time. 
Garratt, who lives in an apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities, said most of his Social Security income goes to rent, so SNAP has helped him keep food on the table. Broadie, a single mother juggling work with nursing school, said food “goes quick” with her growing children. She hopes to eventually earn enough not to need SNAP, but for now it gives her family peace of mind. 
While Youngkin is complying with the latest federal guidance, he is also promoting a donation page where Virginians can support their regional food banks through the Virginia Cares Initiative — which his administration has already seeded with $1 million.  
The move follows warnings from the Federation of Virginia Food Banks that its already  strained safety net can’t absorb the influx of SNAP recipients and furloughed federal workers without additional support.

Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, in May 2024. (Photo courtesy of Dan Helmer campaign)Days before the June 2024 Democratic primary for Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, allegations surfaced that Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, had sexually assaulted a woman. Helmer, who finished second in the crowded contest, later filed a defamation lawsuit claiming the allegations were false and politically motivated. 
By late October, the defendants — a group of people connected to a Northern Virginia Democratic committee — had settled the case out of court. 
In a statement, Helmer said that they couldn’t discuss the case in detail because the “terms are confidential,” but added that “the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the parties.”
The lawsuit had originally been filed against Avram Fechter, Charles King and Lissa Savaglio. Fechter and Savaglio have been involved with the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, while King has served as Savaglio’s attorney. Although Fechter and King have settled, Savaglio has not.  She was identified as the woman who allegedly accused Helmer of groping her during a 2018 event. 
In the suit that was filed in January, Helmer claimed that in May 2024, Savaglio contacted him to warn that a “grassroots activist” had asked her about rumours of sexual misconduct between the two. According to the filing, she offered no additional details at the time but allegedly said the rumors were false and called them “typical Republican tactics.” 
The suit also included screenshots of text messages purportedly between Helmer and Savaglio, as well as  an image showing her at a different event on the night of the alleged incident. 
When the story was first reported by NOTUS, a national outlet, last summer, Fechter said the incident prompted the Loudoun County Democratic Committee to adopt a new policy to prevent sexual misconduct. He also said no immediate action was taken after the alleged 2018 incident because the alleged victim was not yet willing to come forward publicly. 
It remains unclear what the terms of the settlement were, though Helmer had originally sought $15 million in damages. As Savaglio has not settled, it remains to be seen if the unresolved claims will proceed  in court — and what additional evidence either side may present.

(Getty Images)A defining New Hampshire renewable energy policy is once again facing proposed changes that opponents say would hamstring it and the state’s clean energy market.
Divided on the role of renewable energy in lowering electricity costs, the House Finance Committee voted, 14-11, Oct. 30 to recommend passage of the amended House Bill 219. The bill would alter the structure of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which sets goals for the amount of renewable energy fed to New Hampshire’s grid and directs money into the Renewable Energy Fund. That fund, in turn, is intended to bolster new renewable energy projects statewide. 
HB 219 proposes eliminating the portfolio’s specific provisions on solar energy while indefinitely fixing the compensation rates electricity providers must pay into the Renewable Energy Fund when they do not meet renewable quotas. 
Those in favor of the proposal say it will deliver needed rate cuts to consumers by reducing the amount that utilities spend to comply with the standard. Opponents argue the proposed changes would discourage renewable development in New Hampshire, taking the wind out of a policy that defines clean energy goals and has been the target of other cuts in recent years.
The discussion reflects a larger debate about the merits of the standard and the state’s role in encouraging renewable energy development.
“The role of the (Renewable Portfolio Standard) is foundational, but attacks on its efficacy are nothing new,” said Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs with Clean Energy New Hampshire, in an interview.
Understanding the program
A renewable portfolio standard is a system through which a state can track and set goals for the proportion of clean energy used across its grid. A majority of U.S. states have established such a system, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which in 2023 listed 36 states with renewable portfolio standards or similar programs.
Under New Hampshire’s standard, which was first enacted in 2007, electricity providers are given a percentage goal for the amount of renewably generated energy they sell. That breakdown has grown year over year, with electricity providers now expected to source 25.2 percent of electricity from renewable sources.
Within that 25.2 percent, renewable energy sources are further broken down by category, and the relative amount of energy that providers are required to source from each category also changes from year to year.
If a provider cannot, or does not, purchase enough from those sources to meet the quota of renewable energy set by the Renewable Portfolio Standard, they can also meet that quota in another way: by paying into the Renewable Energy Fund in what is known as an “alternative compliance payment.” 
Those payments and the interest on the fund make up the entirety of the Renewable Energy Fund, which is administered by the New Hampshire Department of Energy.
Proposed changes
As recommended for passage by the finance committee Oct. 30, the amended HB 219 calls for changes to the overall structure of the Renewable Portfolio Standard program. 
One of those changes would diminish the emphasis put on solar in the portfolio by folding the “solar” energy subcategory, which currently stands alone, into the broader “new renewables” subcategory.
The bill would also fix rates for the payments made by utility companies in lieu of purchasing renewable electricity. Currently, the rates change over time and in relation to the cost of renewable energy.
Proponents say this will lower the financial burden on utilities of complying with the Renewable Portfolio Standard, and in turn result in decreased rates for ratepayers.
“Basically, this bill is something that we’re doing to help the high cost of electricity in New Hampshire, to help our ratepayers,” said Rep. Jose Cambrils, a Loudon Republican, at the Finance Committee meeting Oct. 30.
Speakers stressed the high electricity rates paid by New Hampshire consumers. Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican, said he wanted to support the measure because it would reduce costs.
“If other forms of energy were cheaper, I would be more than happy to support them,” he said.
However, others said the changes would carry on a continual weakening of a central part of New Hampshire’s renewable policy.
“If we pass this bill … it will significantly weaken one of the last remaining programs we have to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy that will make us less dependent on the very volatile natural gas market,” said Rep. Chris Muns, a Hampton Democrat.
Paul said the bill as proposed would prevent the fund from bouncing back from the hit it took in the new budget, and have wider effects on the clean energy economy. In the biennial budget passed in June, lawmakers gutted the fund through 2027, sending all but $1 million annually to the General Fund.
“This bill will kill New Hampshire jobs in the long term, it will raise monthly bills for customers, and it … bakes in an incentive to avoid investing in New Hampshire,” he said. 
He criticized the fixed rates for alternative compliance payments. Over time, with no inflation indexing, he expects the payments to become cheaper than paying for renewably generated electricity — a difference that could encourage providers to simply pay the fee, rather than pay for actual clean energy. And he also disagreed that lowering penalties would translate naturally into lower rates for customers.
“Cutting the cap on a penalty is not the same as cutting the cost of electricity,” he said.
Folding in solar
The elimination of a standalone solar subcategory was another concern for Paul, who said it would muddy the solar energy market in the short term and have negative effects on renewable energy broadly in the long term.
This is due, in part, to how the electricity from distributed solar generation (meaning, for example, solar panels at a customer’s home) is tallied. 
Most larger renewable generators in New Hampshire, and many residential generators, register with the Department of Energy to certify the energy they produce. A registered facility can sell a “renewable energy certificate” for a set amount of electricity they have generated. These certificates, then, are the commodity that electric providers purchase to certify that they have paid for a given amount of renewably generated electricity, and in doing so, certify that they have complied with the Renewable Portfolio Standard.
But not all generators become certified, so not all eligible renewable generators sell renewable energy certificates. This includes many homeowners with solar panels. To account for those homes, the Department of Energy allows electricity providers to count a proportion of the unregistered but net metered generation on their network as a credit toward their annual solar total without purchasing renewable energy certificates from generators.
Folding solar in with other categories would add those previously unaccounted, free “swept” certificates into the market, artificially lowering the price paid for clean energy in New Hampshire, said Clean Energy New Hampshire Executive Director Sam Evans-Brown in an email.
Paul said this might lower the costs of alternative compliance payments in the short-term, but disagreed that this would lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of electricity for ratepayers, as proponents of the bill argue.
Renewable Energy Fund access has narrowed with time
As the ultimate landing place for compliance payments, the Renewable Energy Fund is where financial consequences to changes in the Renewable Portfolio Standard show up first. The fund has supported projects across the state for years, although observers have previously criticized the Department of Energy for, they said, chronically underspending Renewable Energy Fund dollars and accumulating the large surplus that was later targeted in the budget.
Over the course of fiscal year 2025, Renewable Energy Fund dollars were awarded through several programs, including about $1 million across four solar projects that will lower rates for low- and moderate-income communities, $185,006 for residential clean energy rebates, and $486,078 for commercial/industrial renewable energy projects, according to a Nov. 1 report released by the New Hampshire Department of Energy. About $876,000 from the fund is reported as spent on administrative costs during fiscal year 2025. In all, $3,547,368 in Renewable Energy Fund dollars was expended from the fund during that period, while the fund recorded revenues including $4,428,851 in compliance payments and just short of $1 million in interest, according to the report.
Fewer channels to access Renewable Energy Fund dollars are available to residents today than in years past. The residential solar rebate program was eliminated in 2024, leaving only the wood pellet furnace and boiler rebate program available to residential customers.
A grant program also administered through the Renewable Energy Fund, though technically still offered, was also quiet in its most recent cycle. The department issued a “request for proposals” for non-residential grants in October 2024, and received 11 responses requesting a total of $1,600,000, according to the report. However, the department later rescinded the request and did not award funding to any of the projects that had applied.
Chris Ellms, department deputy commissioner, said in an email Nov. 6 that none of the applicants’ projects had scored high enough to “justify moving forward.”
The prior funding year, the Department of Energy funded four projects, disbursing a total of $1,600,000, according to the report. Since 2011, the competitive grant program has funded a total of 56 nonresidential renewable energy projects in the state, disbursing a total of $16,380,154. The first year in which no project was funded was 2024; over the preceding 13 years, the department funded an average of 4.3 projects each year, disbursing an average of $1,260,212 per year.
Another $250,000 from the Renewable Energy Fund was transferred to the Department of Environmental Services, according to the report. The transfer was directed by the state budget, Ellms said.
The shrinking Renewable Energy Fund means less incentive for developers to site renewable projects in New Hampshire, according to Paul, setting New Hampshire up to continue relying on expensive outside sources — like imported natural gas — for electric generation.

(Getty Images.)Ohio House lawmakers approved several property tax reforms in recent weeks, and now state senators are debating those proposals.
One of the measures is already on its way to the Senate floor. Another four are still working their way through committees.
Following last Wednesday’s session, Senate President Rob McColley promised action and laid out a brisk timeline.
“We will be passing those, in all likelihood here this month, before we’re done this month,” he said.
“Which ones rise to the top, which one’s pass, and in what form, we’ll see. But I think there’s a desire among the caucus to try and see that stuff get across the finish line.”
Flipping the script
State senators advanced a measure out of committee last week which gives county auditors greater control over the home valuation process.
County auditors reappraise homes on a six-year cycle.
But midway through, they adjust those values based on a statistical sample, known as the triennial update.
Under current law, state tax officials review the auditor’s work, and if they disagree, they can order an auditor to adjust valuations.
The auditor can appeal that decision, but they carry the burden of proof.

Ohio House Bill 124, known colloquially as the “flip the script” bill, puts the onus on tax officials.
Instead of an auditor appealing, they’re given the benefit of the doubt, and tax officials can appeal if they believe the auditor got it wrong.
Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway said that’s as it should be.
“County auditors are in the best position to determine which sales are valid within their counties,” he said.
There are several instances where local knowledge matters.
A home sale between John Smith and Jane Doe looks normal on paper, Galloway said, but the auditor might know they’re siblings.
Since it’s not an arm’s length sale it shouldn’t be included.
Other sales could be outliers, due to renovation for instance, and they’d skew the formula for other homes.
The measure “allows for these kinds of inaccuracies to be corrected,” Galloway said. “This creates a fairer and more accurate valuation process for all taxpayers.”
No one testified against the proposal, and it passed out of committee unanimously.
What counts?
Ohio House Bill 129 would count more levies toward what’s known as the 20-mill floor.
Property taxes are collected in mills — like a percentage but calculated out of 1,000 instead of 100.
Twenty mills is the equivalent of 2%.
Since the 1970s, Ohio law has reduced homeowners’ tax rates to keep a levy’s revenue steady.
It means taxing authorities get only what voters approved even if home values climb.
But there’s an important caveat: School funding can’t dip below 20 mills, so if home values rise high enough there’s no more room for reductions.
Meanwhile, certain taxes like emergency and substitute levies are set aside from that 20-mill calculation.
By including them, the legislation creates slack, allowing tax rates to come down further.
School officials didn’t even push back on the idea.
“We are not here to disagree with whether these levies should be counted toward the floor,” Paul Imhoff from the Buckeye Association of School Administrators explained.
Instead, they want lawmakers to allow districts to renew those levies at the ballot rather than starting over with new ones.
That’s because back in 2014, lawmakers stopped paying a 12.5% state share for any new levies.
“In effect, homeowners would face a tax increase for the same amount of school revenue,” Imhoff said. “Put simply, House Bill 129 would have homeowners pay more for the same.”
That state share, known as the ‘rollback,’ accounts for roughly $96 million in school revenue across the state.
And in some districts, Imhoff said, the levies that stand lose state funding account for as much as a third of operating revenue.
Committee chair, state Sen. Sandra O’Brien, R-Ashtabula, seemed unmoved.
She said the state stepped in to help, “really out of their goodness,” but the total cost of the rollback isn’t that significant.
“Over all of the taxpayers, it’s going to be so minute no one’s going to even notice it,” she said. “So, I think maybe that could be a little bit disingenuous when you keep calling that a tax increase or losing tax dollars.”
Who really set rates?
The Ohio Constitution gives local governments the right to levy 10 mills of property tax, but every levy beyond that amount requires voter approval.
Ohio House Bill 309 would give county budget commissions, made up of the local auditor, treasurer and prosecutor, the authority trim those voted levies after the fact if they’re deemed unnecessary or excessive.
Policy Matters Ohio Research Director Zach Schiller said that’s “fundamentally undemocratic.”
The bill’s backers point to school districts on the 20-mill floor.
Because their tax rates haven’t been able to drop, their tax bills have risen with home values.
Supporters argue that subverts the will of the voters by increasing taxes without their approval.
“Yet here is a bill that would allow voter decisions to be overridden,” Schiller said.
After some last-minute tweaks in the House, the measure includes explicit definitions for “unnecessary” and “excessive” collections, as well as a five-year safe harbor for new levies.
But there is no safe harbor, Schiller noted, for renewal levies.
That means even if lawmakers maintain the rollback, county budget commissions could immediately reduce a levy renewed at the ballot.
Pounding his fist on the lectern, Schiller said he’d heard complaints about ‘unvoted’ levies “dozens and dozens and dozens of times.”
“So, if we’re going to respect the voters,” he said, “if we’re going to say that voters have to have the power, why are we going to pass a bill that expressly takes that power away from the voters?”
Even the typically tax-allergic Buckeye Institute gestured toward additional guardrails as it expressed its support.
Research fellow Greg Lawson warned lawmakers may need to ensure, “levies remain high enough to satisfy their original purposes and over-zealous commissioners do not substitute their personal tax-cutting preferences for the will of the voters.”
Lawson noted possibilities like specific metrics for “excess” and limits on the time period or amount of tax cuts.
That said, he continued, “the need for those manageable safeguards should not preclude the bill’s enactment.”

Setting the ceiling
Ohio’s constitutionally permitted 10 mills of property tax is known as ‘inside’ millage, while any other levies approved by voters are known as ‘outside’ millage.
A pair of bills would cap the increase of both kinds of millage at the rate of inflation in the broader economy.
The measure related to outside millage, Ohio House Bill 186, would affect the roughly two-thirds of school districts at the 20-mill floor.
Ohio’s longstanding program that lowers rates to hold taxes steady would control taxes in the remaining districts.
Auditor Galloway from Lake County said providing an inflationary cap “eliminates the single largest unvoted tax increase in Ohio history.”
And Elizabeth Baumgartner from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce warned rising property taxes discourages businesses interested in moving to Ohio and those that want to expand.
She explained a chamber-backed study found Ohio’s property taxes were 72% higher than in six peer states.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, agreed that Ohio’s property taxes are high, but dug a bit deeper.
He described a study his office conducted of income, sales and property taxes in ten nearby states.
Ohio came in near the top for property and sales taxes, but dead last in income tax for high earners.
“We’ve continued to whittle down one of those three legs of the stool to the point where now we’ve created an imbalance,” he said.
“Whereas if you look at Pennsylvania and Michigan, states next to us, very similar to us in terms of economy, population, etc., all three of their categories are in the bottom half.”
Because Ohio’s rate reduction program doesn’t apply to inside millage, those taxes have always grown with property values.
Galloway stressed that by capping inside millage at inflation, as well, lawmakers would affect property taxes statewide.
“House Bill 335 provides relief for all,” he said, noting the overall savings for homeowners amounts to roughly $700 million.
Galloway’s only suggestion was for lawmakers to include an emergency clause so the bill takes effect before auditors begin their next round of valuations.
Smith asked if time is short, why not delay implementation until the next tax year so auditors have time to prepare?
“Yes,” Galloway said, “it would potentially be easier on our offices to have an entire year to put all this together and manage it — a certain comfort level. But I would suggest that our taxpayers don’t have that comfort level.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In their competition for rural health care dollars from a new federal fund, states are seeking money to bolster emergency services, address chronic diseases, and recruit and train more doctors and nurses.
All 50 states submitted their applications to the federal government last week to get shares of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program.
Congress created the program in response to concern from rural health care providers — as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — about the effects of Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed this summer.
A Stateline analysis of 10 states’ applications to the Rural Health Transformation Program found common focus areas, including expanding mobile health care access and bolstering emergency medical services. States also focused on chronic disease prevention programs, technological advancements and rural clinician recruitment.
Racial health disparities could widen as states grapple with Trump cuts, experts warn

Stateline examined proposals from states that had large rural populations or had released their proposals. Missouri, North Carolina and Oklahoma are among a dozen states that have expanded Medicaid and would be hardest hit by rural Medicaid cuts — each seeing at least $4.5 billion in reductions over 10 years. The other states whose proposals were examined are: Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Washington state and West Virginia.
Rural health care leaders told Stateline that states had to rush to develop the pitches. After the official funding notice was announced by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), states had about seven weeks to put together their applications. Many held listening sessions with hospitals, clinics and community members, and opened public comment periods to help inform priorities. Others created advisory or working groups.
State officials and medical groups said the federal infusion of money is welcome, but isn’t enough to offset billions in Medicaid losses, and won’t be a magic bullet to solve a structural problem: a health care payment system that favors patient volume and doesn’t work for sparsely populated rural America. The new law cuts $911 billion from Medicaid over the next decade — with rural communities slated to lose about $137 billion, according to health policy research group KFF. The new rural health program could offset just over a third of cuts in rural areas, KFF estimates.
“It’s going to be a Band-Aid,” Toniann Richard, CEO of HCC Network, which runs six Missouri rural community health clinics, said about the grants. “How do we make sure that it’s not just a one-time Band-Aid — that it’s maybe a waterproof Band-Aid?”
More than 700 hospitals — roughly a third of rural U.S. hospitals — are at risk of closing because of financial problems, while rural labor and delivery units struggle to stay open and residents grapple with higher rates of chronic illness but live far from care.
Half of the Rural Health Transformation Program — $25 billion — will be distributed equally to states with approved applications, regardless of each state’s proportion of rural hospitals or population. The remaining half will be allocated by CMS based on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. CMS said it will decide on applications by the end of the year.
From mental health to tech innovation
CMS outlined priorities for the program, with each state developing its own approach to fulfilling them. Those include technological improvements, an expanded and sustainable workforce, new ways of coordinating care and chronic disease prevention. Rural residents are more likely to die early from conditions such as heart disease. Some states proposed new screening or telehealth initiatives for those conditions.
Helping rural areas keep clinicians also was a focus across the grant proposals. Several states said they would use funds to expand rural residencies and apprenticeships for medical school graduates to try to draw more providers to their areas.
Every rural and low-population Colorado county contains areas considered EMS deserts, the state said, proposing $45 million to $55 million over the next five years to expand rural EMS.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Colorado and other states proposed increasing remote patient monitoring for rural patients living far from care. That’s a form of telehealth that helps doctors track patients’ health while they’re at home, such as through devices to monitor weight, blood pressure or blood sugar levels that send results digitally to clinicians. Doctors can then monitor for unmanaged blood sugar or sudden weight gain and discuss a plan with patients without “forcing folks to have to drive into the clinic,” said Michelle Mills, CEO of the Colorado Rural Health Center, the state’s nonprofit rural health office.
Overdose and suicide rates are often higher in rural communities; behavioral and mental health were addressed in several state applications.
West Virginia has the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths. The state released a grant proposal summary that has little information on mental health and drug use initiatives, but says addiction treatment would be “enhanced” to support a “drug-free workforce.”
North Carolina said it would grow community mental health clinics and integrate behavioral health within “regional care networks.” Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and Washington also proposed initiatives focused on rural behavioral health care access or suicide prevention.
New Mexico proposed establishing a grant program that would allow rural communities to apply for and create pilot projects tailored to their own specific needs, and a program for specialists to consult with each other across the state. The state also proposed $363 million toward specialty care and chronic disease management for high-risk rural groups, including planning regionalized “specialty and maternal care networks.”
West Virginia said it would create a new rural transportation system that would fund rideshare and other transportation services, as well as coordinate with EMS and hospitals to more efficiently transport rural patients to care.
States are also taking varied approaches on how they would split the funds or connect care among regions. For example, Missouri and North Carolina would divide states into regional rural “hubs,” to target different communities’ needs. Missouri would integrate rural clinics, pharmacies and public health agencies by coordinating care for patients and sharing data.
Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association, advised the state on its application. One advantage of that regional model, she said, is that it allows low-income community health centers — also called federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) — to take the lead in specific regions that don’t have hospitals.










We've been screaming for decades about the need for money just like this to come in — but it's under the cloud of all of the other cuts that are coming, potentially with Medicaid.


– Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association


“In the southeast corner of the state, we’ve had multiple hospital closures, and so there, the FQHC is the only provider,” Lucas said.
“We’ve been screaming for decades about the need for money just like this to come in — but it’s under the cloud of all of the other cuts that are coming, potentially with Medicaid. … Knowing that that freight train is coming at us over the next decade,” she continued.
Oklahoma hasn’t provided details about its application. But Rich Rasmussen, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said his team likewise proposed the state create a network of regional rural hospital hubs, through which hospitals could apply for resources. Each hub would have funding pools that could help pay for a range of services, from help for indigent patients to data services and workforce support.
North Dakota’s application said nearly 75% of its rural counties lack enough primary care clinicians. The state proposed retention and recruitment grants meant to incentivize practitioners to stay in rural areas, expanding rural housing and rotations for clinicians in training, and offering on-site child care at rural health facilities. It also aims to target maternal health care deserts by training EMS workers to better respond to rural maternal health emergencies.
New Mexico, North Dakota and Washington proposed specific initiatives to support rural tribal communities. For example, North Dakota wants to revamp electronic health records systems in tribal communities, as many rural, underfunded tribal health facilities use outdated systems that make it harder to transfer and access patient records.
Democratic state Rep. Jayme Davis is a member of the state’s Rural Health Transformation Committee, a group of lawmakers that recommended draft state legislation based on the grant application. She said she helped advocate for tribal communities’ needs. Native people make up about 5% of North Dakota’s population.
“I have an elderly parent and aunts and uncles, and going to Fargo is a strain on them,” she said of her family, who live in Rolette, 3 1/2 hours from Fargo.
Maryland’s plan is divided into three initiatives: recruiting and training new rural health providers and students; creating more sustainable ways for patients to access care, such as mobile health care units dedicated to each rural region; and nutrition and food programs that connect local farm harvests with rural hunger “hot spots.”
Hospitals’ concerns
Health care officials in several states said they worry that the new program will not be enough to offset looming Medicaid cuts.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

In Oklahoma, about 63% of rural hospitals are at risk of closure, and more than a quarter are at immediate risk. Ahead of the grant application, the state’s hospital association provided financial vulnerability assessments of the hospitals to help inform the state’s application priorities.
Rasmussen, of the Oklahoma hospital association, said one of his biggest concerns is the new law’s decrease of state-directed payment programs have helped struggling hospitals offset low reimbursement rates.
“It’s the rural hospitals that took the cuts by Congress,” he said, noting that over the next decade, Oklahoma would lose $6.7 billion due to Medicaid cuts. “Whatever our state receives is not going to come anywhere close to offsetting those costs.”
The rural grant program restricts how awarded funds can be spent. Dollars allocated to states must be used for specific purposes, meaning states cannot dole out direct funds to rural hospitals or rural clinics. For example, funds can’t be used for new construction and services already reimbursable by programs such as Medicaid.
CMS has also put limits on how much can be used for each approved purpose. There is a 15% cap on how much of the award can go directly to providers.
“That cap is fairly low from a lot of folks’ perspective,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer of the National Rural Health Association, which represents rural health care providers. “It is in no way direct payments to rural hospitals or rural clinics, and it’s not even necessarily a guarantee in every state that those entities will be receiving funding, although I would hope so, given the general intent of the program.”
Weatherford Regional Hospital in western Oklahoma is the only critical access hospital still delivering babies in the state, according to the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
“For our hospital, we barely make a profit,” said Darin Farrell, president and CEO of the hospital, who added that he worries his facility won’t be able to maintain obstetrics after Medicaid cuts down the line. “If they don’t put something else to fill the gap of those cuts that are coming, then we’re all going to have to decide what services are the most vital.”
In West Virginia, more than half of the population lives in a rural area and about a dozen rural hospitals are at risk of closure, according to a report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Jim Kaufman, president and CEO of the West Virginia Hospital Association, which met with Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office to provide feedback ahead of the application deadline, said the fund will not be enough to offset Medicaid cuts.
“We’re estimating we’re going to lose more than a billion dollars once all the cuts are fully implemented, just from the hospitals in West Virginia,” he said. “So while this rural health application does provide some opportunity to look at transforming rural health care, it will not replace the dollars that the hospitals are losing alone.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Both the whistleblower and the startup investment firm she accused of corruption testified last week during the civil trial regarding the alleged scandal inside the retired teachers’ pension fund board.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps is set to decide whether or not she should remove State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum from his position, and if he and former board member Wade Steen should be banned from ever returning to public pensions.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This case began with a whistleblower letter sent to government officials in May of 2024. That month, the governor received a 14-page memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could benefit them.
Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that they should be punished because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
STRS Chief Legal Counsel Stacey Wideman testified on the stand, confirming that she and another colleague wrote the whistleblower letter.
Wideman, who has worked at the pension fund for more than a decade, started drafting her concerns years ago, she said.
“Our intention over the course of this, starting in 2021, was to document these unusual kinds of unprecedented things that were occurring at STRS that caused us to believe that the teachers’ money could be at risk,” Wideman said.
Metcalf took the stand, explaining how he got involved with QED after believing that STRS was not being honest with the investment reports and subsequently, bonuses to staff.
“I was concerned that STRS investment mismanagement had resulted in a decrease in benefits to Ohio teachers,” Metcalf said.
The state said that Metcalf worked behind the scenes to try to secure a $65 billion deal.
Wideman pointed out concerns that Steen and Fichtenbaum were too close to Metcalf.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
“I am writing content as though I am Mr. Steen,” Metcalf said during cross-examination.
The defense said getting advice isn’t a crime, but the state asked if getting advice meant sharing confidential documents with Metcalf.
“Staff often stamp things confidential that I did not believe was confidential,” Steen said.
When asked by the judge if he ever confirmed it wasn’t confidential, Steen said no.
But with Steen already off the board, his team argues that this case is meaningless. But for Wideman, it isn’t.
Fichtenbaum told us in mid-2024 that he would be open to still considering a deal with QED.
“I don’t think we were really, ever even given a fair shot at trying to articulate and explain why we thought this was something that was worthwhile looking into,” Fichtenbaum said about QED in 2024.
Asked if he was still considering QED, he responded, “I don’t know at this point.”
“I think that the idea that they had about earning fees is not a bad idea.”
He was asked again if he would choose QED.
“I think that — would it be worth having somebody vetting that idea and looking at it?” he responded, shrugging.
“I think we should always be looking for ways to try and make money with and take less risk for the pension.”
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September 2024 revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Wideman said her intent in sending the letter was to ask for help investigating why QED was “still lingering at STRS years after failing due diligence.”
Each side is drafting its written closing arguments, and the judge will rule in the next couple of months.

(Photo by Lord Henri Voton/E+ via Getty Images)My friend with whom I serve on a nonprofit board works for the military as a social worker. She said that the military has gone through a difficult time during the government shutdown. She truly cares about those who serve our country and their precious families. She is their advocate.
The shutdown affected millions of Americans and many, many Kansans. The pain of loss is great, and the trauma is great. As I drive down the road each day, the anger and grief in people’s eyes is apparent. There has already been so much loss and tumult and change and trauma. With everything going on in our nation, it’s difficult to find hope.
Just look at the federal workers. They may have a job today but maybe not tomorrow. It’s all very sad to me.
Alan Wolfelt is a grief counselor in Colorado who has written numerous books on change and loss. Valeo Behavioral Health Care offered an educational class about one of his books on grief taught by Shelley Endsley. About 10 people came together to learn and to heal from trauma. We discussed the pain of losing a parent, a partner, job loss, relationship loss — you name it, we discussed it. Shelley did a fabulous job facilitating the group. We even had snacks, with fruit and bagels. It was a gift.
How do we heal the soul of America, and how do we heal the spirit of Kansas?
How do we learn how to be kind to one another during such grief-ridden times? I would say find solace in the little things — buying someone’s McDonald’s breakfast, taking groceries to a senior neighbor who can’t leave home. It doesn’t take much. We need to get creative and reach out. As the golden rule states, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” The task is clear: Dare to be kind in a hateful world.
I grew up in the 1980s, and one of the great eighties movies was The NeverEnding Story. It’s about a boy who loses his mom and is bullied at school. He reads a book that opens him up to his imagination. He learns to find hope and healing from the pain of being bullied and the loss of his mom. Perhaps that is an idea for us. We can open a beloved book, where we can lose ourselves and take heart. Books can help heal our hurts. Books can shine light in a dark world.
We can also find inspiration through music. I love the song, “Viva la Vida” by Coldplay. Chris Martin sings about how he used to be powerful in the world but now he has been humbled. I can relate. I feel like I used to be on top of my game, and now I am just hanging in there. That song gives me comfort.
Here’s the point: There is hope in times like these. It may seem like the end is near. However, through kindness to others, reaching out, reading inspiring books, listening to inspiring music and so much more, we can help heal our wounds of loss and trauma.
I’m not trying to be emotional, but we all have felt a little hurt these days. Let’s not give up. Let’s hold each other up and move forward one step at a time.

(Photo from NASA Glenn Research Center website.)As a physics professor at Ohio State University, I’ve written a few op-eds this year to explain how decision making in Washington has thrown a serious wrench into the career plans of a generation of young scientists both nationally and in Ohio. 
I’ve worked with reporters to highlight the cancellation threat to nearly complete projects like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which professors and students in Ohio State’s Department of Astronomy have been working on for over a decade.
Now I am speaking out because the federal government has been shut down since a funding lapse began on October 1. 
As a scientist it is not my mission to explain why we’ve reached this point or what it will take to climb out of it. 
But I can explain that when the government shuts down, many federal employees have to stay home, and this includes scientists at government labs and staff members at science funding agencies who help keep America’s science and technology machine going.
Ohio is a scientific powerhouse.

We have an Air Force R&D presence larger than any other state that is housed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. 
Further north we have the NASA Glenn research center, which is where every new NASA satellite is sent for testing. 
In Columbus, Ohio State University received nearly $800 million in federal research grants last year, and the Battelle Institute is no less connected to federal funding sources and research.
The shutdown has had an immediate impact on regularly scheduled meetings between government scientists and university researchers. 
In my research group, meetings with research scientists at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss experiments funded by the Air Force Office of Science Research haven’t happened since September. 
Another OSU physics professor’s collaboration with the Air Force to develop secure quantum communications has been interrupted. 
In many cases, the projects being impacted and the government workers being furloughed don’t depend on the current budget negotiations in congress.
My colleagues in the biological sciences are perhaps even more profoundly affected. 
In Ohio alone, the National Institute of Health (NIH) funds over a billion dollars of medical and biological research projects each year. 
With NIH staffers furloughed, this creates problems for researchers trying to run existing projects. 
And the funding of new NIH projects is delayed because long-planned “scientific merit reviews” are indefinitely postponed. 
It is hard to find the right metaphor for this disruption, but imagine if OSU announced that its annual Pelotonia fund raiser might be cancelled next year. 
This would jeopardize something like $26 million dollars of continued funding to advance projects towards improving cancer care. 
Now imagine if, instead of $26 million dollars, like the Pelotonia raised last year, it typically brought in 25 times as much, and imagine this uncertainty affecting every major medical research center in the country. 
This begins to communicate the mess that the impasse in Congress is producing.
Scientists are not interested in debating who’s suffering the most from the shutdown. 
If the Trump administration uses the shutdown to justify further “reductions in force” at scientific agencies, or if funding interruptions prompt universities to close research labs, and scale back Ph.D. programs, what is there to gain by comparing this chaos to anything?
 Careers to advance the scientific expertise of our country are being ruined.
I wish I could say that the threat to the enterprise of American science was theoretical in some way, but these times give me no such luxury.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Bumping all the way up against her deadline to decide what congressional boundaries will govern Utah’s 2026 elections, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson issued a key decision in the state’s court-ordered redistricting battle late Monday. 
In her ruling, Gibson overwhelmingly sided with the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Utah Legislature, blocking the Republican-controlled Legislature’s map C from being used in the 2026 elections while instead approving one of the plaintiffs’ submitted alternatives, known as Map 1. 
The Legislature’s map, she wrote, “fails in many ways to comply with Proposition 4,” a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria.

“In sum, the record overwhelmingly supports the Court’s conclusion that Map C exhibits substantial pro-Republican bias,” the judge wrote in the 89-page ruling. 
Her order came at about 11:40 p.m. Monday, minutes before midnight on the day the state’s top election officials said would be the latest possible date to set a congressional map in order to give county clerks enough time to prepare for candidate filings in January.
The judge’s selection gives Democratic candidates a good chance at one of Utah’s U.S. House seats in next year’s midterm elections, at a time when redistricting shuffles are playing out around the country and both major parties are pulling for the majority.
Utah House and Senate Democratic lawmakers issued a prepared statement after midnight reacting to the ruling with “a deep sense of hope and relief.”
“This is a win for every Utahn,” the statement said. “We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.”
Gibson, in a ruling earlier this summer, voided Utah’s last congressional map that the Utah Legislature set in 2021. In that decision, the judge ruled their map was the result of an unconstitutional process after lawmakers that year undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which established an independent redistricting commission and neutral map-drawing criteria meant to guard against gerrymandering. 
To replace the 2021 map in time for the 2026 elections, Gibson ordered a “remedial” court process, giving the Utah Legislature and the plaintiffs suing state officials the opportunity to submit map proposals for her to pick from. She also restored Proposition 4 as law. 
In a special session last month, the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature voted “under protest” to submit a map known as map C — one that Utah Republican Party leaders urged their members to support as the least damaging option. 
Democrats argued that map C was the worst choice — especially when paired with a bill, SB1011, that the Legislature also voted to approve to require the state’s next congressional maps (including the one picked by Gibson) to pass three statistical tests meant to bar the maps from favoring one party over another. 
Those tests (particularly one known as the partisan bias test) were problematic to use in a “lopsided” state like Utah, the plaintiffs argued, where active registered Republicans (916,236) outnumber Democrats (238,979) statewide by more than 677,000 voters. Republicans, however, argued in favor of codifying the three tests to clarify “vague” language in Proposition 4 and use their “discretion” to decide the “best available data and scientific methods” to use in evaluating maps, as Proposition 4 requires. 
That prompted the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — which include the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and a handful of Salt Lake County voters — to file another complaint in court. 
Redistricting plaintiffs: Judge has ‘no choice’ but to void Utah Legislature’s map, pick another

They urged Gibson to block SB1011, alleging it “cherry picks” flawed statistical tests for states like Utah while accusing Utah lawmakers of again passing a law that “impaired” Proposition 4, therefore violating their right to alter and reform their government through a ballot initiative. 
Gibson, in her ruling, agreed with plaintiffs’ arguments on SB1011 too — and preliminarily blocked it from taking effect. 
“Map C does not abide by Proposition 4’s traditional redistricting criteria ‘to the greatest extent practicable,’” Gibson wrote. “And, based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that Map C was drawn with the purpose to favor Republicans — a conclusion that follows from even S.B. 1011’s metric for partisan intent — and it unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.”
By granting the preliminary injunction, SB1011 “is not the governing law for this remedial proceeding,” Gibson ruled.
Leading up to Monday night’s ruling, Gibson listened to more than 15 hours of testimony and fielded over 1,000 pages of evidence submitted by attorneys for the Legislature and the plaintiffs, each side citing competing redistricting experts in their arguments over why the judge should pick their preferred maps. 
While alleging map C fell short of adhering to Proposition 4, the plaintiffs submitted two other map options for the judge to consider. 
The plaintiffs’ Map 1, they said, came from a set of 10,000 maps “generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4’s priority-ordered redistricting criteria without considering partisan data.” It splits only one city (Midvale) and “has a significant population overlap” with the Orange and Purple maps proposed by the Independent Redistricting Commission in 2018. 
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

The plaintiffs also described their proposed Map 2 as a “least change” map based on the Legislature’s adopted map C but with “changes made to correct its failures to conform to Proposition 4’s requirements,” splitting only one city (Pleasant Grove). 
From the other corner, legislative attorneys argued that lawmakers’ map C complied with Proposition 4’s ranked criteria, which prioritizes minimization of city and county splits first while also requiring prioritization of other redistricting principles like compactness, contiguity, respecting traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest, and following geographic features. 
Map C split three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) into 11 pieces and three counties (Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties) into seven pieces. The plaintiffs’ maps each split one city into two pieces (Map 1 split Midvale while Map 2 split Pleasant Grove) and three counties into six pieces (Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties, in both maps). 
Gibson, in her ruling Monday, sided with the plaintiffs’ arguments that the Legislature’s map did not comply with Proposition 4, was drawn with consideration of partisan political data, violated Proposition 4’s ban on partisan gerrymandering, and unduly favored the Republican Party over the Democratic Party. 
While Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have said they don’t think the judge would have the constitutional authority to pick another map other than Map C, Gibson wrote in her decision that state and federal courts have supported court-ordered redistricting processes when legislatures fail to enact legal maps.

“This Court approaches this task somewhat reluctantly,” Gibson wrote. “But this is the remedial process recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court and by other state courts, agreed to by the parties in this case, and ordered by the Court. Based on the evidence — and after an evidentiary hearing — the Court found that Map C does not comply with Proposition 4’s requirements.”
To ensure “Utahns cast ballots under a congressional map that is equally apportioned under both federal and state constitutional requirements and that otherwise complies with Utah’s law on redistricting in Proposition 4,” Gibson said she must now choose a congressional map by the Nov. 10 deadline.
“The Court’s ruling on which congressional map will be adopted is not based on any policy,” she wrote. “Rather, it will be based on the law.”
What now?
The judge’s ruling gives more clarity — for now — when it comes to what Utah’s 2026 congressional boundaries will look like next year. 
But there’s still plenty of uncertainty over the future of Utah’s redistricting process. 
In continued angst over Proposition 4 — arguing the narrowly-passed law jeopardizes Utah’s “constitutional order” by removing the power of map-drawing from legislators — Utah Republican Party leaders and the political issues committee called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to ask voters to repeal Proposition 4 during the 2026 elections. 
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

For that ballot initiative, the group has been holding a series of public hearings across the state, including seven Monday night. To qualify the repeal question for the 2026 ballot, the group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
Initially, the Utah Republican Party had also said it would pursue a referendum on map C — the same map it had urged Utahns to support — but last week Utah GOP Chair Rob Axson told reporters party leaders decided against pursuing signatures for that effort, saying they now plan to put all of their effort behind the initiative to repeal Proposition 4. 
“The only way to repeal a law that was passed through initiative, with Utah’s current understanding following court decisions, is through another initiative. The initiative has always been the primary focus of what we’re doing. Nothing has changed there,” Axson told ABC4.
Utah’s Republican leaders have also said they intend to continue to fight Gibson’s rulings in court by appealing the case to the Utah Supreme Court, and if necessary the U.S. Supreme Court. 
But because the lieutenant governor’s office, which oversees the state’s elections, has said Nov. 10 would be the drop-dead deadline to determine the 2026 congressional map, it’s likely the map Gibson picked will indeed be used for next year’s election. 
But for 2028? More court battles and legislative wrangling are likely to play out to determine the future of redistricting in Utah. 
Additionally, Gibson is likely to continue to catch the ire of Utah’s Republican legislative leaders. During the Oct. 6 special session when the Legislature implemented map C, some Republican legislators indicated they would entertain the idea of pursuing articles of impeachment against Gibson if she didn’t pick their preferred map.

On the Senate floor that day, Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, characterized Gibson’s court-ordered redistricting process as a “joke” and a “farce.” And Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, argued that the Utah Constitution says “the only way a map can be accepted is by approval by the Legislature.” 
“It is our duty as a Legislature to approve a map, otherwise there is no other means by which a map may be used, even if parties ask for it,” Brammer said. “It would be a malfeasance in office — a malfeasance in office — for a court to attempt to accept a map that has not been approved by the Legislature, or for a lieutenant governor to certify and use a map that has not been approved by the Legislature.” 
Under Utah law, elected officials and judges can only be impeached for “high crimes and misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.” Any impeachment proceedings would also be required to start in the House.
When pressed by reporters, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, would not say whether the House would be open to considering articles of impeachment against Gibson, saying, “I’m not going to get into what the House is going to do in a theoretical (situation).” However, he also said the Legislature will “do all we can to protect the power given to it in the Constitution.” 
“Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for a judge to be able to pick a map,” Schultz said at the time. “And we will adamantly defend that, to whatever means necessary.”

Ned Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002, he halted the most substantial statewide progress we have seen in years on housing. That bill was shaped in public. Residents testified. Local volunteers showed up. Advocates brought data and lived experience. Legislators listened. The public did everything democracy requires when asked.
The new bill coming before lawmakers this week was drafted privately by a limited set of insiders and released only on November 7 — giving advocates, experts, and residents fewer than seven days to review it before a special-session vote.
It was not drafted with the public, not with the hundreds who testified, not with the experts, planners, tenants, or developers who worked for months on HB 5002 — but only with the insiders in the room. The rest of Connecticut is being told to wait quietly while a final version is pushed to vote on Wednesday and Thursday. 
That is not transparency. That is not a partnership. That is not how a state in a housing crisis should make policy.
Here is who is being left out:
Renters in New London who have endured relentless rent hikes. Windham families who are dreaming of owning a home. Seniors in Montville, Lisbon, and Killingly who just want to stay near their families. Employers in Groton and Norwich who cannot fill jobs because workers cannot find housing nearby. The advocates who helped shape HB 5002. 
The experts, the builders, and the tenants were all left out.  So were the thousands of residents who initially testified and mobilized because their housing stability is at risk.
When legislation is created only by those already in positions of power, we get the same results that got us into this crisis. We end up wondering why bills pass but rents keep rising, zoning stays restrictive, and displacement accelerates. The answer is simple. Solutions that exclude the people living the problem will never be bold enough to solve it.
Here is the truth. A rushed, watered-down, privately negotiated bill is not progress. A bad secret bill is worse than no bill at all. It creates the illusion of action while allowing the crisis to deepen.
It is now planned that the revised bill could be brought to the floor for a vote as soon as November 12 or 13, with no meaningful opportunity for advocates, experts, practitioners, and residents to weigh in. The people who will live with the consequences are expected to accept them blindly. That is unacceptable.
Communities in Eastern Connecticut are doing their part. From Ledyard to Mansfield and New London to Hebron, towns have encouraged and approved new senior apartments, homeownership opportunities, and stable homes.  Planners and volunteers are putting in the work to make housing more attainable. They deserve a state policy framework shaped with transparency and partnership. And the residents who lie awake at night worried about next month’s rent deserve to know that their stories still matter. 
Housing is not theoretical here. It is the couple sleeping in their car in Waterford. It is the nurse commuting from Rhode Island.  It is the family who can barely afford the rent, let alone buy a home someday.  It is the veteran who cannot afford to live in the town where he raised his children.  It’s our neighbors being forced out by predatory private equity landlords.  
If leaders are confident in this bill, they should show it to the public now. Explain what changed. Explain who influenced those changes. Explain why those of us closest to residents were pushed out of the room.
This is a defining moment for Connecticut. We either insist on accountability and shared responsibility, or accept a system in which only those already in power decide who belongs, where decisions are made in the dark.
Residents need to speak up.  Demand a housing future written with, not for, the people who need it most.  
Open the doors. Restore trust. Connecticut’s families cannot afford closed-door decisions that look like momentum but leave them further behind.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"While CT stalls, immigrant families suffer",Rochelle Palache,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/while-ct-stalls-immigrant-families-suffer/,"We applaud lawmakers' efforts this year to strengthen protections for immigrants, but for this upcoming special session, Connecticut must do more.","During this time of unprecedented attack on our immigrant communities, it has never become more important for state and local governments to demonstrate their solidarity with residents through unabashed support and action. 
We’ve seen some  strong acts of solidarity: Chicago making it so that ICE agents can be arrested over unlawful actions, Boston’s Mayor Michelle Wu’s refusal to rescind Boston’s welcoming policies despite direct federal threats if she didn’t, and California’s recent signing into law a bill that protects schools and public hospitals from federal law enforcement officers, including ICE.
But while these efforts to protect immigrants blossom across the country, over here in Connecticut, one can’t help but wonder: why isn’t our leadership doing more?
One of the biggest efforts to stand with immigrant communities this past legislative session was led by a coalition seeking to modify Connecticut’s Trust Act, which outlines the extent to which local and state officials can work with the federal government to detain immigrants. After months of advocacy, rallies, petitions, and phone banking, a significant win was had: individuals can now sue over violations of the Trust Act, and there has been an expansion of which state officials are covered by the law. These are helpful and necessary additions – but to ensure the safety and security of our most vulnerable, they must go further.
I work directly with many immigrants as the leader of 32BJ SEIU in Connecticut, one of the largest majority immigrant unions in the country. Not only does our union recognize the hard work and values that immigrants bring to our country, but our membership also exemplifies those assets. Across the 12 states where our union operates, 32BJ members come from 64 countries and speak 28 different languages. Many came to the U.S. for economic opportunity, others seeking safety for themselves and their families.
Their stories reflect my own – when I immigrated from Jamaica to the U.S. in 1999 to pursue my degree at Smith College, I brought with me my dreams and hopes of a better future. It is now my honor to work with the most vulnerable in our society to build their power, so they can forge a future where their children can succeed.
However, for many of our members, these dreams have been abruptly placed on pause as seizures by ICE agents have increased in Connecticut. Immigrants of all statuses now live in fear of their loved ones being snatched off the streets, or of being taken themselves. Raids at everyday locations, like car washes in Hamden, Newington, and Southington, have had a chilling impact, with many immigrants now withdrawing behind locked doors, unsure of who to trust.
We’re aware that the federal administration’s aggressive targeting of immigrants hinders the willingness of all immigrant workers — no matter their status — to report any mistreatment at work they’re facing. According to the Economic Policy Institute, workers born outside of the United States are more likely to experience minimum wage violations than their native counterparts. How likely is it that workers are going to come forward knowing the federal administration is targeting them more aggressively?
While we applaud the legislature and governor’s efforts this year to strengthen protections for immigrants, for this upcoming special session, Connecticut must do more, including:

Protecting personal information held by state agencies from federal government
Prohibiting the use of state resources for immigration enforcement
Protecting and guaranteeing Medicaid coverage regardless of immigration status

These additional provisions aren’t excessive – they’re essential to safeguarding immigrants in Connecticut. This administration has shown no limits in its determination to prioritize detention and deportation over the right to  basic survival, as evidenced by the handing over of 79 million Medicaid recipients’ personal data to ICE, cutting or refusing to fully fund social services like SNAP while allocating billions to ICE, and drawing new restrictions around Medicaid that prevents many immigrants from having coverage. The more time that passes, the more time ICE has to further sow fear and anxiety in our communities.
We may no longer have the luxury of time, but we have the advantage of the upcoming special session. And it’s not just organizations like 32BJ, alongside our allies and partners, who are pushing for enhanced immigration protections. Unprecedented electoral wins across the country and here in Connecticut, including several flipped seats, demonstrate how people are voting for representatives that have the interests of working families and immigrants in mind. This should serve as a powerful message to our legislature here.
It’s still not too late for Connecticut to prioritize more robust, direct protections for immigrants and defend those who are very much a part of what makes Connecticut great.

You have spent the last five hours trying to explain to a government bureaucrat why there is a “clear public need” for the services your firm provides while a party with a financial interest in your failure tries to prove that no such need exists, all within a system explicitly designed to prevent firms like yours from expanding their services. 
With the conclusion of the hearing, you have now done all you can. All that remains is for the hearing officer to deliver his verdict. If he approves your application, great. If not, tough luck.
Such is the situation in which many people in the healthcare system find themselves in those states where Certificate of Need (CON) laws are still on the books, including Connecticut. These laws require healthcare providers to prove that there is a “clear public need” before they introduce or expand their services in an area, on the theory that this will prevent unnecessary capital expenditures by hospitals and thus contain healthcare costs. certificate-of-need laws are also often justified as a means to promote access to healthcare. Unfortunately, the weight of the evidence is that certificate-of-need laws have no measurable impact on healthcare costs, and a recent study, while not finding a statistically significant relationship, suggested that these laws considerably decrease healthcare access.
I do not have the means to replicate studies myself. I do, however, have access to the dockets for every certificate-of-need application in the state of Connecticut filed within the last few years. I spent some time over the summer looking through a few of them to gain a more complete picture of the certificate-of-need system beyond that given by the numbers. One case in particular stood out to me as putting every negative aspect of the system on full display.
Encompass Danbury
On August 29, 2025, Encompass Health opened the doors of a new rehab hospital in Danbury to care for patients who had suffered from strokes or bone injuries and could not receive adequate treatment elsewhere in Connecticut. Danbury’s mayor, Roberto Alves, was pleased to announce the occasion, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal thanked Encompass and remarked that such care has “helped save money because it prevents injuries and illnesses from recurring.” 
Left unmentioned was the fact that Encompass could have opened its doors two years earlier, had it not been for the Office of Health Strategy (OHS), the state agency responsible for administering Connecticut’s certificate-of-need program.
On August 14, 2020, Encompass filed a certificate-of-need application asking for permission to open a new rehab hospital in Danbury. Among other things, their application included multiple studies indicating the absence of this type of care in western Connecticut, plentiful testimony from doctors lamenting that they had been forced to send patients to Massachusetts for treatment, and supportive letters from the mayor and from two state representatives. Under these circumstances, the granting of a certificate of need should have been all but guaranteed.
Unfortunately for Encompass, while the public welcomed their services, the Nuvance-owned Danbury Hospital did not.  Nuvance alleged that there was, in fact, no gap in care in western Connecticut, that competition from Encompass would somehow increase the cost of rehabilitative care, and, worst of all, that allowing Encompass to operate would create an “unnecessary duplication of services.” Rather then expressing good-faith concern for patients’ pocketbooks, Nuvance was really worried that many patients would choose Encompass over them, thus hurting their bottom line.
That Nuvance’s allegations were without merit did not matter: OHS had to give them time to testify and present evidence, turning an ordinary hearing into an informal bench trial. This “trial” was held in October 2021, over a year after filing, over a Zoom call lasting from 10 in the morning to five in the evening. Over the course of the hearing, Nuvance tried to prove that it had enough bed capacity to service the rehab patients, while Encompass countered that it provided more intensive care than Nuvance and pointed to evidence that less intensive care was not a substitute for more intensive care.
After the hearing, there was silence for nearly a year. OHS finally released a proposed decision in 2022, denying the certificate of need. The reasoning was extensive, but boiled down to failure to demonstrate “clear public need” and failure to demonstrate that there would be no “unnecessary duplication of services.” Encompass appealed to then-Commissioner Deidre Gifford. Among other things, they pointed out that the author of the decision was inexperienced, committed numerous errors when stating the facts of the case, and improperly discounted Encompass’ methodology for determining the existence of a gap in rehab services.
While not relevant to the adjudication of the case, but a good indicator of the soundness of the certificate-of-need system, Encompass noted that Nuvance had pressured physicians to not voice support for the new facility and that, while OHS was dragging its feet, another firm had filed a certificate of need asking to open an intensive rehab facility in the same area. Thankfully for everyone (except for Nuvance’s corporate management), Gifford entered a final decision determining that Encompass’ services were needed and granting the certificate of need.
General problems with CONs
The Encompass case reveals many problems with certificates of need, the first of which is that they take too long. While there has been significant improvement over the past few years, the typical certificate-of-need case still takes over six months to process. These are six months where nothing can be done until the fate of the application is decided. Not only does the firm requesting a certificate of need pay the monetary cost of construction delays, but patients that could have been treated during that time pay with their health.
In addition to costs created by the delay, the firm must spend time and money producing the application and compiling the required information, as well as retain an attorney to guide them through the process and represent them at the hearing. While exact numbers are hard to come by, the typical certificate of need must cost over a $100,000.
Even so, if compliance costs were the only problem with certificates of need, I would probably not be writing this article. But certificate-of-need laws do evil by many means, the most pernicious of which is the intervenor system. By this system, established providers are allowed to weaponize the state government to protect their profits from competition by forcing applicants to fight both OHS and the intervenor and by convincing OHS to condition its approval on the applicant’s acceptance of unfavorable terms. If we despise officials who corruptly use their power to pick winners and losers, we ought to abhor a system that is designed to benefit one party at the expense of the other.
Finally, certificates of need are, to put it mildly, economic nonsense. Even those unfamiliar with the subject are aware that, when the supply of a good or service increases, its per-unit cost decreases. Most are also aware that, with a greater abundance of firms in a given field, competition between these firms will drive down the cost and raise the quality and specialization of care. Certificate-of-need laws flip this logic on its head: they purport to contain costs by reducing the supply of healthcare in a region. Worse, certificate-of-need laws deride competition— the lifeblood of capitalism and the essence of what makes America great— as nothing more than an “unnecessary duplication of services.”
The path forward is clear: certificate-of-need laws ought to be ended, not mended. There is little evidence that certificate-of-need laws lower the cost of or increase access to healthcare and considerable evidence that they have the opposite effect. At best, they pose an unnecessary hurdle for new health care projects in Connecticut; at worst, they reduce the availability of care in the state and harm patients’ health. As the legislature goes into session, they will be primarily concerned with addressing housing prices and federal funding cuts. 
They should consider abolishing certificates of need as well.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Spc. Ericka Gillespie)Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed an extension of the state’s disaster declaration on Saturday to continue emergency response and recovery efforts following the Western Alaska storms, including the remnants of Typhoon Halong. 
The original disaster declaration signed on Oct. 9 was set to expire on Sunday.
“The 30-day extension will enable recovery efforts to continue unencumbered so that the maximized amount of work can be completed before the onset of the winter freeze up in the region,” according to a statement from the governor’s office. 
The governor requested concurrence from leaders of the Alaska State Legislature and was met with support.
“I am in complete agreement on the 30 day extension and appreciate the Governor’s amended Disaster Declaration,” said Alaska State Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, in a statement.
“It’s been a yeoman’s job by everyone, and I’m very impressed by the dedication and the amount of time put in,” said Alaska Speaker of the House Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham. 
He said the extension is necessary. “It just makes good sense,” he said. “In a race with freeze-up and making as much progress as possible to get local residents back in their homes, if that is possible, in this very short amount of time that’s available.”
The disaster recovery effort on the Western Alaska coast is still underway, almost a month after a series of fall storms damaged or devastated coastal villages and displaced thousands of residents, primarily in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region. Recovery operations are focused on restoring critical infrastructure, including water, power, communications, and emergency home and boardwalk repairs, according to an update on Friday from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
The state’s disaster response effort is coordinating with federal agencies, regional tribal organizations, non-profits and local partners. The Trump administration announced a federal disaster declaration for Alaska on Oct. 22, promising a 100 percent cost share for the state’s relief efforts for 90 days, through January, according to the governor’s office. 
The Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management did not respond to a request for a cost estimate of the disaster relief effort to date, on Monday.
As of Friday, the most recent division update, the state has received 1,400 applications for state Individual Assistance and 719 applications for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Applications are still open.

The infected person contracted the virus during international travel, and the public was potentially exposed to that person Sunday evening at Armstrong New Orleans Airport, the Louisiana Department of Health said in a news release. The traveler with measles came through Concourse B and was outside the airport’s security checkpoint between 5-8:30 p.m.
Anyone who was on the same flight as the infected person is being notified, according to the health department.  
Officials said the infected person was not hospitalized and will remain in isolation until they are no longer infected. They were only identified as a resident of Region 9, which includes Livingston, St. Helena, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington parishes. Whether the person had received the measles vaccine was not known.
No additional information about the person was provided, with officials citing patient confidentiality.
Measles is highly contagious, especially among people who have not received the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Its infection rate is 90% among people who are unvaccinated and exposed. 
The virus can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. Measles can result in hospitalization and, in extreme cases, death. 
Measles symptoms typically present themselves seven to 12 days after exposure but can take up to 21 days to appear. Symptoms include: a fever of 101° F or higher; red, watery eyes; cough; runny nose; and a red and blotchy rash that appears after other symptoms, usually on the face at the hairline, and moves down the body.
Persons who believe they have been infected with measles should notify their health care provider before they see them in person to lower the risk for other patients and medical staff.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Legislature’s second special session ended after about four hours Monday, with both chambers quickly approving an allocation of up to $162.5 million to cover statewide food assistance through the start of next year in case it’s needed.
Acting Gov. Howie Morales also swiftly signed the bill early Monday evening.
Ultimately, the House voted 52-9, and the Senate voted 30-6, to approve a spending package with $162.5 million for SNAP going forward, plus $30 million to replenish a fund that paid for the 10 days’ worth of SNAP that ran out Monday. Only Republicans voted against the measure.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), the Senate Finance chair, said before the vote Monday that weekly payments totaling about $20 million will go to every SNAP recipient statewide beginning Dec. 1, unless the federal government reopens and begins paying for SNAP in full by then. The bill includes a provision that automatically ends the state payments when the government reopens.
New Mexico will supply $30M in emergency funding for food assistance

If federal funding lapses again, state funded emergency food benefits in House Bill 1 will be loaded on to New Mexicans’ EBT cards on a weekly basis until it’s restored or until the state Legislature returns for its regular session starting Jan. 20, 2026.
The spending package the lawmakers approved by a wide margin occurs amid a federal government shutdown that threatened to abruptly halt Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program payments to about 460,000 New Mexicans. 
Upon its passage, both state House and Senate Democrats issued news releases throughout the session and in statements following its end noted that the state had stepped in to counter the Trump administration. 
“Once again, our state is coming together to deliver the critical services New Mexicans cannot live without,” House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) said in a news release. 
Even as a possible deal emerged Sunday evening in the U.S. Senate, state Democrats in the majority said the chaotic back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and federal judges prompted them to take it upon themselves to ensure roughly one in five New Mexicans have money to eat over the holidays. 
Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo confirmed the state paid 100% of November SNAP benefits on Friday when ordered to do so by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and then was subsequently “ordered to claw that back. We are in the middle of a very confusing legal storm right now,” she said, “so the truth is, this is going to play out in the courts…We have issued those benefits in New Mexico, but we are also going to have to comply with whatever ultimate guidance we receive.”
Trump underscored the legal turmoil when his top litigator on Monday told the Supreme Court the administration was continuing its appeal of a federal ruling ordering it to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans. 
While New Mexico lawmakers committed to continuing to pay for SNAP if needed, Muñoz and other Democrats said conversations are ongoing with federal elected officials to reimburse New Mexico and other states that fronted their own funds for SNAP during the shutdown. 
NM Gov’s office says residents will continue to receive food assistance benefits

One possible vehicle could be the continuing resolution used to pay back federal workers and reopen the government, leaders said. 
“States — red, blue — we all stepped up to fill a gap here, a critical gap, so that reimbursement really needs to come,” said Majority Leader Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe)in a news conference after the Senate adjourned. 
The Republicans who voted against the measures said they did so largely because they blamed United States Senate Democrats, and particularly New Mexico’s Ben Ray Lujàn and Martin Heinrich, for the shutdown and the harm it caused. 
“When it comes to what happened in Washington, let’s be very clear,” said Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho). “Ben Ray Lujàn and Martin Heinrich voted to use the people of New Mexico as pawns to force the government to pay for subsidies for the unaffordable Care Act.”
Expiring Affordable Care Act health care insurance tax credits have been at the crux of the partisan division over the federal spending bill.
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

In response to that criticism from Brandt and others, Heinrich told Source New Mexico in a statement that Republicans “want us to pass a Republican funding bill that would result in working class New Mexicans paying thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars, more next year for their healthcare.”
Both Heinrich and Luján, along with most Democrats in the U.S. Senate, voted Sunday against a bill to reopen the government, citing the health insurance tax credits.
“We refuse to let Donald Trump bully us into choosing between a mother in Roswell feeding her kids, a couple in Española affording their health care premiums, or a VA employee in Albuquerque making their next rent payment,” Heinrich and Luján said in a joint statement following the vote.
Republicans also raised questions about New Mexico’s high status among states with the highest SNAP error rates, which are accidental over- or under-paying of SNAP recipients due to errors from applicants or state officials overseeing the program. According to state officials, the state has an error rate of 14.6%. 
US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown

Seeking ways to bring down the error rate, Republicans in both chambers introduced amendments that provide the state Health Care Authority $50,000 to evaluate ways to bring down the SNAP error rate.
The error rate could cost state taxpayers significantly. If the state does not reduce its error rate in the next few years, provisions in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will shift 15% of the state’s total SNAP spending onto the state, which amounts to $173 million, according to recent estimates. 
Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said the state’s high error rate is, at least in part, a product of the COVID-19 pandemic’s loosening of restrictions to receive SNAP. The state waived some reporting requirements, which was allowed but drove the error rate higher, Armijo explained in a committee hearing Monday. 
“We did that intentionally to keep New Mexicans fed,” she said. 
Democrat sponsors of the spending bill agreed to accept Republican amendments to appropriate $50,000 to evaluate the cause of the error rate. 
But Wirth also called the provisions “draconian,” saying he hopes Congress reconsiders the “error rate” penalty, which he said will hurt not only the state but also SNAP recipients. 
“Given New Mexico’s in the same position with a whole string of red states, I think Congress needs to take a deep breath and look at this and go back,” he said. “And really kind of look at the impact and the harm that’s causing.”

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)It’s been less than a week since Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherill won the governor’s race, and Democrats are lining up to run for her House seat.
The race to represent the 11th Congressional District includes a former congressman, an ex-Obama administration staffer, two county commissioners, and a mayor.
“I think the more people that jump in, the better,” said Brendan Gill, an Essex County commissioner and political strategist who formally launched his campaign for Sherrill’s seat on Monday.
Gill, standing alongside supporters in the pouring rain outside his childhood home in Montclair, touted his ties to the Essex County town and his work in organizing Democrats to help elect Sherrill governor last week.
“I think what will ultimately be the differentiator for my candidacy is what you saw here today, is that community, deep roots and local support, because people know what I’ve done, they know that I’ve delivered, and they know I can do it in the future,” Gill said.
Gill is expected to face former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett, White House alum Cammie Croft, and Morris Township Mayor Jeff Grayzel, among others.
The campaign is expected to be fierce. Montclair Mayor Renee Baskerville appeared to take a shot at Malinowski Monday when she noted that Gill is running for Congress “where he actually lives.”
Malinowski lives in Hunterdon County. The 11th District includes parts of Morris, Essex, and Passaic counties.

In a statement, Malinowski said he works in the 11th District — he teaches at Seton Hall University — and will be a voting resident of it before the primary.
“I’m the only candidate in the race who has represented any part of the 11th District in Congress, the only one with experience fighting Trump and delivering for New Jersey communities as a member of Congress, and the only one who will be battle ready the day I’m elected,” Malinowski said.
Malinowski represented the 7th Congressional District for two terms starting in 2019 — he was elected to Congress in the same Democratic wave that propelled Sherrill there — before losing reelection in 2022 to Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R). When Malinowski was first elected to the 7th District, it included some towns that are now in the 11th District.
“I’m running for Congress again, to pick up where my friend Mikie Sherrill left off,” Malinowski said in a video launching his campaign last week.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office after two terms in January, endorsed Gill while speaking with reporters at an unrelated event Monday. Murphy noted it’s an “impressive field” of candidates, but acknowledged he “wouldn’t be here without Brendan’s support.”
Gill managed Murphy’s first campaign for governor in 2017, and prior to that managed campaigns for Sen. Cory Booker and the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
It’s not entirely clear when the candidates will compete to succeed Sherrill, whose current House term runs until Jan. 3, 2027. She has yet to resign from the House, and the governor cannot call a special election to find her replacement until she does. She becomes governor on Jan. 20 and cannot also serve in Congress.
She said last week she’d work with leadership in both the House and the state Legislature to “get a new person in that seat.” She said she “likely won’t be getting involved.”
The 11th District had been a Republican stronghold before Sherrill won it in 2018. Its boundaries have since been redrawn to make it safer for Democrats to win.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Mainers have begun to receive food assistance benefits for the month, despite conflicting guidance from the Trump administration, which continued its effort to withhold funding Monday.
About 97% of all 170,000 recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in Maine will receive full benefits, and others will get about 65%, which includes mostly new SNAP applicants, according to public guidance issued by the Office for Family Independence, which is part of the state health department that administers the program.
Whether Maine will be on the hook for paying for the already issued November benefits remains to be determined, but that seems unlikely, according to Justin Strasburger, executive director of anti-hunger nonprofit Full Plates, Full Potential.
“The good, stable news is about the SNAP recipients themselves. They have the funds for the month of November,” he said. “The state and federal government may end up having to go back and forth and figure out who is paying for all of this.”
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture directed states to make full SNAP benefits available to recipients, following a lower court ruling. Maine was among several states to follow that guidance, directing the vendor that issues benefits on EBT cards to make them available by Monday. But the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which paused the order late Friday, and returned to the court Monday to continue its fight against releasing full payments. 
“That the President would then petition the highest court to deny food to hungry families and seniors is beyond belief and is callous and cruel,” Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement on Sunday. “The President should not be directing states to take food out of the mouths of the hungry.”
Several lower courts have ordered USDA to release full SNAP payments, but whether the federal government will be reimbursing the vendors that administer benefits is unclear.
“How this all plays out in the courts is still, you know, up for debate, and it is not fully settled, sadly,” Strasburger said. “So until the shutdown is over, I think we’re going to continue to have some question marks about all this and lots of legal action.”

State Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, announced his candidacy on Monday. He is the second Democrat in the race, after former Senate Minority Leader Tom Begich, also of Anchorage. The other 12 declared candidates are Republicans.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, is term-limited and not running.
Claman, an attorney and former Anchorage Assembly chair and acting mayor, has served in the Legislature since 2015. He served first in the House before being elected to the Senate in 2022. He is among the leaders of that body’s bipartisan majority caucus and chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
In a statement, Claman referred to his experience in the bipartisan caucus.
“As Governor, I’ll work every day to ensure our state government reflects the values we all share: safe streets, great schools, business-friendly regulations, and a growing economy that works for businesses and working families,” he said in the statement. “Our state deserves a leader who listens to and works together with the people of Alaska, leads with care, upholds our constitution, and sets partisanship aside to deliver real results. That’s exactly what I’ve done in the Legislature and what I’ll do for you as your governor.”
Claman, who represents West Anchorage, was reelected to the Senate last year. He would not be up for reelection until 2028.
In a brief interview Monday, Claman said he timed his announcement with fundraising rules in mind.
“It’s basically a year before the election. Because of the limits on fundraising – and I’m not going to resign – I need to get started before the session,” he said.
Under state law, sitting legislators may not raise campaign funds during legislative sessions, which in 2026 is scheduled to run from Jan. 21 to May 20.
Claman said he started sending out fundraising solidifications after he filed his notice of intent to run for governor.
Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola is considered by observers to be the strongest potential Democratic candidate for governor, but she is also a possible candidate for U.S. Senate. Several Democratic leaders have urged her to challenge Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who is up for reelection next year.
The primary election date is Aug. 18, 2026. The candidate filing deadline is June 1.
Alaska’s gubernatorial candidates will compete in an open primary, with the top four finishers facing off in the general election under the state’s ranked-choice system.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Illuminator) The Louisiana Board of Ethics confirmed Friday that elected officials and political candidates can use their campaign money for expenses related to Washington Mardi Gras following a law change earlier this year. 

The ethics board issued an advisory opinion last week to Mandeville Mayor Clay Madden, stating he can legally use campaign funds to cover his Washington Mardi Gras expenses. Madden intends to go to the event, which take place in 2026 during the last week of January, in his official capacity as a city representative. 
“The Mayor intends to travel to the 2026 ‘Washington Mardi Gras’ event to engage in meetings with various stakeholders, including constituents, other municipal leaders, parish presidents, state legislators, and U.S. senators and representatives,” Elizabeth Sconzert, Mandeville’s city attorney, wrote in an email to the ethics board in August. 
Washington Mardi Gras is an annual, four-day festival held in the nation’s capital featuring a formal Mardi Gras ball, parade, black-tie gala, business luncheons, political fundraisers and several parties thrown by and for the politically connected. Some of Louisiana’s large companies and lobbyists are among the most visible sponsors of the event.

Including airfare, hotel stays, krewe membership dues, event tickets and formal attire, it easily costs thousands of dollars for an individual to take part in the festivities. 
Elected officials have, for years, used their campaign funds to go to Washington Mardi Gras, held at the Washington Hilton Hotel. Nearly $600,000 from Louisiana campaigns and political action committees accounts went to cover Washington Mardi Gras expenses in 2024 alone.  

But whether all this spending was allowed under state ethics laws has been unclear. The ethics board’s guidance on whether political campaign money could be used for Mardi Gras-related expenses has been muddled. 
State law generally bans the use of campaign funds and political action committee money for “personal use,” but the Louisiana Legislature carved out a explicit exception for Washington Mardi Gras spending earlier this year. 

Under the new law, political candidates can use their campaign accounts to cover costs related to their attendance, as well as that of their spouses and children, at “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.” 

Prior to the law change, legislators had complained the ethics board was scrutinizing campaign account spending on Washington Mardi Gras.

Cory Booker of New Jersey, points to a poster depicting rising medical costs if Congress allows the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Late Sunday night, seven Democratic U.S. senators, including Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, and one Independent, joined their Republican colleagues to overcome the filibuster and move forward on a vote to reopen the government. It’s a signal that the ongoing shutdown, which has now lasted a record 40 days, may be coming to an end soon. 
But Congressman Brendan Boyle (D-Philadelphia) is calling on his colleagues to reject the current proposal should it make it to the House.
“This bill that does not in any way address the health care crisis, and only includes a vague reference to a promise of a senate vote a month from now, is wholly insufficient to address the health care crisis facing the American people,” Boyle said at a press conference Monday.
The shutdown was initiated by Democrats, who demanded Republicans restore what are known as enhanced premium tax credits for people receiving health care through the Affordable Care Act. Without the Premium Tax Credits, nearly 22 million Americans, including around 500,000 Pennsylvanians, could see their monthly health care premiums rise by more than double the current rates on average.

For nearly 40 days, Democrats refused to join Republicans in voting to fund the government without a deal in place to restore the Premium Tax Credits before they expire at the end of the year. But on Sunday, they agreed to fund the government through January, with only a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) that the chamber will vote on extending them in the coming month.
“We have a pinky promise of a possible future vote with no guarantee of passage and no commitment from House Republican leadership or the White House,” Boyle said. “So what we essentially have is a promise about nothing.”
Boyle was joined by Vicki Miller, the leader of Indivisible Philadelphia, an organization that advocates for progressive causes. 
Miller said Democratic senators who voted to move forward with a vote to reopen the government were effectively turning on voters across the country who handed the party a series of wins in local and statewide elections last Tuesday, including maintaining a liberal majority on Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court.
“We succeed in giving the Democrats a huge victory,” she said. “We are just surprised that they would give in this easily.”
Fetterman, who has opposed the shutdown since it began, was one of the Democrats who voted with his GOP colleagues to move forward with a vote to reopen the government.
“After 40 days as a consistent voice against shutting our government down, I voted YES for the 15th time to REOPEN,” Fetterman wrote on the social media platform X. “I’m sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven’t been paid in weeks. It should’ve never come to this. This was a failure.”
As a result of the shutdown, access to food assistance funding for millions of Americans has been threatened, delayed or stopped, and many government employees, including some members of the military, have gone without pay. 
The proposed deal to end the shutdown, however, would restore federal workers who were laid off in the last 40 days and ensure backpay for furloughed federal workers, which the Trump administration has argued they aren’t required to do, despite 2019 legislation signed in the president’s first term requiring it. It would also fund the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program through September 2026.
Maureen May, president of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals, joined Boyle on Monday in opposing the move by Fetterman, six of his Democratic colleagues and Sen. Angus King of Maine (an independent who caucuses with Democrats) to accept the deal and help Republicans overcome the filibuster. 
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

From her perspective, the issue of ensuring that health care is affordable, is worth the temporary pain of a federal government shutdown. 
Working as a nurse before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2008, she said she’s seen what happens when patients can’t afford health insurance.
“Patients will end up in the emergency room. People will skip their meds. They’ll ration. Our patients will be sicker coming into the ER,” she said. “These are the consequences of 150,000 people losing their premium cuts and being able to take care of them and their families.”
The Pennsylvania Insurance Department has estimated that 150,000 Pennsylvanians may lose health insurance altogether if the enhanced premium tax credits expire and the monthly premiums on their marketplace plans increase.
To pass the proposed bill the Senate will still have to take a formal vote on it, which is expected as soon as Monday night. Then, the House would have to agree to the bill before it goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.
While only simple majorities in the House and Senate are required, and both chambers controlled by Republicans, Boyle says he will continue to fight to keep the government shutdown without a firm agreement to extend the enhanced premium tax credits.
“We have total unity among House Democrats from our leader all the way down,” Boyle said. “We had a couple of House Republicans vote against this the first time. There are going to be a number – maybe a couple dozen or more – Congressional Republicans facing very challenging reelections next year. They have every interest to work with us on this issue and solve this health care crisis now.”
Yet it’s unclear if any Republican will relent. 
Rep. Scott Perry (R-Cumberland), a member of the Freedom Caucus who represents one of Pennsylvania’s most competitive districts — the 10th, has said he will hold firm.
“After 41 days of ‘leveraging’ people’s lives, at least 8 Democrats seem to be getting the message that the attempt to force through their most radical demands onto the backs of the American People isn’t going to work,” he wrote on Facebook. “WE NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Schumer-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 19:57:52.657442

Massachusetts health care over the years has tended to resemble the “Perils of Pauline” — with one train or another barreling down the tracks toward us. Somehow, however, the system has always survived more or less intact.    
This year, things seem quite different, and the hearings come as the well-being of the health care system is under a greater series of threats than any time in recent history. A confluence of challenges points to very hard times for the Massachusetts health care system.   
Here are the main areas of concern.   
System and Family Unaffordability: During the time since the HPC came into existence in 2012, we have not witnessed the sort of health care spending and premium growth that we are seeing right now. Per capita state spending growth continued its three-year rise above the 3.6 percent benchmark, with the most recent measure more than double that target, at 8.6 percent.  
That growth is being driven by hospital and pharmaceutical spending, and is now reflected in double-digit premium increases across all forms of commercial insurance. This fall, the Division of Insurance, after rejecting even higher rates, approved an average increase of 13.4 percent for the individual and small group market for 2026. Our state’s own insurance plan for state workers and retirees, overseen by the Group Insurance Commission, had to seek a $250 million bailout for the fiscal year in June because the upward trend in medical care spending and use of the GLP-1 weight loss drugs by plan beneficiaries had blown away actuarial estimates for pharmaceutical utilization. In all, more than 40 percent of residents report difficulty in paying for health care. 
Upcoming Growth of the Under- and Uninsured: Ever since passage of the 2006 health care reform law known as Romneycare, Massachusetts has not seen significant yearly increases in the number of uninsured in the state. But passage earlier this year of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (House Resolution 1), which will trigger over $1 trillion in cuts to health and human service programs nationally, especially for Medicaid, over 10 years, will likely result in about 10 million Americans losing Medicaid coverage over the decade.  
A Blue Cross Blue Foundation of Massachusetts study estimates that the number of uninsured in Massachusetts will increase by more than 50 percent based on this law alone, which adds new work requirement and paperwork burdens for maintaining Medicaid coverage and new verification requirements for buyers of subsidized plans on Affordable Care Act exchanges.  
Many more are now expected to drop ACA coverage, sold here through the Health Connector, if enhanced ACA premium subsidies, set to expire on December 31, are not renewed—now even more likely to occur as the move to reopen the federal government came without any deal to maintain them. Add to this a good number more who obtain coverage through the merged market or through employers and are healthy—who may either buy plans with more cost sharing or forego coverage altogether.  
Hospitals: We are accustomed to the reality that the story of Massachusetts hospitals, like those in other states, has become a tale of two cities. “Emerald City” providers such as Mass General Brigham, Boston Children’s, and Dana-Farber are secure, while a growing set of “Gotham City” providers, such as Baystate Health and Tufts Medicine, are financially challenged and in need of state support.  
Medicaid cuts are especially threatening to the “Gotham City” group as they face increasing numbers of uninsured patients. In late September, Gov. Healey and the Legislature approved $200 million in supplemental payments to hospitals, though this is no way represents a long-term fix for the most challenged in the group. 
Even the wealthier providers, however, despite net asset increases fueled by investment gains, are challenged to stay financially stable right now. Well-heeled Mass General Brigham recently announced staff layoffs and other cuts to protect their bottom line.  
Recissions and planned future cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget by the Trump administration are an added serious threat to our “Emerald City” providers, who are among the top recipients of federal research in the nation. Added to this group’s challenges is that the state’s biopharma industry is now shedding jobs and failing to attract much new investment. This will likely have spillover effects on our major teaching hospitals, which often gain revenue from contracts with the biopharma industry. 
Community Health Centers: The state’s proud network of community health centers are triple losers from President Trump’s policies.  Attacks on immigrants will eliminate Medicaid even for those with legal status. Many others who rely on subsidized Health Connector plans will become uninsured patients. Meanwhile, changes to the federal drug purchasing program that allow health centers to gain some margin by reselling drugs they obtain at a discount is slated to be cut back, threatening this important revenue stream that allows many to get to breakeven on operations.   
The Legislature, mindful of these cuts, allocated $35 million to them directly, plus a share of the $77 million identified for the Health Safety Net Trust Fund. Even with this help, the future is very uncertain for a number of health centers. 
Primary Care: Primary care remains broken as we await policy recommendations from the state commission established to address inadequate availability, payments, and burnout among those in this sector. The crisis is moving some to unionize, while others are moving into concierge or direct primary care practices. 
Meanwhile, big for-profit companies remain active trying their own approaches to getting richer through primary care. Optum-owned Atrius Health is acquiring Acton Medical Associates to gain market share, while CVS and Mass General Brigham decided there is money to be made by joining together to turn Minute Clinics into primary care outlets in 27 locations with what appears to be MGB-branded solo nurse practitioners holding down the store.  
It remains unclear whether any of these developments will ameliorate the primary care shortage that keeps getting worse. 
Insurers: Finally, our dominant non-profit insurers, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Point 32, a duo we expected to be stable in good times and bad, have been losing significant money these past few years. There is mounting worry that Point 32’s growing financial hole and diminishing reserves may trigger a buyout proposal from a national for-profit. This would be a cataclysmic moment for Massachusetts’s mostly non-profit insurance system. And Blue Cross, which saw $400 million-plus in losses last year, and expects a negative operating margin of $700+ million in 2025, may not be immune from wanting to explore a conversion or a merger to strengthen its capital base. 
When you put all of this together, the threats to the public health, health care provider, and health care training ecosystem in Massachusetts are as serious as any we’ve seen in decades.  
It will be one thing for those speaking at this week’s Health Policy Commission hearings to tee up the serious, multifaceted challenges we’re facing. The real test will be charting a course of action that lays out a plan for what to do about it all.

The 12-member panel returned the verdicts Monday, finding Denroy Dasent guilty in a pair of killings that took place on the same night in Burlington and South Burlington in 2022.

BURLINGTON — A jury convicted a former Burlington man of two counts of murder in the fatal shootings of two men on the same night in neighboring towns more than three years ago.
Denroy Dasent’s defense team had argued that it was a case of mistaken identity, while the prosecutors said the evidence “unequivocally” pointed to Dasent as the killer.
Jurors deliberated more than four hours before returning the guilty verdicts against Dasent on two charges of second-degree murder. The charges stem from the fatal shootings on Oct. 2, 2022, of 40-year-old Sheiknoor Osman and 37-year-old Brian K. Billings II. 
The jury’s verdict Monday followed a trial that stretched over five days in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. 
Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George, whose office prosecuted the case, spoke to reporters outside the courtroom and thanked the jurors. She said of the verdict, “It came with an amount of time that showed the jury took it very seriously.” 
George said the motive for the two killings remains unclear.
Dasent’s defense team declined to comment. 
Dasent, who fidgeted in his chair at the defense table throughout the trial and at times clasped his hands in front of himself, did not appear to display any emotions as the jury foreperson announced the verdicts. Dasent did not testify in his own defense.
Many of Billings’ family and friends, who said Billings was known as “Little B,” attended each day of the trial. Several of them cried as the verdicts were read. It was not clear if Osman had family members in the courtroom. 
Billings’ family members in a written statement after the verdict thanked the police investigators, the prosecutor team and the jury. 
“Brian was a Dad first and foremost and his fiancé Kylie and his children were his whole world,” the statement read. 
“These past three years have been the hardest of our lives,” the statement added. “Our ‘new normal’ is heartbreaking and hard to navigate and anything but normal. B was a good man with a huge heart, who loved everyone!! His smile came easy and his laughter contagious.”
Eyewitness testimony
The prosecutors during the trial highlighted eyewitness accounts as well as other evidence tying Dasent to the killings. That testimony included a firearms expert who connected shell casings recovered from both shooting scenes to a gun Dasent told investigators he had thrown into Lake Champlain moments before he was arrested.
Prosecutors presented little information about the connection, if any, between Dasent and the two victims. At the time of the shootings, Osman had been dating Billings’ sister.
Dasent’s defense attorneys contended throughout the trial that neither the evidence nor testimony clearly identified their client as the killer in either case.
Dasent, 55, has been jailed since his arrest shortly after the two deadly shootings. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges and remained in custody without bail pending his trial.
Tricia Guyette had testified on the trial’s first day that a man had forced his way into the Pine Street apartment where she had been with Osman on the night of the deadly attack a little after 8 p.m.
She told jurors Osman was in bed when the man entered the room. That man, armed with a Glock gun, repeatedly shot Osman, Guyette testified, adding that the shooter did not speak or display any emotions. 
In a 911 call Guyette made after the shooting, a recording of which was played for jurors in court, the only description she provided of the shooter was that he was a Black man. She later told police she was aware the shooter was known to others as “Denny” and said he was a frequent visitor to the Pine Street residence, which was a place where people would use and buy drugs. 
The second fatal shooting took place about three hours later, around 11 p.m., at the Swiss Host Motel in South Burlington. Kylie Clark, who lived there with Billings, testified during the trial that a person had come to the door that night seeking to speak to Billings and Billings went outside to talk to him.   
Clark told jurors she heard gunshots moments later, and Billings came back into the apartment bleeding. He collapsed and died, she said.  
Clark testified that she and Billings knew the person who had come to their door that night as “Delroy.” She said she knew that “Delroy” had lived at the Swiss Host Motel in the past and that he operated a restaurant in the food court of the University Mall in South Burlington. Denroy Dasent along with his wife had run the Island Passion restaurant at the mall.
Both Clark and Guyette identified Dasent as the shooter during their testimony, pointing to him at the defense table as he sat between his two attorneys.  
Dasent’s statements
Prosecutors during the trial played police video of Dasent as he was taken into custody on Burlington’s waterfront shortly after the second killing. Police had pursued Dasent there after spotting a tan sport-utility vehicle he was driving that matched the description of the vehicle witnessed earlier that night near the scene of the Pine Street homicide. 
In that video, Dasent said that he had “clapped” two people, a term that Burlington Police Lt. Michael Beliveau told jurors during his testimony meant he had killed them. Dasent could also be heard on the video stating, “I will kill for my kids.” 
In another police video, Dasent could be heard repeatedly referring to Osman by his nickname, “Snake,” and he appeared to make disparaging remarks about both Billings and Osman. He also could be heard alleging inappropriate behavior from the two men.
At one point during the questioning from the investigators, Dasent was asked what offenses he should face and he described himself as a “vigilante.”
Chittenden County Deputy State’s Attorney Sally Adams, in her more than hourlong closing argument Monday, told jurors those allegations against the two men were “nonsensical.” She said there was no evidence to back up those claims from Dasent. 
Defense attorney Daniel Maguire, in his much shorter closing remarks to the jury, said it was difficult to make too much about what his client told detectives after his arrest since it couldn’t be heard clearly and he appeared highly agitated.
Maguire told jurors that he didn’t believe that Dasent offered any “rational” motive for why he would want to carry out either of the fatal shootings.
Maguire also highlighted in closing argument the testimony of Keith Winters, who told jurors from the witness stand that he lived next door to Clark and Billings at the Swiss Host Motel at the time of the shooting there.
Winters testified that a person had come to his door shortly before the shooting asking who his neighbor was. Winters said he told the man that his neighbor was Brian Billings. 
Next, Winters testified, he heard gunshots outside his residence and he called police.
Winters told jurors he could not say with any certainty that the man who came to his apartment that night was Dasent. He said the lighting was bad, making it difficult to see. Winters called the man “polite” and noted he did not have an accent. Dasent had a heavy Caribbean accent in recordings of his voice played by prosecutors in the trial.
Maguire also raised questions about inconsistencies in Guyette’s testimony, saying she testified that the shooter spoke with an accent but also testified that the shooter did not speak during the shooting at the Pine Street apartment.
During their deliberations Monday, the jurors listened to an audio playback of Guyette’s testimony and they rewatched two police videos in which Dasent provided statements.
Gun evidence
Prosecutors also presented video evidence of Dasent telling police that while he was at the waterfront prior to his arrest, he threw a gun into the lake. A state police dive team found a Glock gun two days after the shootings in the lake near where Dasent was taken into custody.
Harry Jeppe, a firearms examiner with the Vermont Forensic Laboratory, told jurors that his analysis of markings on the shell casings recovered from both fatal shooting scenes showed they were fired from that same Glock recovered from the lake. 
The serial number of the weapon also matched a weapon Dasent’s wife, Suesan Dasent, testified during the trial that she had purchased in 2021 at a Chittenden County sporting goods store.
Suesan Dasent did not initially appear in court to testify. Police had to go and find her and take her into custody, bringing her to court to take the witness stand for the prosecution.
She testified that she kept the Glock gun in a locked case, and the key to the case was on the same ring as those for the tan Toyota 4Runner she owned with her husband. That was the same vehicle police found at the waterfront when they arrested Denroy Dasent.
Each murder charge against Dasent carries the possibility of life in prison. No sentencing date was immediately set.

Two Montana communities have expressed substantial interest in becoming the location for a new state women’s prison facility following a Department of Corrections request for information. Two more responded to the state’s request for information but cited resident concerns and opposition in their submission. 
The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Commission and City of Deer Lodge expressed strong desire for consideration, as did Big Horn County and Hardin, which said their southeastern location was the “most appropriate and advantageous.”
Butte-Silver Bow and Jefferson also submitted responses, but acknowledged residents expressed serious concerns and opposition to becoming a new prison site. 
Montana’s state-run correctional facilities have been faced with overcrowding for years, and the issue drew a lot of discussion in Helena during the Legislature.
During the 2025 session, lawmakers appropriated $436 million to address capacity issues throughout the state.
One funding allocation came from House Bill 833, sponsored by Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, which set aside roughly $250 million to construct a new women’s prison or renovate an existing facility.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan during the session, Fitzpatrick said the women’s prison in Billings houses 240 people, Montana needs beds for at least 400.
“Unlike the men, we have no place to put them out of state,” he told the Daily Montanan. The state has contracts to send male inmates to privately run prisons in other states. 
Fitzpatrick’s bill includes a study the Department of Corrections will lead to determine a new location for a women’s prison — not excluding Billings or Deer Lodge, where the men’s prison is located, but not favoring them either, he said.
“It could be anywhere,” Fitzpatrick said.
The Department of Corrections sent out a Request for Information on Sept. 10 seeking feedback from local communities interested in being an option to host the prison.
Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Commission voted unanimously on a resolution indicating its support for locating a new prison in the county and submitted an 18-page packet detailing the county’s history with running state-controlled institutions. 
“We believe that the long-term success of the new prison rests with siting it in a location where it will be welcomed rather than another community where the state simply owns land but where the local population may be hostile, skeptical, or indifferent to having the facility in its midst,” Commission Chairman Mike Beausoleil wrote. 
The Montana State Prison has been located in Deer Lodge since 1871 when it was founded as a territorial prison, and the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs began as a territorial facility in 1877. 
The Montana Tuberculosis Sanitarium at Galen opened in 1913 and was also operated to house developmentally disabled residents and as a site for a state alcohol treatment program, according to the county’s documents. 
“State institutions have been a part of Deer Lodge County’s economy and culture for over 150 years,” the proposal states. “… While Anaconda is famous for its once massive copper smelter and owes its existence to the birth of copper mining in Butte, the state institutions were a vital source of income within the county. It is not hyperbole to say that after the smelter closed in 1981, it was employment at the state hospital and, especially, the state prison which kept Anaconda alive.”
Deer Lodge County offered two potential locations for a new women’s prison, one adjacent to the Montana State Hospital Forensic Unit at Galen, and two sites adjacent to the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs. 
At a public hearing held by the county commission, only six individuals opposed the plan, according to county staff. 
Big Horn County and the city of Hardin touted community experience with similar facilities and a readiness to begin building immediately.
“Hardin brings relevant experience through past correctional facility operations, which have helped develop leadership familiar with the demands of such institutions,” Hardin Mayor Joe Purcell wrote in a letter of support. “Importantly, this proposal has strong community and political support. We view this as a valuable partnership — one that meets a critical public safety need for the state while offering lasting economic benefits for our region.”
Big Horn County’s proposal emphasizes proactive actions already taken by the county and Hardin to expedite the building of a women’s prison. 
The proposal identifies over 1,000 acres of county-owned land “that is ready for correctional use,” with an estimated $15 million-$20 million in infrastructure savings compared to using a barren site, and the possibility of donating the land to the state to jumpstart the project. 
The county also cited an elevated unemployment rate of 5.8% as a “ready and available labor pool” to mitigate a risk of staffing shortages at the new facility, as well as the proximity to two tribal colleges, which could aid in developing and implementing vocational training for inmates and staff. 
Big Horn’s proposal is also backed by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Crow Tribe of Indians.  
Both Butte-Silver Bow and Jefferson County’s responses sent to DOC highlighted community opposition to a new prison facility. 
In a letter, Butte-Silver Bow Chief Executive J.P. Gallagher wrote that the prison “is not perceived as a benefit to community development,” citing workforce concerns, and a lack of housing and infrastructure capacity. A piece of state-owned land in the county that could be considered is smaller than the 40 acres DOC set as a minimum. 
He wrote that the city-county commission had sent a letter seeking more information from DOC, but did not receive a response.
The community of Boulder, meanwhile, saw “almost all” attendees at a public meeting oppose the idea of a new corrections facility in the town, though “comments from constituents aside from the meeting have mostly been supportive.”
Boulder is already home to the former Riverside Special Needs Unit, where in May, DOC relocated 50 female inmates from the Montana Women’s Prison in Billings to reduce overcrowding. 
The state owns a 122-acre parcel that includes the Riverside facility. There are additional similar facilities nearby, including the Elkhorn Treatment Center and a campus of the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch. 
The letter sent from the county cited concerns with local workforce staffing, Boulder’s volunteer-run emergency service programs, and the available medical and behavioral health services locally. 
Neither the county commission nor city officials provided letters of support for a Boulder-based correctional facility. 
According to the Department of Corrections secure facility dashboard, there are currently 246 inmates at the Montana Women’s Prison, which has an operational capacity of 250, in addition to the 50 inmates at the Riverside Facility in Boulder.  
Meanwhile, the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, has 1,514 inmates with a capacity of 1,551. A total of 1,500 inmates are currently housed in contracted facilities, including one in Shelby and one in Dawson County.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-0188-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 19:57:52.657442

Scott Applewhite
All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation say they’re opposed to a tentative deal advancing in the U.S. Senate Monday that would end the historic federal government shutdown.
The proposal had support from eight members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus even though it would not immediately extend the health insurance tax credits that have been central to Democrats’ demands throughout the impasse. Vermont’s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch were not among those who joined most Republicans to pass a procedural vote on the measure late Sunday.
The now-bipartisan plan, which still needed to clear a number of hurdles as of Monday evening, would fund the federal government through at least Jan. 30, 2026, as well as provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026, among other provisions.

In exchange for their support, the eight senators who crossed party lines — including New Hampshire Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both Democrats, and Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats — have a commitment from President Donald Trump’s administration to rehire federal workers fired at the start of the shutdown. They also received a promise from Senate GOP leaders for a December floor vote on legislation that would extend the expiring Affordable Care Act credits, which are slated to lapse at the end of 2025.
The subsidies help millions of low- and middle-income people afford the cost of their health insurance premiums. Without them, tens of thousands of people in Vermont would see their health care costs skyrocket, and many would likely no longer be able to afford coverage.
That’s the reason the state’s congressional delegation criticized the funding deal: the promise of a future vote, they argue, does not guarantee any subsidy extension would actually become law. 
Sanders said on the Senate floor Sunday that the assurance of a December vote is “a totally meaningless gesture” because he does not believe the Republican-controlled House would actually take up such a measure, nor would Trump sign it into law.

“Tonight was not a good night,” Sanders said in a separate video statement posted to his social media feeds later on Sunday. “This was a very, very bad vote.”
Welch, in an interview Monday afternoon, said he was disappointed that eight of his fellow caucus members backed the GOP-led proposal and said he intended to continue voting against the plan in the coming days.
Reporting by The Hill last week named Welch as one of a group of Democratic senators who had been meeting in the U.S. Capitol to discuss a resolution to the shutdown. The group also included Shaheen, Hassan and King, who ultimately voted for Sunday’s deal.
Welch said Monday that meeting was one of a number of different negotiations he has been part of in recent weeks, with senators from both parties, to attempt to find a breakthrough on the shutdown. He said he had consistently advocated for extending the health care credits in all of those conversations. Once the discussion turned more toward the idea of a future vote on the health insurance subsidies, rather than an extension written into a deal to reopen the government, he said he stepped away.
“That’s when I was unable to continue in those negotiations — because I believe we had to have an outcome that would guarantee relief to the folks in Vermont, and around the country, who depend on these,” the senator said.
It was not entirely clear Monday evening when the Senate would vote again on the possible breakthrough legislation. Assuming it clears the Senate, the measure would then go to the House for further consideration. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday told reporters his colleagues should start returning to the Capitol as soon as possible.

Vermont’s sole U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, a Democrat, said in an interview Monday that she thought it was “a mistake” for eight members of her party’s Senate caucus to side with Republicans. Her party needs to “hold the damn line,” she said, as they have done for the past five-plus weeks. The shutdown was in its 41st day on Monday, now by far the longest in U.S. history.
“We’re fools if we think that at this moment, at the eleventh hour, this promise of a vote to extend the ACA subsidies is anything other than just a game,” Balint said. 
She said she did not think Republicans had any viable plan to improve people’s access to health care. Instead, she sees the party’s opposition to making the expanded health insurance subsidies permanent as its latest effort to dismantle key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
If the version of the deal being advanced in the Senate reaches the House, Balint said Monday, “It’s a ‘hell no’ from me.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-10 23:57:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi begins issuing partial SNAP benefits amid federal government shutdown,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/10/mississippi-begins-issuing-partial-snap-benefits/,Confusion over how states should distribute the benefits has mounted in the past week after the Trump administration contested a court order directing the federal government to issue full benefits.,"Mississippi will begin distributing up to 65% of food assistance benefits for the month of November to recipients, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Monday. 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are distributed on a rolling basis between the 4th and 21st of each month. Recipients who were scheduled to receive SNAP benefits earlier this month but have not yet due to the federal government shutdown will begin receiving partial assistance as early as today, the agency said in a press release. Others will receive their benefits on their regularly scheduled date.
Mississippi is distributing up to 65% of SNAP benefits to recipients in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program, said the state Department of Human Services in a statement. Full benefits will be distributed once the federal government approves their release. 
“Benefit amounts have been set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, not MDHS,” the statement said.
Beneficiaries in Mississippi receive $183 on average in food assistance per month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Partial benefits for the average beneficiary would amount to a loss of about $65 in aid in November. 
“The hardworking families in Mississippi who already struggle to make ends meet and have tight budgets that include SNAP help are relying on them to ensure wellness in their homes,” Dr. Patricia Tibbs, the president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, previously told Mississippi Today.
Confusion over how states should distribute the benefits has mounted in the past week after the Trump administration contested a court order directing the federal government to issue full benefits. 
New food assistance benefits have not been issued to Mississippians since Nov. 1. Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government said Oct. 24 that it could not use emergency funds to pay for the program, spurring a legal battle over the paused benefits.
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the federal government on Oct. 31 to use emergency funds to continue funding the program after more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration over its refusal to issue the benefits. 
The federal Department of Agriculture initially told states to distribute no more than half of November’s SNAP benefits, before later revising that guidance to instruct states to issue up to 65 percent of benefits. A federal judge in Rhode Island then ordered the agency to fund the program in full. 
The Trump administration released guidance Nov. 7 indicating it was “working towards implementing” full benefits, even as it appealed a court ruling. Twenty states, including New York, California and North Carolina, began to issue full benefits, but after a stay of the order, the administration ordered states to “undo” the issuance of full benefits and warned it would penalize states that proceeded. 
A federal judge then temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ordering states to roll back full SNAP payments. On Monday, the administration returned to the Supreme Court in another attempt to halt full funding for food assistance. 
The federal government shutdown, now reaching 41 days, is the longest in U.S. history, but Congress appeared closer than ever to reaching a resolution on Monday. That latest development came after eight senators broke ranks with Democrats and joined Republicans in a vote to fund the government through Jan. 30 Sunday night. The legislation still needs to pass the House in order for the shutdown to end.
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has previously said he will not move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program until the federal shutdown ends, even though pediatricians and some state legislators urged the governor to do so. 
“There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing,” he wrote in a social media post Oct. 27. 
The day before benefits were paused, Reeves requested a waiver from the federal government to restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks. If approved, the changes would take effect in 2027. 
Other changes to SNAP benefits are set to take effect this month as a result of federal budget legislation President Donald Trump signed into law in July. The law increases the existing work requirement’s upper age limit from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to people who were previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but to qualify, parents must have children younger than 14 — down from age 18.
Recipients do not have to do anything to receive their benefits, according to the press release from the state Department of Human Services.

(Getty Images)After facing public outcry, the Salt Lake County Council Republican majority voted to extend the life of four affordable child care centers the county owns and subsidizes until the end of May of 2026 with a rate increase.
The council held a quick special meeting Tuesday where members voted 5-3 to continue the programs that families of 270 children rely on through next year, for an added fee. But, still staring down an end date, parents have only a temporary sense of relief. 
“I think they’re really focusing on kicking this problem down the road, instead of addressing it now,” said Mackenzie Miller, a parent of a 3-year-old who goes to the Magna Recreation Center day care.

According to a child care service analysis the Salt Lake County Council commissioned, monthly rates are different depending on kids’ ages and services, with participating families paying $460 for all-day preschool, $290 for before- and after-school programs, and $470 for summer camp, among other programs. 
County fees are about 50% to 60% below market rates resulting in an annual county subsidy of $2 million, the study says. To close the gap, the county would need to require a minimum 20% annual rate bump for five years. That’s an amount that some parents are willing to pay this year, instead of the full closure of the centers, and come 2026, those who decide to remain at their centers will have to start paying.

Miller is frustrated that the County Council hasn’t entertained any other solutions to keep the centers afloat. “They’re just focused on cutting it,” he said.
“They said, ‘You got two months. We’re closing at the end of the year. Good luck.’ And I was kind of just shocked, really, that they could just do that,” Miller said.
Since the closure decision, parents have been organizing, attending meetings at the county building, and collecting signatures for a petition to keep the centers open.
‘No’ as protest
Democratic council members voted against Republican council member Aimee Winder Newton’s proposal to extend the center’s time out of protest.
“I am grateful that hopefully the result of this vote will give families more time. I think this has been enormously stressful for families,” said council member Suzanne Harrison, a Democrat. “But I plan to vote no out of protest for there hasn’t been a good process to figure out solutions that would have been fiscally sustainable and viable to keep the programs open indefinitely or longer.”
That’s a sentiment Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson shared during the meeting.



Let us know what you think...


 


“I just want to be clear, my position is we should have taken the time necessary to make these day cares viable; look at market forces, indeed ask the families to pay more, set new terms if need be,” Wilson said.
Wilson also cautioned the council that the county’s administration is her role.
“I want to make sure that there’s coordination and understanding from the divisions and departments that work within this space, rather than council members leaning into an administrative role as we look at next steps,” Wilson said.
When the centers’ closure was put up for vote in late October, Republicans said that with $2 million dedicated to 270 kids a year, the county wasn’t being equitable. On Monday council chair Dea Theodore also referred to the nearly 20% tax increase Wilson proposed this year.
This is definitely extending some time for these families, and we do want to help them, too, with this process,” Theodore said. “But I also want to point out that this is due to a tax increase and some failures on the administration by letting it get to this point.”
The council also voted unanimously to work on an incentive for staff members to remain in place during the wind-down period.
​​Sharon Roux, the county’s human resources director said during the meeting “as we have a state licensure requirement, we have to have certain staffing ratios, and so it will be really critical for the viability of this program and to make it available through the end of May that we keep staff in place in order to do that.”
The uncertainty brought by the decision to close the day care centers with little notice has already taken a toll on employees, though, said council member Ross Romero. 
“Besides being a provider, we’re also an employer, and it really does feel like the employees’ voice was not considered very well in this decision to close these day cares,” Romero said, “so much so that we’ve had people already leave the county employment or looking to leave the county employment because of the uncertainty.”

(Photo by Jennifer Smith/CommonWealth Beacon)Massachusetts could render its 2030 climate commitments null and void under new sweeping legislation being fast-tracked by the House, according to a copy of the bill viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.
The measure, led by Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, would grant Massachusetts “immunity” should the state miss its target if the top environmental official in Massachusetts attributes that outcome to “the actions or inactions of the federal government.”
In such an instance, the state’s goal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels would become “advisory in nature and unenforceable.”
These changes to the state’s bedrock climate law, along with other major shifts in state climate policy like offshore wind procurements and energy efficiency funding, are currently under consideration by lawmakers on the House panel and could be quickly advanced.
Cusack is aiming to move the legislation out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19 after a poll of committee members closes on Wednesday. He says he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support to do just that, though a spokesperson for the speaker said he hasn’t yet taken an official position.
The bill leaves in place the state’s long-term goal of cutting emissions by 85 percent by 2050.
“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Cusack said in an interview. “This is a bill that saves significant money, real hard dollars, that people will see the impact of, while also dealing with the assault we’ve gone through,” he said, referring to moves by the Trump administration to roll back climate initiatives, “and planning for the future by not touching any mandates farther out. We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates, and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook.”
The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago. And it forces them to confront the drastic changes President Trump has made to Massachusetts’s efforts to transition to a clean energy economy, including stalled offshore wind permitting and revoked funding for solar energy and electric vehicles, as the onset of winter stokes residents’ anxiety over energy costs.
Cusack’s measure would cap the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, at $4 billion, marking a $500 million cut from its current budget as approved by the Department of Public Utilities.
The bill would even reduce the already-approved Mass Save budget by more than $300 million over the course of three years until 2027, with a focus on trimming the money that Mass Save spends on marketing and advertising. The program upgrades homes with heat pump installations and weatherization through a collaboration among the state’s utility companies, but it has become a contentious point in the state’s affordability debates because it is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on electric bills.
The legislation would similarly render Mass Save’s emissions reduction goals through 2030 — which are currently 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide under the program’s current three-year budget — as “advisory, non-binding, and non-enforceable.” Since buildings are the second-most polluting sector in Massachusetts, the Mass Save goals are a key part of the state’s strategy to meet the overall 2030 targets.
Mass Save delivered $2.8 billion in total benefits last year and has reduced annual electricity consumption dramatically, according to program data.
The bill would also push back the state’s statutory deadline to contract for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by two years, from 2027 to 2029, in order to respond to “uncertainty surrounding federal permitting” and “changing market conditions,” according to a bill summary.
The legislation represents Cusack’s overhaul of Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year, which contained none of these provisions. Cusack’s bill is moving as an entirely new measure outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint committee, Sen. Michael Barrett.
In order to become law, however, it would still need Senate approval – likely a long shot.
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.”
Still, the fact that such a measure appears to be advancing in the House is a sign of just how far the pendulum has swung on climate policy and a renewed sensitivity to the costs of clean power.
Healey didn’t directly address the House plan when asked at a press conference on Monday as her legislation devolves into a broader fight over climate goals.
“I haven’t seen the outlines of any specific plan on that,” she said, adding that she’s going to continue to work with the Legislature on her energy affordability bill. “There are other things in that legislation that will, right now, help us reduce energy costs. That’s what we’ve got to focus on,” Healey said.
The new measure from Cusack is bound to further upset climate advocates and progressives in Massachusetts, some of whom are already urging action in response.
Sierra Club Massachusetts, Mass Power Forward, and Progressive Mass have all mobilized their networks to contact state lawmakers just since Friday to express their opposition to the House bill.
The measure would also make reforms to various agencies and the utilities, including a proposal similar to Healey’s to expand the state’s ability to procure clean energy. That provision would set the Department of Energy Resources on a path to procure 10,000 megawatts of solar and 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.
DPU would also no longer be required to calculate the social value of greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating cost-effectiveness of the Mass Save program and other efforts to reduce energy demand.
And the legislation cuts the amount of clean energy that utilities must purchase in Massachusetts each year from a 3 percent annual increase to 1 percent until 2033.
On solar power, Cusack is also aiming to reduce net-metering compensation rates and raise a limit on municipal solar generation from 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, a cap that has been cause for concern for cities and towns around the state.
“These are hard savings coming back to the ratepayers here, and that’s what drove this bill,” Cusack said. “That was the number one goal from the onset and from my appointment [to this committee] and my charge from the Speaker and the rest of the House: How do we save people money? How do we lower our energy costs? How do we make sure that our energy costs aren’t a major hindrance to affordability of living, to doing business? And what does that mean long term for our economy, where we still want to be a hub of clean tech and clean energy and move away from fossil fuels?”

,DC,2025-11-10 23:48:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-battle-ebbs-trump-wont-give-trying-withhold-full-snap-benefits,,"The Trump administration continued Monday to press the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn lower court decisions requiring the federal government pay for full benefits for a major food program, even as Congress appeared to approach an end to the record-breaking government shutdown.Late Sunday, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Rhode Island federal judge’s order that the U.S. Department of Agriculture pay full November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.On Monday morning, the top federal litigator told the Supreme Court the administration was continuing its appeal.Later Monday, a Massachusetts federal judge kept in place an order canceling a Nov. 7 USDA memo to states over the weekend asking them to “undo” full November benefits, while chastising the administration for sowing confusion. The memo had left states unsure how to proceed, and some refused to obey it.President Donald Trump and top administration officials have resisted calls to fund November SNAP benefits during the shutdown that began Oct. 1. They argue that because Congress had not appropriated any money for the program for the fiscal year that began that date, USDA lacked the legal authority to make payments. That position was a reversal from the first Trump administration’s 2019 guidance and a shutdown plan the department published Sept. 30, then deleted, and has sparked several court challenges.About 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, use SNAP. Monday was the 41st day of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.Trump attorney seeks high court pauseIn an afternoon brief following his morning notice to the high court, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer largely repeated the argument he made in an initial appeal to the high court Nov. 7. Sauer said courts could not command the USDA to “raid” a fund for child nutrition programs that holds about $23 billion, so as to fund a roughly $4 billion shortfall for SNAP in the short term.He added Monday that the lower courts’ orders threaten to derail a deal in the Senate to reopen the government, expected to be completed this week.“Literally at the eleventh hour, those orders inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown,” Sauer wrote. “But the answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority. The only way to end this crisis—which the Executive is adamant to end—is for Congress to reopen the government.”Sauer’s brief came after Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ordered the government to say how it would proceed in light of the 1st Circuit order late Sunday and gave the coalition of nonprofit groups and municipal government that brought the original suit until 8 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday to respond.Massachusetts federal judge slams USDAAt an afternoon hearing in Massachusetts, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani denounced USDA’s Saturday night demand that states return authorized funding and maintained a temporary restraining order blocking it from going into effect.The Saturday night memo called on states to “immediately undo” actions to send benefits to people who use SNAP.But the states had been complying with a midday Nov. 7 memo from the same department official that instructed them to process full benefits in accordance with the Rhode Island order, Talwani said. “What you have right now is confusion of the agency's own making,” Talwani said.Keith Becker, who represented the administration in the hearing, said that guidance was meant to keep states from distributing benefits while the Supreme Court stay, issued late Nov. 7, was in place. Minnesota authorized benefits after the Supreme Court order, he said.Talwani said he had provided no evidence of that.Becker also said Wisconsin, Oregon and Michigan sent out benefits between the time of the Rhode Island order and the Nov. 7 guidance telling states to issue benefits, but Talwani said they were complying with the Rhode Island court order.The Saturday letter to states was inappropriate, she added.“It seems to me that the states acted fairly reasonably to follow your Nov. 7 guideline,” she said. “Even if there is a mistake here, the notion that the next move, on Saturday night, is a blustering order, that they're all going to be sued, and this thing and that thing — we're trying to get … benefits to people who need food.”She also said the administration appeared to be using Americans who use SNAP as political leverage, noting that even as the shutdown appears near its end, the administration was refusing to transfer reserve money from a fund that had enough to stay solvent into the spring.“You've chosen not to pay your benefits at this point, and it's hard to see how it's not just being used as a leverage point,” she said. “I understand that there's nice language about saying it’s for child nutrition, but it doesn't really ring true right now.”Appeals court rulingFederal courts have issued a flurry of rulings on the matter since groups, cities and Democratic states sued to force Trump to release November benefits late last month. The late Sunday ruling came from a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit, which upheld a Thursday order from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. that the government forfeited its option to issue partial November benefits when it missed a Nov. 5 deadline McConnell had set.USDA had argued that making partial SNAP payments, which it had never done before, would be difficult. But it made no plans to prepare those partial benefits nearly a month into the shutdown, Judge Julie Rikelman wrote in the panel’s opinion.“The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,” Rikelman wrote. “In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits.”The U.S. Senate is expected to vote Monday night on a bill to end the shutdown. The measure is likely to pass after advancing in a key procedural vote Sunday, but the House would still need to clear it and Trump would have to sign it before the government will reopen. House members have been told to begin returning to Washington.Sauer noted in his Monday letter that if the bill were to become law, the case would become moot.Dems blast court fightCongressional Democrats have been unsparing in their criticism of Trump’s efforts to keep from paying November benefits.U.S. House ranking Democrat Angie Craig of Minnesota said administration officials “simply do not care about America’s hungry children, veterans, seniors or people with disabilities.”“Instead of helping hungry seniors and children, President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins spent weeks illegally withholding food assistance from hungry Americans,” Craig said. “Now, they are again asking the Supreme Court to stop states from feeding hungry residents. The Trump administration would rather preserve its own sense of power than preserve the lives and wellbeing of hungry Americans.” Republicans have blamed Democrats for the lack of benefits payments, which they say could have been avoided if enough Senate Democrats voted with Republicans for a bill that would have temporarily reopened the government at current spending levels. California Democrat Adam Schiff “voted against funding SNAP 15 times,” the Senate GOP X account wrote in response to a tweet from Schiff. “If he wants to fund SNAP, he should join the eight other Democrats who have voted to reopen the government instead.All but three Senate Democrats voted against the measure in 14 consecutive votes. Most continued to oppose the 15th vote Sunday, but seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine voted with Republicans on the bill to reopen the government that also included three full-year spending bills and reinstated fired federal workers. Those votes gave Republicans the margin needed to bypass the Senate’s filibuster rule.",,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208

(Photo by Allan Swart/Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday again converted a temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a state law that requires displays of the Ten Commandments in public schools. 
The injunction applies to the Lakeside School District. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks allowed the Garland County district to be added as a defendant in the lawsuit and ordered the displays to be removed from its schools last month.
Arkansas Attorney Tim Griffin immediately appealed the decision to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Seven families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed the original lawsuit against four Northwest Arkansas school districts. They argued that Act 573 of 2025, which requires public schools to “prominently” display a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and libraries, was unconstitutional because it violated their First Amendment rights. 
Brooks agreed, and issued a preliminary injunction in August to block the law from being enforced in those four districts. The Conway School District was later added as a defendant in the case. Brooks issued a temporary restraining order against the Central Arkansas district, which he converted into a preliminary injunction in September.

In his two-page ruling Monday, Brooks noted that Lakeside was the only one of the school district defendants that filed a response opposing a motion for a preliminary injunction. The district adopted and incorporated arguments raised by the Conway School District, he said.
“The Court already explained why Conway’s arguments were either moot or nonsensical…and the same reasoning applies to Lakeside,” Brooks wrote. 
The state, which is being represented by Griffin, also submitted a brief urging the court to reconsider its decision to block the districts’ compliance with the new state law. However, Brooks said the state offered no new law to support its request. 
Additionally, Brooks said the Lakeside plaintiffs who were added to the case last month — Christine Benson and her minor child, B.B. — are similarly situated to all other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and the new state law is “likely to substantially interfere with her ability to direct the religious upbringing of her child and to violate their First Amendment rights.” 
“The Court also rejects the State’s request for a more tailored ‘bubble injunction’ that would apply only to B.B.’s classrooms; such tailoring would be infeasible, unworkable, and inadequate to completely relieve the injury to Ms. Benson’s and B.B.’s religious rights,” Brooks wrote. 
The converted preliminary injunction will remain effective “until this matter is decided on the merits,” according to Monday’s order.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — In 1981, then-Nebraska Gov. Charlie Thone was asked to submit three nominees to fill a vacancy on the state’s slice of the U.S. District Court.
His three nominees were “Arlen Beam, C.A. Beam and Clarence Arlen Beam.”
“He was my unanimous choice,” he told an interviewer later.
Beam ended up serving 38 years on the federal bench, eventually joining the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.
The judge died Oct. 31 at the age of 95.

Beam is remembered as having an ideal temperament for a judge who never forgot his small town upbringing in the Sandhills ranching town of Stapleton.
His pathway to the bench was unconventional. After graduating from the University of Nebraska in 1951 with an ROTC commission, he was called to serve in the Korean War.
At the time, any officer could represent an enlisted man in a court martial procedure. Beam’s first case ended in an acquittal, which he joked was his “first mistake,” because he got more and more cases referred to him, he said in an article eight years ago in the Nebraska Alumni Association magazine.
After learning that he loved practicing law and finishing his service in Korea, Beam enrolled at the NU School of Law in 1953. But the rigors of working full time to support his family, law school homework and his wife’s health problems became too much. He dropped out and took a job working for a seed corn company.
Ultimately, he returned to law school, graduating at age 35. Beam initially worked for the Lincoln law firm of Chambers, Holland & Dudgeon, which later became Knudsen, Berkheimer, Endacott & Beam.
He was active in Republican politics, serving as campaign director in 1964 for Barry Goldwater, and helped Thone as a legal advisor win the GOP’s nomination to become the party’s candidate for U.S. House of Representatives in 1970.
A former law colleague, Larry Ruth of Lincoln, said Beam taught him a lot about the art of lobbying and to use “an abundance of caution” by being thoroughly prepared for a case.
Beam grew up on a ranch, played 6-man football in Stapleton, which had a population of 350 then, and subscribed to the “Stapleton Enterprise” newspaper until his death.
“He never lost track of the fact that he was from Stapleton and that he learned a lot of things from Stapleton about what’s right and wrong and how to work,” Ruth said.
Thone, in the Nebraska Alumni Association article, told reporter Charlyne Berens that Beam had the ideal disposition to become a judge. Ruth said he never recalled hearing Beam raise his voice.
On the federal bench, Beam wrote more than 2,700 opinions, according to an obituary on Wyuka.com. The cases ranged from the Kansas City school district’s desegregation plan and a sexual harassment lawsuit involving then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton to the viability of federal laws that criminalized medical marijuana in California.
The judge took senior status in 2001, but continued to participate in rulings until retiring from the bench in 2020.
He and his wife of 74 years, Betty, raised five boys. She passed away in May.
A public memorial service for the judge and his wife is planned for noon on Nov. 21 at Eastridge Presbyterian Church, 1135 Eastridge Drive, in Lincoln. Burial will be private.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma again could see a push to open a religious charter school, with a Florida-based Jewish organization expressing intent to apply for state authorization.
If approved, Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School would operate as an online-based virtual charter school teaching Jewish religious studies and Oklahoma academic standards.
A previous attempt to open a publicly funded Catholic charter school in the state failed before the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. A deadlocked vote upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling against St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School.
Leading the effort is the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation, which has opened six non-religious Hebrew-English charter schools in Florida. 
Peter Deutsch, a former Democratic U.S. representative and the founder of Ben Gamla schools, submitted a letter of intent on Nov. 3 to apply for charter authorization with the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board. A formal application has not yet been submitted for the school, and the board cannot take a vote until that happens.
“Ben Gamla envisions Oklahoma students gaining a rigorous, values-based education that integrates general academic excellence with Jewish religious learning and ethical development,” Deutsch wrote.

The Statewide Charter School Board backed local Catholic leaders’ attempt to open a religious, taxpayer-funded school. In 2023, a previous version of the board, which at the time focused solely on virtual charter schools, cast the landmark vote to approve St. Isidore’s founding application. The school quickly became entangled in multiple lawsuits and never opened its doors.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa have ended their pursuit of charter-school funding and are now opening a private online school called St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy. 
Brett Farley, a member of St. Isidore’s board of directors, is listed in Deutsch’s letter as part of the Oklahoma Jewish school’s founding team. He declined to comment Monday.
The school’s founders are aiming to open with 40 students by the 2026-27 academic year, according to Deutsch’s letter. The state board, though, typically requires at least 18 months of preparation between the date a charter’s application was submitted and its first day of school.
Board chairperson Brian Shellem said he hasn’t yet read Deutsch’s letter of intent, but he didn’t dismiss the idea of another religious charter applicant.
“We’re going to consider their application,” Shellem said. “I think we need to give everyone an unbiased approach. Before we look at their (letter of intent), before we look at their application, I’m not going to prejudge something. I haven’t seen it.”

The Catholic charter school had staunch support from Gov. Kevin Stitt and other state leaders, who said it would expand quality education options for Oklahoma families. St. Isidore would have been the first charter school in the nation to advocate for a particular religion while relying chiefly on taxpayer funds. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond led the legal fight against the school, contending it would “eviscerate” constitutional church-state separation.
“This matter has already been resolved after the state Supreme Court’s ruling to prevent taxpayer funded religious charter schools was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year,” Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for the attorney general, said Monday. “Our office will oppose any attempts to undermine the rule of law.”
Including the Ben Gamla school, the Statewide Charter School Board received eight letters of intent from potential applicants this year, an unusually high number that executive director Rebecca Wilkinson said is an “anomaly.” None but the Jewish school indicated they would adopt a religion.
Two applications have already been submitted — one from Southwest Academy Charter School and another from Tempo Montessori Charter School. 
The board has 90 days after receiving an application to consider it. Shellem said votes on Southwest Academy and Tempo Montessori are “more than likely not” happening until 2026.
Moore Public Schools has already rejected Southwest Academy’s application to open with a classical-education-inspired curriculum. That rejection is a necessary step before a brick-and-mortar charter can apply at the state level. Virtual charter schools can apply directly to the state board.
Southwest Academy’s board president, Angie Ritter, said the school’s projected enrollment is 160 students in pre-K through second grade starting in August 2027. The founders are in lease negotiations with Regency Park Baptist Church for a school location, she said.

The charter academy would create another option for Moore parents who are priced out of private education and are unable to homeschool, Ritter said in a presentation to the state board.
“We believe that we can meet this need head-on by removing all of the financial barriers that would be there for parents and give them a high-quality option that’s tuition free,” she said.
Tempo Montessori would operate within the district boundaries of Union Public Schools in Tulsa. Union’s school board rejected its charter application on Oct. 20.
Tempo’s founding executive director Diane Beckham established the state’s first public Montessori school at Emerson Elementary in Tulsa Public Schools. She and TPS later opened two more programs within the district with the hands-on, student-led style of Montessori instruction. 
Opening a charter school would grant greater flexibility than operating as part of a school district, Beckham told the Statewide Charter School Board in a presentation Monday.
Every child learns at his or her own pace, she said, hence the name Tempo. 
The school is preparing to operate out of Destiny Church in Broken Arrow with a year-round calendar, featuring no breaks longer than four weeks. Beckham projected a year-one enrollment of 150 students in pre-K, kindergarten and sixth grade.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 23:41:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Swelling CT revenues could intensify response to federal cuts,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/swelling-ct-revenues-could-intensify-response-to-federal-cuts/,The CT revenue projections — about $1.1 billion in extra revenue this fiscal year — likely will expand calls for more state tax cuts.,"Already anticipating huge surpluses this budget cycle and next, Connecticut’s coffers will swell even more, state analysts projected Monday, thanks to surging income and business tax receipts tied to a robust stock market in 2025.
The swelling projections — about $1.1 billion in extra revenue this fiscal year and an average of $500 million more in each of the next two — likely will expand calls for further state tax cuts and greater investments in human service programs to assist Connecticut households strained by tightening federal budget policies.
“Today’s consensus revenue forecast shows continued economic growth in Connecticut for families and businesses alike,” Gov. Ned Lamont said late Monday after his budget staff and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis released their first joint revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The two agencies will revise those projections twice more before the budget year ends June 30, on Jan. 15 and on April 30.
The new report does show that federal cuts to the corporate tax rate effectively will cost Connecticut hundreds of millions in state receipts from major companies over the coming years. But that will be more than offset by Wall Street, and by steadier and less flashy growth in sales tax receipts and income tax payments from wages and general earnings.
“While our state’s economy will always be influenced by external factors,” Lamont added, “we in Connecticut are staying on the right track where we can control our future.”
Analysts: Revenues grow through the 2020s
At first glance, Connecticut’s budget is taking a hit this fiscal year.
The General Fund, which represents about 90% of the $27.2 billion overall state budget and covers most operating expenses, will collect $135 million less than analysts had projected. The fund, previous projected to finish $322 million in the black, now should have about $190 million left over.
President Donald Trump and Congress adopted a broad series of household and corporate income tax reductions last July, paying for a portion of them with deep cuts to Medicaid and other human service programs.
And because Connecticut links its corporate tax system to the federal code — as do several other states — analysts say those changes will cost Connecticut more than $100 million, on average, across this fiscal year and the next two.
But just outside the formal budget, there is good news that overwhelms the bad.
Since 2017, Connecticut has used a special savings program that captures much of its income and business tax receipts linked to investment earnings before they even arrive in the formal budget, so legislators cannot spend them.
And the forecast released Monday says this category will generate almost $1.1 billion more than expected this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday up almost 7% for 2025. The Standard and Poor’s 500, another key market index, closed up almost 14% for the year.
Given that projected savings and the General Fund’s estimated operating balance, Connecticut now expects to close its books June 30 with about $2 billion unspent, one of the largest surpluses in state history and greater than the $1.8 billion cushion the state has averaged since 2017, when aggressive new budget caps were established.
Analysts also boosted their expectations for total state revenues by more than $650 million next fiscal year and by another $350 million in 2027-28.
CT lawmakers eye tax relief, more state services, to counter federal cuts
Majority Democrats in the General Assembly have become increasingly critical of these surpluses, which have been used chiefly to build reserves and reduce Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
Many Democratic lawmakers and progressive organizations argue the savings program is excessive and should be scaled back some to restore more funds for education, health care, municipal aid and other core services.
“These [revenue] numbers show what our coalition has been saying for years: our problem in Connecticut is the lack of political will to spend the money we already have. It’s time for our governor and his budget team to put families first and reconsider the fiscal roadblocks so we can stop hoarding money and start responding to the needs in our communities, which get worse every year,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has been one of the budget cap’s chief defenders, often teaming with minority Republicans to argue they should be changed little or not at all.
Many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority argue it’s excessive, pulling too much revenue from education, health care and other core services.
But while the GOP has been wary to ease budget caps to increase spending, more Republicans are talking about saving less — if it means Connecticut can finance more state tax cuts.
House Republicans last month proposed what would amount to one of the largest state income tax cuts in Connecticut history.
The GOP wants to boost an income tax credit that offsets a portion of middle-class households’ municipal property tax bill from a maximum of $300 to as much as $1,000. The initiative would cost the state, Republicans estimate, about $500 million per year.
“We need property tax relief, and our caucus stands by that,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Monday, adding that Republicans will push hard for this when the regular 2026 legislative session opens Feb. 4. “Our property taxes have been squeezed to the bone, and people cannot pay the levels they’ve been required to pay to maintain public services.”
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said Monday she expects lawmakers from both parties will seek state tax relief to help Connecticut households hurt by federal cuts to human service programs.
“I’m sure there will be” bipartisan interest, she said, “particularly given the volatility at the federal level and what we anticipate to be pretty massive costs inflicted on us by federal policies. Our [budget caps] will be under pressure.”
Many legislators also are expected to call for greater state spending as well, though, in the coming years, with a particular focus on Medicaid, a massive health care program that faces deep federal cuts in 2027 and 2028.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208

This story was originally by The 19th.
The Supreme Court will not hear a case to overturn marriage equality, it announced on Monday. The justices have rejected a petition from Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue licenses in the state a decade ago.
Davis’ petition has been closely watched, but was seen as a long shot.
For the past decade, Davis  has been battling against giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She was jailed for six days and fined $100,000 plus attorney’s fees for refusing to do so.
It is the second time Davis petitioned the court to hear her case. She made similar arguments five years ago, and the court also declined to take up the case then.
“Davis possesses a sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,” her petition to the high court stated.
She was largely viewed as one of few Americans with legal standing to challenge the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that made marriage equality the law of the land.  But LGBTQ+ legal scholars have stated that her legal standing was still shaky and that the foundation for marriage equality remains strong.
Still, Kevin Jennings, CEO of Lambda Legal, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ legal organization said in a statement that now is not a time for LGBTQ+ advocates to let their guard down.
“This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history,” Jennings said. “But let’s not be naïve: our opponents are well-resourced and determined.”
A majority of Americans would lose access to marriage equality if Obergefell  was overturned; 35 states have either a constitutional ban on marriage equality or a statute prohibiting LGBTQ+ couples from marrying. Some have both.
However, in 2022, Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act, a law that forces states to recognize out-of-state marriages and that grandfathers pre-existing same-sex marriages into law. As a result, married LGBTQ+ couples would remain married and couples wanting to get married could do so by traveling to other states that allow marriage equality.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LGBT-1024x679-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-10 23:40:03+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,House moves forward with bill to weaken 2030 climate goals,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/house-moves-forward-with-bill-to-weaken-2030-climate-goals/,"The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago.","MASSACHUSETTS COULD RENDER its 2030 climate commitments null and void under new sweeping legislation being fast-tracked by the House, according to a copy of the bill viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
The measure, led by Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, would grant Massachusetts “immunity” should the state miss its target if the top environmental official in Massachusetts attributes that outcome to “the actions or inactions of the federal government.” 
In such an instance, the state’s goal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels would become “advisory in nature and unenforceable.” 
These changes to the state’s bedrock climate law, along with other major shifts in state climate policy like offshore wind procurements and energy efficiency funding, are currently under consideration by lawmakers on the House panel and could be quickly advanced. 
Cusack is aiming to move the legislation out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19 after a poll of committee members closes on Wednesday. He says he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support to do just that, though a spokesperson for the speaker said he hasn’t yet taken an official position. 
The bill leaves in place the state’s long-term goal of cutting emissions by 85 percent by 2050. 
“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Cusack said in an interview. “This is a bill that saves significant money, real hard dollars, that people will see the impact of, while also dealing with the assault we’ve gone through,” he said, referring to moves by the Trump administration to roll back climate initiatives, “and planning for the future by not touching any mandates farther out. We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates, and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook.” 
The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago. And it forces them to confront the drastic changes President Trump has made to Massachusetts’s efforts to transition to a clean energy economy, including stalled offshore wind permitting and revoked funding for solar energy and electric vehicles, as the onset of winter stokes residents’ anxiety over energy costs. 
Cusack’s measure would cap the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, at $4 billion, marking a $500 million cut from its current budget as approved by the Department of Public Utilities.  
The bill would even reduce the already-approved Mass Save budget by more than $300 million over the course of three years until 2027, with a focus on trimming the money that Mass Save spends on marketing and advertising. The program upgrades homes with heat pump installations and weatherization through a collaboration among the state’s utility companies, but it has become a contentious point in the state’s affordability debates because it is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on electric bills.  
The legislation would similarly render Mass Save’s emissions reduction goals through 2030 — which are currently 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide under the program’s current three-year budget — as “advisory, non-binding, and non-enforceable.” Since buildings are the second-most polluting sector in Massachusetts, the Mass Save goals are a key part of the state’s strategy to meet the overall 2030 targets. 
Mass Save delivered $2.8 billion in total benefits last year and has reduced annual electricity consumption dramatically, according to program data. 
The bill would also push back the state’s statutory deadline to contract for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by two years, from 2027 to 2029, in order to respond to “uncertainty surrounding federal permitting” and “changing market conditions,” according to a bill summary. 
The legislation represents Cusack’s overhaul of Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year, which contained none of these provisions. Cusack’s bill is moving as an entirely new measure outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint committee, Sen. Michael Barrett.  
In order to become law, however, it would still need Senate approval – likely a long shot.  
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.” 
Still, the fact that such a measure appears to be advancing in the House is a sign of just how far the pendulum has swung on climate policy and a renewed sensitivity to the costs of clean power.  
Healey didn’t directly address the House plan when asked at a press conference on Monday as her legislation devolves into a broader fight over climate goals. 
“I haven’t seen the outlines of any specific plan on that,” she said, adding that she’s going to continue to work with the Legislature on her energy affordability bill. “There are other things in that legislation that will, right now, help us reduce energy costs. That’s what we’ve got to focus on.”  
The new measure from Cusack is bound to further upset climate advocates and progressives in Massachusetts, some of whom are already urging action in response.  
Sierra Club Massachusetts, Mass Power Forward, and Progressive Mass have all mobilized their networks to contact state lawmakers just since Friday to express their opposition to the House bill.  
The measure would also make reforms to various agencies and the utilities, including a proposal similar to Healey’s to expand the state’s ability to procure clean energy. That provision would set the Department of Energy Resources on a path to procure 10,000 megawatts of solar and 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.  
DPU would also no longer be required to calculate the social value of greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating cost-effectiveness of the Mass Save program and other efforts to reduce energy demand.  
And the legislation cuts the amount of clean energy that utilities must purchase in Massachusetts each year from a 3 percent annual increase to 1 percent until 2033.  
On solar power, Cusack is also aiming to reduce net-metering compensation rates and raise a limit on municipal solar generation from 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, a cap that has been cause for concern for cities and towns around the state.  
“These are hard savings coming back to the ratepayers here, and that’s what drove this bill,” Cusack said. “That was the number one goal from the onset and from my appointment [to this committee] and my charge from the Speaker and the rest of the House: How do we save people money? How do we lower our energy costs? How do we make sure that our energy costs aren’t a major hindrance to affordability of living, to doing business? And what does that mean long term for our economy, where we still want to be a hub of clean tech and clean energy and move away from fossil fuels?”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6282-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;quality=89&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)KEOSAUQUA — Before heading back to Washington, D.C., to vote on a measure to end the government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks faced a fiery crowd Monday at a town hall in Keosauqua.
Members of the audience yelled as the Republican representative spoke about her support of Medicaid changes made in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. She also discussed her position on Democrats’ calls to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits.
The event came as the U.S. Senate moved Monday toward approving stopgap funding measures to reopen the government until Jan. 30, approaching the end of the longest shutdown in national history. Senate Democrats had refused to advance stopgap spending bills if enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at the end of the year, were not extended. On Sunday, seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to advance a continuing resolution that did not include language on the ACA tax credits, though Republican leadership has promised a future vote will be held on the issue.
Regardless of the Senate’s action, the continuing resolution to end the shutdown must also get House approval before heading to President Donald Trump. Miller-Meeks told the crowd in Keosauqua she would be heading back to Washington, D.C., to vote on the measure following the town hall.
“As a matter of fact, just a few hours ago, we were on a conference call with Speaker (Mike) Johnson and he wants us to return to D.C. now,” Miller-Meeks said. “I wasn’t going to cancel this town hall. So we’ve committed to doing this, and then we’ll head back to D.C. and hopefully, as early as possible, it’ll be on Wednesday that we would have a vote on funding the government.”
Democrats’ criticize lack of public forums
Democrats have criticized Miller-Meeks for saying at a Johnson County Republicans of Iowa meeting in August she would hold public town halls “when hell freezes over.” While Miller-Meeks has held town halls remotely in recent weeks, including a telephone town hall Oct. 15 with 10,700 participants, the Keosauqua event was her first in-person public town hall this year.
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement Miller-Meeks’ town hall shows that she is not committed to being easily accessible to her constituents.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Iowans she won’t do her job until hell freezes over,” Smith said in a statement. “That’s the kind of representation Iowans have come to expect from Miller-Meeks: the rare instances she does show up, it’s paying meaningless lip service to Iowans while making it as difficult as possible for them to see her in public and hold her accountable.”
House GOP campaign officials told members of the caucus earlier in the year to avoid hosting in-person town halls, as Republican members of Congress across the country have faced angry crowds at public meetings who are upset with cuts to public programs like SNAP and Medicaid as well as actions taken by the Trump administration. Iowa’s U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst gained national attention for saying, “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall when a woman shouted that people will die because of the Medicaid cuts made in the budget reconciliation law.
Health care debate contentious
Dissatisfaction with Republican policies on health care were also a major point of contention at the Monday town hall. Kadie Johansson, the general manager of KILJ Radio, moderated the event, reading questions written down by Iowa 1st Congressional District residents, which included several questions about Medicaid.
The audience cheered when Johansson read a question asking, “Why did you allow your committee to put in place the largest cuts to Medicaid in the program’s entire history?” Miller-Meeks responded by thanking the crowd for cheering for the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee’s vote to “strengthen and preserve Medicaid” through implementing work requirements and removing coverage for immigrants who lack legal residency status and ineligible people.
Congressional Budget Office estimates found the changes to Medicaid made in the budget reconciliation bill will reduce spending on the program by $625 billion over 10 years. Miller-Meeks said current spending on the program is “unsustainable,” and that the changes are a way to ensure the health coverage program’s continued existence to provide health care for “those who Medicaid was intended for: children, pregnant women, those with disabilities and those seniors or veterans who are dual-eligible.”
Another question raised reports that health care premiums will double for people covered through Health Insurance Marketplaces unless the enhanced tax credits are extended.
Miller-Meeks said there was misinformation circulating about Democrats’ calls to extend these ACA tax credits, saying the subsidies in question were put in place to assist health insurance companies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“What expired was COVID-era enhanced premium tax cuts, where that money goes directly to profitable insurance companies,” Miller-Meeks said. “It was a corporate welfare bailout to the health insurance companies done by the Democrats in 2021. … They were then redone in 2022 through the (Inflation Reduction Act). Those are enhanced premium tax credits. It’s minimal number of people … the ACA premium tax credits were not changed. That’s in the regular appropriation process.”
She said Republicans have lowered costs for people in need through the increased tax subsidies for children and senior citizens through the budget reconciliation bill, but said the ACA subsidies were unchanged in the GOP spending plan.
At an October fundraiser, Miller-Meeks told supporters that she did not support Democrats’ shutdown demands on extending the tax credits after they lost control of both chambers of Congress in the 2024 election.
“I don’t like Democrats shutting down the government over something that they could not get done when they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and now they expect us to do their job for them,” Miller-Meeks said in October. “They expect us to extend something that they couldn’t do themselves.”
Other questions focused on Trump and his administration’s policies, with several constituents saying the president’s tariff policies have negatively impacted Iowa farmers. The Iowa Republican said she believes tariffs “can be a negotiating tool,” and said she believes many of the issues farmers are facing are due to high input costs, which she said “occurred when we had record-high inflation under the Biden administration.” She also emphasized there has not been a vote on tariffs in the House.
Additionally, there were multiple questions with calls for Miller-Meeks to support the release of the “Epstein files,” or Department of Justice information on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Miller-Meeks said she supports releasing information on Epstein, but said there needs to be a larger focus on protecting Epstein’s victims in these discussions.
The race for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is expected to be one of the most competitive in the nation in 2026, with political forecasters like Cook Political Report rating the race as a “toss-up.” Miller-Meeks has won reelection with tight margins in recent election cycles, winning against Democrat Christina Bohannan in 2024 by less than 800 votes. She won her first election to the U.S. House in 2020 by just six votes.
Bohannan is running again to challenge Miller-Meeks in 2026. There are also two other Democrats competing to become the candidate to face her in the general election — Travis Terrell and Taylor Wettach. Republican David Pautsch, who also ran for the seat in 2024, is running a primary campaign against Miller-Meeks in the upcoming election.

Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is set to leave the Tennessee legislature after two terms.
Hemmer, who represents District 59 in southern Davidson County, announced Monday he will not seek a third two-year term in 2026.
A healthcare executive, Hemmer said he wants to spend more time with his two children and wife and meet work commitments as well.
Hemmer passed bills dealing with maternal health, university-sponsored lab schools, affordable housing and children’s mental health.
“These were all promises I made during my campaign, and I’ve stayed focused on delivering real legislation that makes a real difference in the lives of Tennesseans,” he said in a statement.
Hemmer made some noise as a lawmaker when he filed an ethics complaint against Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds for allowing ExcelinEd, a pro-charter and pro-voucher group that previously employed her, to pay for two out-of-state conferences.
The Tennessee Ethics Commission dismissed the complaint, mainly because she paid back more than $2,000 to the organization. She was later reimbursed by the state.
Acceptance of such a gift from groups that hire lobbyists is a violation of state law and an order by Gov. Bill Lee. The governor also ran afoul of state ethics laws by allowing Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based conservative Christian group, to fund his expenses to speak at a summer conference in South Florida. The group used a state lobbyist to push bills, but Lee refused to repay the money because it had a 501(c)3 nonprofit tax designation.
In Hemmer’s parting statement, he urged constituents to continue holding elected officials “to the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.”

“They [the federal government] want that money back — they’re not getting it back,” Evers said in a short news conference at a La Crosse food bank. “It’s for the people that are part of this program.”
The Evers administration moved swiftly Thursday evening to funnel $104.4 million to Wisconsin’s FoodShare program after a federal court ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fully fund November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments.
Wisconsin FoodShare participants spent $9.9 million of the benefits on groceries Friday, according to the Evers administration.
By Monday, however, the administration said that it was lacking sufficient SNAP funds to reimburse retailers after the U.S. Treasury blocked the federal benefits payment to Wisconsin on Friday.
USDA said it would fully fund November’s SNAP payments in response to Thursday’s court order. Instead, however, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the order and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it on hold for 48 hours.
On Saturday the Trump administration directed states to return a portion of their SNAP funds to the federal government.
“No,” Evers declared in response.
On Monday, Wisconsin joined more than two dozen states in a motion filed in federal court in Massachusetts to block the Trump administration’s Saturday directive.
The directive “underscores the arbitrary and capricious nature of their conduct in this matter and demonstrates the need for immediate relief,” the motion states. “USDA must make full benefits available to SNAP beneficiaries without delay, and the November 8 guidance should be enjoined.”
A federal judge temporarily blocked the directive Monday, Reuters reported.
On Monday afternoon, Evers toured WAFER Food Pantry in La Crosse, where he spoke with reporters about USDA’s order to states to pull back funds pushed out to electronic benefit cards used by SNAP recipients, including FoodShare users in Wisconsin.
“That’s embarrassing. That’s embarrassing for any president of the United States,” said Evers in a news conference that was televised on CSPAN.
“He [Trump] can claw all he wants,” Evers said. “It’s not going to happen. They have no authority to do that.”
Evers said that grocery stores should not have to wait for FoodShare funds that they are due when customers make purchases on their electronic benefits cards. “They should be getting reimbursed like they always have,” he said.
The state Department of Health Services and the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection both issued statements Monday warning retailers and grocery stores that are part of the FoodShare program that they cannot reject customers with funds legally loaded onto their QUEST benefit cards, and businesses cannot turn away people using the cards.
“While there haven’t been reports of people being turned away or of price gouging thus far, we want to make sure everyone is clear on the expectations. No one in Wisconsin should have to worry about their next meal,” said DATCP Secretary Randy Romanski.
Evers signed an anti-price-gouging order on Oct. 31.
In a letter Sunday to Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, Evers called the administration’s clawback attempt “a shocking and disturbing request—and one that should be condemned by every person, regardless of their political beliefs or party.”
Evers noted that the state’s three Democratic federal lawmakers have spoken up in opposition to the administration’s actions.
“I find it deeply troubling the rest of you have failed to do so,” he wrote, referring to Wisconsin’s seven Republican Congress members, “and I implore you to change that today.”

A slew of state lawmakers shared their perspectives on the next state budget and other topics ranging from energy policy to transportation at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce’s conference that served as a preview of the upcoming legislative session in 2026.
Lawmakers will meet at the start of next year to craft a two-year state budget consisting of more than $100 billion that funds local school districts, state agencies and covers a portion of costs for federal programs including Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people and other qualifying recipients.  
State governments including Kentucky will also have to grapple with significant costs shifted to them by Congress for large federal assistance programs — namely Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer. 
“It will impact the way we do the budget,” said Kentucky House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, speaking before the crowd of business interests. “I think this budget is going to present some unique challenges because there really are disparate ideas on how we approach this budget.” 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act shifted more administration costs to states for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides nearly 593,000 low-income Kentuckians with funding to buy food. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act also changed how much cost-share states cover for SNAP depending on how often a state makes an error in determining SNAP benefits for a recipient. 
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, the chair of the Kentucky Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, told the crowd the increased SNAP costs would amount to an immediate $180 million “hit” to the state budget, also mentioning there would be “additional things” to address related to Medicaid in the future.
The Congressional Budget Office projected the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce federal spending on Medicaid over a decade by $911 billion and increase the number of uninsured people by about 10 million. The National Conference of State Legislatures wrote that the decreased Medicaid spending is largely attributed to stricter eligibility for Medicaid — such as adding work requirements — and limiting the use of provider taxes that states use to cover their share of Medicaid costs. 
But McDaniel was clear the state legislature wouldn’t be a backstop for programs “negatively impacted” by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
“Rethink your strategy,” McDaniel said. “The state is not going to backfill federal programs that get changed. It’s just not going to happen. We simply do not have the bandwidth or the financial wherewithal to do so.”

Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, the chair of the Kentucky House Postsecondary Education Committee, said during the conference the legislature had to be ready “if change does come” in regards to education funding. Federal education budget proposals from the White House and U.S. House Republicans call for deep cuts to funding for the nation’s K-12 schools.
One lawmaker also brought up looming financial questions facing Kentucky hospitals with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, particularly the law limiting state taxes on health care providers that hospitals rely on to get better reimbursement rates for treating Medicaid patients. 
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, the chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, mentioned to the crowd an assessment from the Kentucky Hospital Association that 35 hospitals in the state could close with the planned scale-down of provider taxes that hospitals rely on. Meredith told the Lantern he believed Congress would ultimately make changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
“I think our congressmen and women will say, ‘We’ve got to put a stop to this or make some adjustments,’” said Meredith, a former hospital CEO. “We can’t let 35 hospitals close. So something will happen.” 
State funding uncertainty
State lawmakers during the one-day conference also alluded to facing a tighter budget in the next year as a result of uncertainty in state revenue in part triggered by federal trade policy under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a group of economists charged with creating state government revenue forecasts, during its last meeting in September projected state revenues would fall over $300 million short of what is budgeted for the new fiscal year that began in July. That projected shortfall amounted to about a 2% decrease of the more than $15 billion budget for the fiscal year. The chairman of the forecasting group cited uncertainty with tariffs and trade for the revised revenue projection, though Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear also noted the decreases in income tax revenue. 
The group will meet again in December to revisit its revenue projection for the current fiscal year and also project revenue for the upcoming two-year state budget to be considered by the legislature in 2026. 
A significant question facing lawmakers regarding state revenues is what to do with the state’s income tax rate, something that the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and GOP leadership want to eventually eliminate. 
Osborne said there are “disparate” ideas on how to approach the state’s income tax rate this year and how much to spend from the billions of dollars in the state’s “rainy day” fund. 
The GOP-controlled legislature, through a landmark law passed in 2022, created a system of fiscal triggers related to state revenues and the state’s “rainy day” fund before it can lower the state’s income tax rate by a half percentage point.

It’s a shared goal of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and GOP legislators to eliminate the state’s income tax rate, though the state failed to meet the system’s fiscal triggers this year to lower the income tax rate by another half percentage point in 2027. Fiscal triggers were hit last year, allowing the state income tax rate to drop 3.5% at the start of next year. The legislature changed the fiscal trigger system in this year’s legislative session to allow lawmakers to potentially reduce the income tax rate by less than a half percentage point. 
House Majority Floor Whip Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, argued on a panel with McDaniel that the legislature had actually met the fiscal triggers to reduce the income tax rate by another half percentage point in 2027. He asserted the timing was off for when revenue amounts were checked, arguing that not all state revenues had been accounted for. 
Osborne said it was the state budget director’s opinion that the fiscal triggers were not met. But he also said “we can make policy however we want to make it.” 
“There’s going to be conversations around this budget we haven’t had in the last several years that I think are going to be pretty interesting,” Osborne said. “Not necessarily disagreements or fights, but just different philosophies.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images)Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay dismissed a lawsuit Monday that questioned whether Gov. Patrick Morrisey acted lawfully when he sent members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C. earlier this year at the request of President Donald Trump.
The case was brought against the state by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the state Citizen Action Group. On Monday, Lindsay dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning it could be refiled if circumstances change. 
The ACLU and CAG were requesting Lindsay to issue a preliminary injunction that would have brought the West Virginia National Guard out of D.C. and sent back home. Since the court found that the deployment was lawful, no preliminary injunction was issued. 
Moreover, Lindsay said he was “persuaded” by arguments from Chris Etheredge, a lawyer with the Attorney General’s Office representing the state, to dismiss the case.
In general, Lindsay ruled that because Trump did request states to send their National Guard members to D.C., standards were met that made the deployment legal. The situation would have likely been different, he said, if the troops were sent to another state without the request and consent of that state’s governor.
“If the matter before this court was the deployment of our National Guard to another state over the objection of a state governor, then this court would have a problem with it,” Lindsay said. “[But] this case truly is different than every other National Guard deployment that’s been in the news over the last year. It’s an important fact to the extent that the president was acting within his authority according to local law [and federal law].”
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Monday was the third hearing held in the now-dismissed case. Lindsay said that, since the court found that the governor’s actions were legal, there was no further litigation necessary to prove alleged harm against CAG.
In their lawsuit, the ACLU argued that CAG was suffering real harm due to the National Guard deployment because staff were forced to use more time and resources to both educate the public about it and ensure the government acted properly. 
Etheredge argued in an earlier hearing that these alleged harms against CAG were not real and were not clear. He previously argued that the only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” by the ongoing deployment are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Billy Wolfe, communications director for the ACLU, said in a statement Monday that the organization was “disappointed” in Lindsay’s ruling but was also “thankful that the court treated the issue with the attention it deserved.”
“The court was clear that [CAG] had a right to hold the government accountable, and that the governor’s authority to deploy the Guard is not absolute,” Wolfe wrote. “We’re going to keep an eye on this important issue.”

Trump issued a pardon for Jones, a longtime supporter, and others involved in a plan to overturn the 2020 election. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Republicans who came under legal scrutiny after allegedly playing a role in trying to overturn President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss are celebrating after the president issued a sweeping preemptive pardon – though the presidential decree will have no direct effect on the languishing state racketeering case out of Fulton County.
In a proclamation, Trump said the pardons will end “a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election.” The pardons were issued Friday but announced Monday by a Justice Department official.
The document broadly applies to any U.S. citizen for activity related to schemes to create “alternate” slates of electors in attempts to certify a Trump victory in states where he lost, or for efforts to expose “voting fraud and vulnerabilities” in that year’s presidential election.
After losing in 2020, Trump undertook an unprecedented effort to overturn the election, and he continues to maintain without evidence that the election was rigged.
Fulton defendants
The pardon specifically names each of Trump’s 18 alleged co-conspirators in the 2023 case brought by the Fulton County District Attorney, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and fellow Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro.
The defendants are accused of participating in a conspiracy to overturn the election results, including by casting fake electoral votes, convincing state officials to falsify results and pressuring Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman to falsely state that she witnessed ballot fraud.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis accused Trevian Kutti, a former publicist for celebrities including rapper Kanye West, of trying to frighten Freeman into casting doubt on Fulton County’s election system. Kutti celebrated receiving the pardon on Instagram Monday with a post featuring West’s song “Praise God.”
“WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH PARDON FROM THE PRESIDENT. STILL UP ON TOP. THE DEVIL IS MY OPP. CAN’T PAY ME TO STOP! MY GOD AT THE TOP! THANK YOU @realdonaldtrump,” wrote Kutti, whose bio includes the phrase “I BEAT FANI WILLIS.”
Willis accused Jeffrey Clark, now a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget, of trying to overturn election results in 2020 when he was serving as acting assistant attorney general, including by falsely stating that the U.S. Department of Justice had “significant concerns” with the elections in Georgia and other states.
In July, a Washington disciplinary panel recommended Clark be disbarred.
In a statement on social media, Clark said he was surprised by the pardon but “deeply grateful” to Trump for giving it, even though it’s not likely to end his legal woes.
“I’m thankful to the Lord, President Trump, friends, and donors,” Clark said on social media. “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good—a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others. Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”
Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University, called the pardon “an affront to democracy” for those who believe Trump and his allies tried to overturn the election, but he added that the case also illustrates the importance of state prosecutors in cases involving an allegation of a scheme to overturn a presidential election.
“Because a president enjoys sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution and because the president can provide pardons for federal crime, state prosecutors can be the best last option to deter presidential election fraud or secure accountability for those who assist a president in trying to hold onto power after they lose a re-election campaign,” he said.

But the Fulton case is far from solid ground at the moment.
After Willis was pulled off the case because of a “significant appearance of impropriety,” stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a special prosecutor she hired, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee tasked Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council, with appointing a new prosecutor.
The deadline for that appointment is Friday, and if none is found, McAfee will dismiss the entire indictment.
The search for a replacement continues, Skandalakis said in a statement Monday.
“My staff and I have been diligently working on this matter since the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the disqualification of the District Attorney’s Office,” he said. “We will continue to carry out our responsibilities without being influenced by matters outside the scope of our assigned task, with the goal of complying fully with Judge McAfee’s order.”
Alternate electors

Trump’s pardon also specifically names so-called alternate electors from several states, including 16 from Georgia who met in the state Capitol in December 2020 to sign false certificates stating that Trump won and send them to Washington. Three alternate electors were also charged in the Fulton County election interference case: former Coffee County GOP chair Cathy Latham, former Georgia GOP chief David Shafer and state Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican who was recently named Senate GOP caucus chair.
Georgia’s highest-ranking alternate elector is Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who participated in the plan while serving as a state senator. A special prosecutor ruled last year that Jones acted within the scope of his authority as a state legislator and that charges should not be brought against him. Trump has endorsed Jones in the 2026 race for governor in Georgia.
In a statement following the pardon, campaign spokesperson Kayla Lott characterized the case against Jones as political theater from Willis.
“After being cleared by the state prosecutor, this is the final confirmation that this whole thing was a charade led by Joe Biden and Fani Willis,” Lott said. “They owe the taxpayers an apology and a refund.”

Tracy Pennychuick (R-Montgomery) introduces her bill at a committee hearing in Trappe on Nov. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)A two-hour state Senate committee hearing explored the use of artificial intelligence to create images and videos depicting children — sometimes real, sometimes “synthetic” — in sexually suggestive poses or acts. 
Possession of these kinds of images is already illegal in Pennsylvania, but the technology continues to develop faster than legislation can keep up. Protecting children “from the harmful aspects of AI” is an ongoing goal for Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery), whose newly authored bill was the focus of Monday’s Senate Majority Policy meeting. 
“We want to make sure our children are protected from bad actors,” said Pennycuick. “Children are now targeted in ways we never thought possible.” 
Mandated reporters in the state — including health care practitioners, teachers, clergymen and more — already must report suspected child abuse, which includes explicit materials, to law enforcement. Senate Bill 1050, would expand that to include content made by AI and builds upon previous laws that targeted deepfakes.

“Every day, I see the lifelong impact of what happens when a child’s body or image is misused,” said Leslie Slingsby, the CEO of services and operations at Mission Kids Advocacy Center in Montgomery County. “Today, technology is creating new ways for that harm to occur, even when a child was never physically present.”
Mission Kids provides specialized forensic interviews and trauma-informed therapy for children, pivoting to address AI-generated materials more recently. Not including so-called synthetic children — or images not based on one, unique child — throughout the state’s code is a “dangerous” loophole, Slingsby noted, that could allow consumers of these materials to work or volunteer with children. 
“Bringing AI-generated (child sex abuse materials) under mandated reporting law would, one, align in the spirit of child protection by recognizing that exploitation is exploitation, no matter how it’s created,” said Slingsby. “Second, gives investigators the authority to intervene early … and third, ensures protection for real children whose images are used, even if altered or fabricated.” 
In December, two Lancaster County juveniles were charged for creating dozens of AI-generated pornographic images of other minor students and a Buck County student was charged with a similar crime in July.
In both incidents, Pennycuick said mandated reporters “failed these students,” and one school allegedly contacted the perpetrator’s father, but not law enforcement.
 Tool for law enforcement

Angela Sperrazza, the chief deputy state attorney general with the General Child Predator Section, shared that just one referral for AI-generated child sexual abuse materials often reveals additional content. 
“Creating an explicit duty for mandated reporters to notify authorities when they believe a child has been victimized through child sexual abuse materials — traditional or AI-generated images — is a critical step toward early investigation and intervention,” said Sperrazza.
“A single referral can lead to the identification of devices, online networks, service providers and offenders before further harm can occur,” Sperrazza added.

The presence of this AI-generated media “has posed significant challenges” to law enforcement and prosecutors, said Gabriella Glenning, the assistant district attorney in Montgomery County. 
“Artificial intelligence has complicated the identification of (child sexual abuse material) victims, requiring substantial investigative resources to determine whether these images are authentic or digitally fabricated,” said Glenning. “It is now alarmingly simple to superimpose a person’s face onto altered images.” 
Glenning added that the suspicion of sexual exploitation and sexual extortion could be added to Pennycuick’s underlying bill, which could uncover blackmail attempts. Once reported to the state’s ChildLine, an investigator can determine if images or videos meet the criteria and how it was created.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The next chance for Louisiana homeowners to apply for up to $10,000 to upgrade their roofs to better withstand hurricanes starts Wednesday, with 1,000 grants available in qualifying areas.
Applicants for Louisiana Fortify Homes Program grants must reside in its coastal zone or in the cities of Lake Charles, Sulphur or Westlake. Even if homeowners have applied in a previous round for the Fortify grants, they must register for the next grant lottery between 8 a.m. Wednesday and 5 p.m. Nov. 19. To register, homeowners must create a profile on the LFHP website, where they should click the login button to begin the process.
Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple announced Monday the grant program has reached the milestone of funding 10,000 roofing projects. The grant typically doesn’t cover the entire cost of roof improvements needed, meaning homeowners must be able to cover the balance in order to receive the state money. 
Anyone interested in the program is encouraged to review the eligibility information, homeowner responsibilities and other important information at fortifyhomes.la.gov to determine whether they meet requirements.
Among the requirements to receive a grant is that the home must be a primary residence, and homeowners will be required to verify they have a homestead exemption on the property during the application process. 
A program evaluator will also have to determine whether the home is in good repair, and it must have active residential insurance with wind coverage as well as flood coverage where required.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s two senators expressed disappointment Monday, the day after eight of their Democratic colleagues broke away from the party’s majority to join Republicans in passing a short-term deal that should reopen the federal government by later this week.
The compromise will bring the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history to an end but without securing extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies.
US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown

“When you’re looking at the damage to Rhode Island’s health care system — I thought this was a fight worth pursuing,” Whitehouse said to reporters over Zoom Monday morning.
The subsidies, which help lower-income Americans afford private health insurance and expire at year’s end, were the key reason Senate Democrats refused to go along with the Republican bill funding government services past Oct. 1. Without Congressional action, those earning under 400% of the poverty level will see reduced aid, while others lose it entirely.
Nearly 40,000 Rhode Islanders rely on tax credits to afford coverage.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed in a video for members of Rhode Island’s press corps said he believed senators should have kept the pressure on what he said is a key pillar in entering and staying in the middle class.
“It is shameful that we’ll allow people to go without health care in the wealthiest country in the world,” Reed said.
The compromise includes only a promise that the Senate will vote on extending the subsidies by the second week of December. But Whitehouse said it never came with a guarantee that any Republicans will back the measure, nor does he believe it’s likely.
“Republicans seem to have a fetish for hurting health care,” Whitehouse said.
Reed too has his doubts.
“Their unwillingness to join us in a serious discussion about fixing this one problem — the tax credit for ACA health care — shows me that they’re not quite committed,” he said.
Though upset with his Democratic colleagues who broke ranks, he said he did not see the need to find a new majority leader who can ensure party unity. But Whitehouse said a lack of future compromise by Republicans could sway those who broke ranks from doing so again.
“If this is another Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown moment, I think all eight of them will be very, very angry and upset,” he said.
The full Senate must still vote on the compromise continuing resolution, which would bar federal agencies from firing employees until Jan. 30 and fund the federal food assistance program through Sept. 30, 2026 — preventing potential disruptions if another shutdown occurs before then.

Then the bill would head back to the House for consideration, where Democratic Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo have already voiced opposition without any provision extending health care subsidies.
“Trump and Republicans created a health care crisis we need to tackle,” Amo posted to X Sunday night. “Anything short of meaningful action on ACA tax credits doesn’t meet the moment.”
“My position has been that I will only vote for a budget that continues full affordable care act tax credit funding,” Magaziner posted.

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, has been in question amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and varying court orders. 
SNAP uncertainty spiking demand at Idaho food banks

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers the program to more than 130,000 Idahoans, said it began distributing funds Nov. 7 and aims to complete distributions by Wednesday. 
“Idaho is in the process of issuing partial benefits based on previous federal guidance and does not expect to have to undo those benefits,” Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “(Health and Welfare) will move to full benefits as soon as guidance is received that directs that action.” 
The typical maximum allowable SNAP payment may already be reduced for participants based on a formula that takes into account income, household size and some living expenses. The reduced payments are roughly 65% of the maximum allotment, minus the program’s typical reductions. The average monthly benefit in Idaho is $178 per household member. 
Recipients are encouraged to check their EBT cards, which are used to pay for groceries, and look for updates on the agency’s website at healthandwelfare.idaho.gov.

 SNAP guidance was volatile amid shutdown and court battles, leaving recipients without assistance

The move follows weeks of varying, sometimes conflicting, federal guidance and court orders related to the program. 
Here’s how things changed for the program:

Oct. 1: Because Congress failed to approve spending for the next fiscal year, the federal government shut down on Oct. 1, which meant many federal agencies did not have authorization to spend additional money. 
Oct. 22: Idaho Health and Welfare announced it would pause SNAP payments in November because funding had dried up during the ongoing shutdown. The federal United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, asked Idaho for the suspension. 
Oct. 24: The USDA, which administers SNAP federally, originally had a plan to tap contingency funds to continue paying the 42 million Americans who use the program, but reversed course and said it didn’t have the legal ability to continue making payments if the shutdown extended into November, the States Newsroom reported. 
Oct. 28, Oct. 30: The USDA’s decision to not provide more payments was challenged in two lawsuits in federal court systems in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island.  
Oct. 31:  A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to either provide full payments or partial payments using the contingency fund. The judge provided a written version of the ruling Nov. 1. 
Nov. 3: In response to the Rhode Island judge’s order, the USDA said in court filings it would authorize payments of about 50% of the maximum benefit with the program’s typical deductions for household income. However, the federal agency later said it miscalculated the reduction and clarified the reductions would be closer to 35% of the maximum allotment.  
Nov. 4: President Donald Trump wrote on social media that no payments would be made until the government reopened, which conflicted with the court documents from the USDA. 
Nov. 6: The Rhode Island judge ordered the federal government to pay the full benefit to recipients for November. 
Nov. 7: The USDA told states it would release full funding for November to comply with the court order, States Newsroom reported. 

Later that same day, the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to reverse the order to pay full benefits. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare distributed partial payments to about 15,000 Idahoans, the agency said. 
The Supreme Court that night temporarily blocked that lower court order to make the full payments, allowing the case to continue litigation in the lower appeals court. 


Nov. 8: Trump administration officials told states that provided full benefits to “undo” the action, and instead fund 65% of allotments. 
Nov. 9: The U.S. Senate on Sunday advanced a bill that would fund the government through the end of January, clearing a major hurdle toward potentially ending the shutdown, States Newsroom reported. 

 A separate federal appeals court denied the Trump administration’s request to halt the order to make full SNAP payments, the New York Times reported. 


Nov. 10: A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the directive for states to “undo” full benefits.

Idaho’s health agency is continuing to disperse reduced payments until it receives further guidance. New SNAP applications continue to be accepted, the agency said. 
The situation may cause longer wait times at call centers and offices, Health and Welfare’s website said Monday.  
Benefits provided under the federal Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, program are unaffected, according to Health and Welfare’s website on Monday.

Ron DeSantis confers with base officials following a mass shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Dec. 6, 2019. (Photo via Governor's Office)A federal appeals court has reinstated a portion of a lawsuit filed against Saudi Arabia by survivors of servicemembers killed by a Saudi Air Force pilot training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in 2019.
A federal trial judge had dismissed claims under numerous causes of action as precluded by the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.
However, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled Monday that another law — the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act — would allow claims that the Saudi government failed to properly vet the accused shooter, Mohammed Saeed Al-Shamrani, despite extensive evidence he was affiliated with al-Qaida and adhered to extremist views.
The court rejected claims including that the Saudi government failed to properly supervise Al-Shamran or that his allegedly intentional crime fell under an exemption to that government’s sovereign immunity. The government wasn’t liable for alleged acts of omission in screening Al-Shamrani, the opinion says.
However, “The Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Kingdom committed grossly negligent acts of commission rather than omission,” the court said.
Furthermore, in clearing Al-Shamrani to attended training at the NAS, the government cited “false information that was knowingly submitted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States,” the court continued.
“Second, the Amended Complaint asserts that on multiple occasions, Saudi Arabia conducted security screenings for Al Shamrani — deliberate and affirmative acts of will or exertion designed to accomplish an objective” of enrolling him in the training program.
“Third, Saudi Arabia nominated Al-Shamrani for, and awarded him, a scholarship which enabled him to go to Texas to learn English from August 2017 until May 2018, and then to participate in the flight training program at NAS Pensacola from May of 2018 until the time of the attack on December 6, 2019,” the court said.
‘Deliberate steps’
“These were all affirmative acts, deliberate steps undertaken by the Kingdom, not acts of omission. These acts enabled Al-Shamrani to enter and live at the military bases in San Antonio, Texas and then at NAS Pensacola. Finally, the Kingdom was responsible for the affirmative act of sending Al-Shamrani to the United States.”
Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus wrote the opinion for his colleagues Jill Pryor and Britt Grant. The ruling sends the case back to the trial court in the Northern District of Florida.
The shootings ended in the deaths of Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters. Six other servicemembers and seven Escambia County Sheriff’s deputies were wounded.
Court records include evidence Al-Shamrani was affiliated with al-Qaida and advocated for:

“The killing of Shia Muslims, non-Muslims and people who do not pray;
“The unfounded conspiracy that the Shia sect of Islam was founded by Jews to divide Muslims;
That Christians and Jews are the enemy of Islam, particularly to the Sunnis; and
“That Islam is under attack and threatened by Christians, Jews and Western culture.”

“Al-Shamrani also echoed the radical and violent teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric and member of AQAP [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] who was described as ‘perhaps the most prolific jihadist ideologue of all time,” the court said.
“Despite the repeated public expression of extremist and violent views, Al-Shamrani was one of two students in his RSAF class of hundreds awarded a scholarship to enter a joint military program in the United States,” it continued.
“Taking the allegations presented in the Amended Complaint as true (as we must at this stage in the proceedings), we are satisfied that under the terms of the congressional enactment in JASTA, this bundle of claims falls within one of the exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity,” the court wrote.
“These claims are facially sufficient because they are based on a series of acts of commission (rather than acts of omission) taken by the Kingdom in hiring and vetting Al-Shamrani that rose to the level of gross negligence under Florida law.”
NAS Pensacola is home to the Naval Aviation Schools Command, which provides flight training to U.S. personnel plus members of allied armed forces. Al-Shamrani’s supervisors reportedly were unaware that he’d purchased the Glock-45 handgun he used in the shootings.
Following the shootings, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he expected the Saudi government to pay.
“I think there’s obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi air force, and then to be here training on our soil to do this,” the governor said during a news conference at the base.

Prapass Pulsub/Getty Images) A former Iowa physician is suing a police detective who cited her for harassment after she publicly posted comments that she was “coming after” a former University of Iowa Hospitals colleague, who she called a “blue-eyed Hitler look alike.”
Dr. Ji Eun Lee is suing Detective Ian Mallory of the University of Iowa Police Department in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
In her lawsuit, Lee asserts that “university campuses should be a place where the value of free speech is upheld. However, at the University of Iowa, speech is tolerated only when it does not offend others.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit describes Lee as a medical doctor and “former U of I resident physician who was frustrated by the behavior of her former colleagues and leadership failures that permitted that behavior to go unpunished.” It alleges she “took to social media to share her frustrations” and that Mallory then later cited Lee for harassment when she continued to post such comments.
The lawsuit claims none of the speech that that led to the charge amounts to a “true threat,” and because of that, the U.S. Constitution does not permit punishment of such comments with criminal charges.
Lee included some of her own social media posts, some of which aren’t dated, as exhibits in her lawsuit against Mallory, including the following:
— A post referencing Karla Hemesath and Kate DuChene Hanrahan, two clinical professors of family and community medicine at the university, that said, “Hemesath? Still working on buttlickin #kateduchenehanrahan?”
— An Oct. 30, 2022, post in which Lee writes a definition of “sadism,” explaining it is “the desire and intention to hurt others, either verbally or physically, simply for the enjoyment of the act,” and which goes on to state, “Hey you f—ing Kate Thoma DuChene Hanrahan, Long time no see, you blue-eyed Hitler look alike. Actually a female version of it … I am a geriatrician now. I know what I am talking about … Keep yourselves busy. Cauz I am coming after you Aryan MOTHAF—ERS. You, your husbands, your children, your parents, you all going down. Taste some guilt, shame, depression, anxiety Attacks that we Minorities Face Every F—ing Day.”
— A post in which Lee writes, “I TELL YOU WHEN I STOP…. NOT YOU. NEVR YOU. ENUGH IS ENUGH. @bbs_us a third party should look into this unethical piece of crap@uihealthcare…”
Iowa Board of Medicine records indicate Lee’s license to practice in Iowa expired in June 2020, with no public record of discipline.
Lawsuit seeks punitive damages
In her lawsuit, Lee alleges that while working at UIHC, she came to believe other residents and supervisor physicians engaged in and tolerated disability discrimination and racism against minority resident physicians. Lee alleges she later used Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, to make comments that, “while direct and disparaging, did not threaten violence.”
On Dec. 19, 2022, Mallory received a report that Lee had made “online threats” to UIHC employees. The lawsuit alleges that Mallory’s summary report of his investigation states that “Dr. Lee’s writings were largely within the bounds of free speech but occasionally there were references to, ‘I’ll get you and your family’ directed towards some employees.”
On Jan. 14, 2023, Mallory sent Lee, then living in the Los Angeles area, a harassment warning by certified mail. In October 2023, the lawsuit claims, Lee decided to begin posting on social media about her dissatisfaction with various UIHC personnel. When Mallory learned of this, he called Lee and warned her that if she communicated with her former colleagues by posting comments about them on Twitter she would be criminally charged with harassment.
Lee continued to post about her former colleagues at UIHC and, her lawsuit claims, also posted a comment tied to the University of Iowa Police Department and its warning, stating, “I am not in the least bit threatened by this.”
On Nov. 9, 2023, Mallory filed a criminal complaint with the Johnson County Clerk of Court charging Lee with harassment.  In July 2024, the lawsuit claims, Lee learned there was a warrant for her arrest and hired an attorney who moved to dismiss the charge.
District Associate Judge Brandon Schrock granted the motion in an order dated May 30, 2025, ruling the criminal complaint “simply fails to allege conduct that would satisfy the elements of harassment” as outlined in Iowa law. The criminal complaint, Schrock found, “fails to state any facts which could be construed as intended to threaten, intimidate or alarm any of the prospective victims in this matter.”
While one post from Lee was alleged to constitute a true threat — the Oct. 30, 2022, ” I am coming after you” post — Schrock noted that it had been posted more than year before the criminal charge was filed on Nov. 10, 2023, and so it fell outside the statute of limitations for a simple misdemeanor.
The lawsuit alleges Mallory charged Lee with harassment “simply because she disobeyed” his warning to stop posting harassing comments about her former colleagues. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for violations of Lee’s First and 14th Amendment rights.
Mallory could not be reached for comment Monday and has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Court records indicate Lee graduated from Tufts University School of Medicine in 2017, receiving her M.D. degree there. She then began an internship and residency in family medicine at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
Lee left the UIHC residency program in 2019 and two years later, completed a family medicine residency program at Michigan State University. She is currently employed at a hospital in the greater Los Angeles area and, according to her lawsuit, she is currently licensed to practice medicine in California.
In her lawsuit, Lee is represented by Alan R. Ostergren of Iowa’s Kirkwood Institute, a self-described “conservative public-interest law firm.” The institute describes itself as “nonpartisan” and has been recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt public charity.

Owner Pat Malone said he might have converted the building to apartments instead, but city regulation that was adopted after  the previous years' flooding forbids apartments on the first floor.

This story by Phil Dodd was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 10, 2025.
Montpelier zoning permits refer to the renovation project at 140 Main Street in Montpelier as a hotel, but owner Pat Malone said the new business will operate more like a hybrid hotel, bed-and-breakfast, and Airbnb. Visitors will book online and get a code to open up their rooms, he said, but there will be no cooking facilities in the rooms, “though we will supply snacks for guests at breakfast.”
Previously, the large brick building was used as a law office. Malone said in addition to the rental rooms in the main building, there will also be rooms in a portion of the large carriage house behind the main structure. Both buildings on the property are listed as contributing structures on the National Register for Historic Places. Guests will have access to 13 parking spaces.
Construction inside and outside the property is underway, including the addition of a deck and patio for guests to sit outside in good weather. There will be a common room inside, and a room for a night manager. Malone said he hopes the building will be finished and ready to open in early spring.
Malone is currently operating two similar hospitality businesses — some of which do have kitchen facilities — in Barre and Waterbury Center, both listed on VRBO. A quick check showed prices for nightly stays in March 2026 running from $190 for one of the less expensive Barre units to $312 for a top-end Waterbury Center unit. 
“They do quite well,” he said. “We’re getting good demand in Barre, and we’re getting very good demand in Waterbury. So I think that Montpelier will do well.”
Malone said he might have converted the building to apartments instead, but city regulations that were adopted after the flood forbid apartments on the first floor. The city does allow hotel-type operations on first floors, he said. “I know a lot of people who would like first floor apartments,” but you can’t build those now, he said.
Malone has also been busy finishing up the renovation of the former Hugo’s restaurant location at 118 Main Street. That building will now house 25 single-room office suites with shared conference rooms, kitchenettes and common areas. It is a model he said he has successfully used in the upper floors of the former TD Bank building at the corner of State and Main streets in Montpelier.
A prior owner had signed a 20-year contract to heat the 118 Main building with the city’s district heat system, so Malone had to install expensive equipment so the district heat temperatures in the 25 rooms could be individually controlled. District heat is more expensive than alternative fuel sources, Malone said, but he decided “since I was paying for it, I probably should use it.”

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa saw its first snowfall over the past week, which Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said marked the “official end of the growing season.” 
While crop progress and condition statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are unavailable due to the ongoing government shutdown, Naig estimated that corn and soybean harvest in the state is coming to a close. 
“Based on my observations while traveling around the state and the conversations I’m having with farmers, harvest appears to be nearly complete,” Naig said in a statement Monday.

According to Naig, what he has heard from farmers is “in line” with five-year harvest averages that show 98% of soybeans and 91% of corn acres are typically harvested by mid-November. 
At this time last year, farmers had just 5% of corn left in the fields.
Brrr! Iowa’s first snow of the season 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan wrote in his weekly weather summary that temperatures took a “nose-dive” late into the Nov. 3 through Nov. 9 reporting period. 
Several towns in northwest Iowa reported the weekly low temperature of 13 degrees Fahrenheit, which Glisan said was 14 degrees below normal. 
Despite the drop in temperatures toward the end of the week, the overall average temperature for the period was 47.2 degrees. The statewide average was 3.4 degrees above the climatological normal. 
According to Glisan, more than 50 weather stations reported measurable snowfall during the reporting period. Pocahontas reported just slightly more than 5 inches of snow. 
The weekly precipitation average across the state was slightly under three-tenths of an inch, while the normal is 0.52 inch. 
The latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor showed 81% of Iowa was in abnormally dry or drought conditions. About 15% of the state, mostly on the eastern edge, was in moderate drought conditions.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, on Monday announced his support for redrawing Indiana’s congressional boundaries in a one-line statement.
“After careful consideration, researching the law and listening to my constituents, I have decided I will support mid-cycle congressional redistricting,” he said.
Koch is the 13th Senate Republican to signal support for new maps, with opposition from five senators in the 40-member GOP caucus. Others haven’t said their stance publicly.
He was the Senate sponsor of the 2021 bill that crafted new congressional and state legislative districts.
“The bill before you today is a result of a careful, collaborative effort and I believe it will serve our state well in the decade ahead,” Koch said during Senate debate on Oct. 1, 2021.
President Donald Trump and national Republicans have pushed Indiana and other GOP-led states to create more Republican U.S. seats by redistricting early. The next census isn’t scheduled until 2030.
Lawmakers will return Dec. 1 — at the behest of Gov. Mike Braun — to redistrict and make possible tax policy changes. Senate Republican leadership has said the chamber has not yet reached enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. A bill will need a majority of 26 votes or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Republicans currently have a 7-2 advantage in the state’s U.S. House delegation, with Democrats holding the 1st District in northwest Indiana and the 7th in Indianapolis.
In 2021, Koch touted the strength of the 1st District boundaries.

(Photo by Andrew Roth)Jeff Wiggins, press secretary and strategic advisor for Michigan Senate Leader Aric Nesbitt, is leaving the Senate press office to join the press team of House Speaker Matt Hall, the House confirmed Monday.
Wiggins, who also co-founded Victory Field Operations with consultant and Senate staffer Meghan Reckling, will now serve as Hall’s press secretary. No one from the House side of the press office was leaving to join the Senate side, Hall spokesperson Gideon D’Assandro told Michigan Advance.
Wiggins did not return a message seeking further comment on his reasoning for the departure from Nesbitt’s office. A message seeking comment from Joe Wicks, Nesbitt’s chief of staff, was not returned, either.
Last month, the Advance exclusively reported that Wiggins and Victory Field Operations were working for U.S. Rep. John James’ gubernatorial campaign. Nesbitt is also a candidate for governor and James is one of Nesbitt’s top rivals in the Republican gubernatorial hunt.
At least two well-connected Michigan political operatives told the Advance in a previous story that the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
Nesbitt staffer’s firm works for James campaign, raising ethics flags in GOP governor race

The Advance learned in October through public campaign finance data that Victory Field Operations was paid by James, not just for ballot access work but also political consulting via Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James.
Victory Field Operations was founded by Wiggins and Reckling, who is the chief of staff in the office of state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton).
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family. The Detroit News’ editorial page editor, Kaitlyn Buss, wrote about the influx of cash from members of the DeVos family to Mission Michigan in May.
Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.
James is viewed as a leading candidate for the office of governor on the Republican side, a campaign being waged against the better wishes of President Donald Trump and the leaders of the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Other Republicans seeking the GOP nomination include former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, pastor Ralph Rebandt and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota officials said Sunday they will not yank back food assistance that was distributed to recipients Friday, despite a weekend Trump administration order to do so. 
Here’s how we got to this point:
It starts with the shutdown
Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, expired at the end of October. Around 440,000 Minnesotans, most of whom are children, elderly or disabled, use SNAP to help pay for groceries.
SNAP recipients turned to food shelves in late October and early November as their monthly credits ran out and weren’t re-upped; at one food shelf, the Reformer witnessed volunteers turning away families for the first time, because there wasn’t enough food.
Minnesota and others sued, but then USDA pulled a slow one
At the end of October, advocates and some state attorneys general, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, filed two separate lawsuits to force the federal government to use contingency funds to pay for SNAP during the shutdown. 
The judge in the advocates’ suit in Rhode Island ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, to pay out full benefits by Nov. 3 or partial benefits by Nov. 5. The USDA sent states a methodology for calculating partial benefits on Nov. 3, but that process would take weeks or more to implement. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families last week couldn’t provide a timeline for when the benefits would be distributed according to the methodology provided by the USDA. 
Judge got mad, told USDA to pay up; Minnesotans got their credits
Then, on Thursday, the judge found that the USDA hadn’t complied with his earlier order — given the lengthy implementation timeline — and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to send states the money to cover November SNAP benefits by Friday. The administration complied, sending out the full funding for the month, which Minnesota immediately distributed to recipients. 
SNAP recipients contacted by the Reformer confirmed that they received their benefits over the weekend. 
The state even sent some benefits earlier than planned to “protect Minnesotans during the uncertainty of potential future court orders.”
You knew this was coming: Roberts Court says, ‘hold up’
State officials knew the U.S. Department of Justice was appealing the federal judge’s order on behalf of the USDA. Late Friday night, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling pausing the requirement that the Trump administration pay out full benefits. 
USDA says ‘pay us back’
No longer bound by the court order, USDA sent out another memo Saturday ordering states to only pay out 65% of recipients’ November benefits, and to “immediately undo” any actions that had been taken to make full payments. 
Minnesota says ‘nah’ 
The Department of Children, Youth, and Families said in a press release the agency was “appalled” at Saturday’s instructions to claw back the payments.
“Minnesota does not have any mechanism for taking money back from SNAP recipients. We also believe it would be unjust to yank back these funds that are needed to feed families,” the press release reads. 
Ellison confirmed Monday that “the money is flowing” in Minnesota. 
“If there was one throughline here, it is that Donald Trump and his administration have been fighting tooth and nail not to feed hungry Americans,” Ellison said in a press conference alongside other blue state attorneys general involved in litigation over the program. 
Seems like shutdown might — might! — be coming to a close, ending SNAP uncertainty 
The U.S. Senate took preliminary steps Sunday night to pass a spending bill that would reopen the government — without Democrats’ key demand, to extend health insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. 
The package that passed a key Senate procedural hurdle Sunday would fund the government, including SNAP, through January. 
But long term, Republicans have cut food aid
As the funding fight carries on, larger changes are happening to SNAP. A GOP mega-law signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years.
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people who can work and are between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and cost shifts to the states.
The law also eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle, resulting in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota.
The expanded work requirements took effect Nov. 1.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13-SNAP-1125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

(Kyle Sullivan, Bureau of Land Management/Flickr)A bipartisan piece of legislation that could have big impacts on the nation’s forest land continues to move quickly through Congress, pushing through a Senate committee last month.
The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.
The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.
“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”
The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.
The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation.
But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.
Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.
Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.
According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years.
Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.
And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.
“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”
Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.
Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.
“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”
Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous.
“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”
Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.
“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”

And many of them have called in sick,” Johnson said. “That’s a very stressful job and even more stressful, exponentially, when they’re having trouble providing for their families. And so air travel has been grinding to a halt in many places.”Johnson then told his colleagues in the House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, that lawmakers from both political parties “need to begin right now returning to the Hill.”Trump threatens air traffic controllersTrump took a markedly different tone over the challenges air traffic controllers have faced during the shutdown in a social media post that he published several hours before he spoke to reporters about the deal to reopen government. “All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn’t will be substantially ‘docked,’” Trump wrote, without explaining what that would mean for workers who had to take time off since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Trump added that he would like to find a way to provide $10,000 bonuses to air traffic controllers who didn’t require any time off during the past six weeks.“For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU. You didn’t step up to help the U.S.A. against the FAKE DEMOCRAT ATTACK that was only meant to hurt our Country,” Trump wrote. “You will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record. If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind!” An end in sightThe package will provide stopgap funding for much of the federal government through January 30, giving lawmakers a couple more months to work out agreement on nine of the dozen full-year spending bills.  The package holds several other provisions, including the full-year appropriations bills for the Agriculture Department, the Legislative Branch, military construction projects and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Seven Democrats and one independent broke ranks Sunday on a procedural vote that advanced the package, drawing condemnation from some House members and outside advocacy groups unhappy that no solution was arrived at to counter skyrocketing health insurance premium increases for people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major bills to move forward under the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech Monday he was “grateful that the end” of the stalemate was in sight. “We’re on the 41st day of this shutdown — nutrition benefits are in jeopardy; air travel is in an extremely precarious situation; our staffs and many, many other government workers have been working for nearly six weeks without pay,” Thune said. “I could spend an hour talking about all of the problems we’ve seen, which have snowballed the longer the shutdown has gone on. But all of us, Democrat and Republican, who voted for last night’s bill are well aware of the facts.”Schumer bid for deal on health care costs failsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was far less celebratory after his bid to get Republicans to negotiate a deal on health care costs by forcing a shutdown failed. “The past few weeks have exposed with shocking clarity how warped Republican priorities truly are. While people’s health care costs have gone up, Republicans have come across as a party preoccupied with ballrooms, Argentina bailouts and private jets,” Schumer said. “Republicans' breach of trust with the American people is deep and perhaps irreversible.” “And now that they have failed to do anything to prevent premiums from going up, the anger that Americans feel against Donald Trump and the Republicans is going to get worse,” Schumer added. “Republicans had their chance to fix this and they blew it. Americans will remember Republican intransigence every time they make a sky-high payment on health insurance.” Schumer was insistent throughout the shutdown that Democrats would only vote to advance a funding bill after lawmakers brokered a bipartisan deal to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of December for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. That all changed on Sunday when Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada voted to move the bill toward a final passage vote.Maine independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, also voted to advance the legislation.  Jeffries still supports SchumerHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a press conference Monday afternoon that he still believes Schumer is effective and should keep his role in leadership, despite the outcome. “Leader Schumer and Senate Democrats over the last seven weeks have waged a valiant fight on behalf of the American people. And I’m not going to explain what a handful of Senate Democrats have decided to do. That’s their explanation to offer to the American people,” Jeffries said. “What we’re going to continue to do as House Democrats, partnered with our allies throughout America, is to wage the fight, to stay in the coliseum, to win victories in the arena on behalf of the American people notwithstanding whatever disappointments may arise,” he said. “That's the reality of life, that’s certainly the reality of this place. But we’re in this fight for all the right reasons.” Speaker Johnson said earlier in the day that the “people’s government cannot be held hostage to further anyone’s political agenda.

The store is a project started by Heppner, who is under indictment for financial fraud for allegedly siphoning $150 million from a now-bankrupt company. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel) TOPEKA — Texas businessman Brad Heppner’s insistence on construction of a grandiose $20 million grocery store in Hesston proved too complicated for the project to get off the ground before the unsealing of an indictment alleging he orchestrated a $150 million financial fraud.
Federal charges against Heppner, who was CEO of the Beneficient company in Dallas and a founder of the Beneficient Heartland Foundation in Hesston, were revealed days before an interim committee of the Kansas Legislature convened to review activities tied to Beneficient. The Legislature several years ago ordered state regulators to issue a unique bank charter to fuel Beneficient’s business catering to wealthy investors trying to unload illiquid assets. In exchange, Heppner promised to fund rural economic development in Kansas.
The House-Senate oversight committee was keen to hear from Beneficient executives about fallout from Heppner’s indictment for purportedly pilfering $150 million from a now-defunct company. The cash was allegedly funneled through Beneficient into other business entities for Heppner’s personal use. The U.S. Department of Justice offered no indication the alleged malfeasance involved the Heartland Foundation.
The bipartisan legislative committee also was eager for an update on the effort to deliver on Heppner’s 2022 promise to build a grocery store in Hesston, where he grew up. Hesston has 3,400 residents and has been without a grocery store since 2018.
Financing for the downtown grocery store would be derived from the Heartland Foundation. It was established with an initial donation of about $6.5 million from Heppner and his wife, Aurelia. Cash or stock generated by Beneficient’s asset-management business would be sent to the foundation.
Denise Goevert, chair of the board of directors of Beneficient Heartland Foundation, told state legislators that Heppner’s absence from the grocery store conversation in Hesston would allow community members to take the lead. It should clear the path for a more basic store costing less than $10 million, she said.
“You guys get rid of the stupid underground parking garage?” asked Rep. Rick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican and chairman of the interim committee.
“Thank you, yes, and no tunnel,” said Goevert, eliciting a few chuckles in the Capitol meeting room.
“I call it like I see it guys,” Hoheisel said.
 
Climate-controlled parking
Heppner’s plan called for a “climate-controlled, weather-friendly garage that keeps shoppers out of the elements.” There would be golf carts with free battery chargers, but also parking capacity “exceeding town ordinances.” Heppner pushed for a store of 18,000 to 20,000 square feet of space at street level, a delicatessen-style restaurant, a bakery, an on-site butcher, locally sourced produce and German food specialties.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican and a member of the interim legislative committee, said Heppner’s vision was “quite ostentatious.”
Owens was a member of the foundation board for more than one year but stepped down because he concluded that role could be viewed as a conflict of interest. He said the grocery project was important to Hesston’s future.
At the outset of planning for a grocery store in 2022, Heppner said his vision for the foundation was to demonstrate how Beneficient and rural Kansas communities could be “ambitious and work together.”
“My success today is built on a strong foundation of community and values, a reflection of the place where I grew up,” Heppner said at the time.
Heppner said during presentations to committees of the House and Senate hat he was inspired to pursue the grocery store idea because his mother expressed frustration Hesston didn’t have a market in town. Heppner resigned from Beneficient in June.
Meanwhile, Kansas banking commissioner David Herndon, who has limited jurisdiction over Beneficient’s activities in Kansas, told legislators the Office of State Bank Commissioner had information indicating the limited liability company formed by the Heartland Foundation to handle the grocery project “forfeited its standing in Kansas for failure to file its annual report with the secretary of state” by a July 15 deadline.
Goevert said she would check with the foundation’s accounting firm to determine why the LLC filing wasn’t made on time.
 
Overhaul grocery plan
In the legislative committee briefing, Goevert said Hesston community leaders involved with the foundation could sell as much as $1 million in real estate acquired by the foundation. That cash could be poured into a more reasonably sized grocery store, she said.
Goevert said the foundation also must find a way to reduce the amount of capital required to construct the store. Instead of relocating a Hesston lending institution and blending that vacant structure into a grocery store, she said, it might be possible to find an alternate site along Main Street that wouldn’t require expensive structural demolition or utility upgrades.
“With the change in leadership at Beneficient, we’ve taken a step back as a board to evaluate our initial plan,” she said. “This has been a challenge, and especially within the last several months.”
Goevert, a former Hesston school teacher, owns The Nest, a store near Main Street occupying retail space made possible by the foundation.
The new grocery store must be large enough serve needs of local residents doing their grocery shopping and help drive prosperity in nearby businesses, she said.
“We need a sustainable grocery store,” Goevert said. “As a board, we are focused on simplifying and streamlining the grocery store project.”
Optimistically, she said, the right-sized project in proximity to Main Street could come to fruition in 2027. White’s Foodliner, which operates grocery stores in Kingman, Linsborg, Lyons and other Kansas communities, remains committed to managing a new store in Hesston, she said.
“We know there is a desire for visible activity,” she said. “We need to be moving forward at a a faster pace.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Denise-Goevert-hesston-2-1024x577.png,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

Jim Pillen appointed Douglas County District Court Judge Derek R. Vaughn on Monday as the next associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court.
The appointment for the Supreme Court’s Second Judicial District replaces the first woman on Nebraska’s high court with the high court’s first person of color, according to state records and national data since 1960.

Vaughn served Douglas County as a county court judge for a decade before Pillen elevated him to the district court two years ago. He will represent the Omaha-area seat previously held by former Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, who retired Oct. 31, having served since 1998.
“I’m ready to pull my sleeves up and ready to get to work,” Vaughn said Monday.
‘I see people for people’
Vaughn graduated from the Nebraska College of Law in 1999 and served in the Douglas County Attorney’s Office between then and 2013, when former Gov. Dave Heineman appointed him to the county bench. Vaughn handled civil and criminal cases, as well as cases in problem-solving courts. He also is now one of four drug court judges in Douglas County.

As a prosecutor, Vaughn said he worked with people at their worst — including some without hope or family support — whom he wanted to provide second chances. As a judge, Vaughn said he came “full circle” and encouraged and motivated people facing similar situations in his courtroom.
“People may be telling you that you’re nothing, and I’m saying that you matter, you’re somebody,” Vaughn said of that work. “It’s wonderful when the light clicks back on.”
He continued: “I see people for people, and I’m going to treat people the way that I would want to be treated, with respect, with dignity.”
‘Unmatched’ love for family, community
Pillen said Vaughn’s background in a family that believes in the power of education and public service, as well as his dedication to community, were among the qualities that stood out for the appointment. The governor described Vaughn’s love of family and community as “unmatched.”
“It is the combination of that court experience, community involvement, incredible reputation and commitment to our state that makes Justice Vaughn a great choice to serve in our state Supreme Court,” Pillen said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Omaha attorney Patrick Guinan and Vaughn were the only candidates to apply for the Supreme Court seat. The duo faced public interviews in mid-October and both applicants were forwarded to Pillen for his consideration. At least two candidates must be considered for judicial appointments.
Vaughn said the lack of lawyers seeking vacant judgeships, particularly in more rural areas, is one the biggest challenges facing the judicial branch and that the “next generation of judges” needs to be engaged. Pillen agreed in wanting to emphasize the privilege of being a public servant.
The Nebraska Supreme Court consists of six associate justices who serve specific judicial districts and a chief justice who serves the state at large. Every member of the state Supreme Court attended Vaughn’s appointment ceremony.
Nebraska Supreme Court justices are paid a salary of $228,431.18. District court judges are paid $211,298.84.
Vaughn’s appointment will head to voters in the Second Judicial District beginning in the 2028 general election. If retained, he would face a retention vote every six years, pursuant to the Nebraska Constitution.
Day in court
As a trial court judge, Vaughn said he viewed himself as the impartial “referee” for lawyers and worked to ensure that the process was fair. He said he would take that understanding to the Supreme Court and that he often tells people, “I have no agenda. This is your day in court.”
“I want people to feel that even if you’re upset with the decision, that you were heard and that whatever position that you may be taking, that it was considered, and you can understand the reasoning behind the opinions,” Vaughn said.

Vaughn said the Supreme Court seemed a “natural fit.” He noted that his father was the first African American game management agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the first African American U.S. marshal for the District of Nebraska. His mother was a long-time teacher. He said he grew up with “outstanding role models” who encouraged education.
“Never forget where you came from and be involved,” Vaughn said. “Do the best that you can do.”
Vaughn said he interviewed with Pillen one morning in Lincoln and had to return to Omaha for court. Vaughn said he was “elated” and “speechless” to learn he would be appointed, earning a laugh from family when he said he is “not normally lost for words.”
Vaughn’s wife, two adult children, mother, nieces, sisters and pastor joined him Monday.
“This is my village here, at least part of my village, and I’m so honored and humbled just to be here today,” Vaughn said. “Thank you, Governor Pillen, for this amazing opportunity.”
A ‘people person’
Nebraska Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, a former county attorney for Lancaster County and later U.S. attorney for Nebraska, has helped Pillen with his now-three Supreme Court appointments. Pillen elevated Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke in November 2024 and selected now-Justice Jason Bergevin to succeed Funke

Kelly said he has known Vaughn for more than 20 years across two county attorneys’ offices. Kelly said Vaughn is a “likable guy” and “people person” who became a fast friend.
“He’s a great guy to know and great to watch him in the community and the things that he does off the bench that keep him keyed in,” Kelly said.
Pillen said he has been in Vaughn’s community many times over the past three years as governor and always saw Vaughn as an active member with a great heart. Pillen said Vaughn is the same man he was when he became a county judge in 2013.
“I’m focused on people’s eyes, not their color, not where they’re at, just on their eyes and who they are. Eyes are the gateway,” Pillen said. “I couldn’t be more proud to have appointed Judge Vaughn.”

ByHeart recalled two lots of infant formula on Saturday, according to a Centers for Disease Control Prevention post on the investigation. The recall of the formula, which makes up less than 1% of infant formula sales, won’t cause shortages, the CDC said.
The 13 suspected or confirmed botulism cases come from 10 states and includes one case in Minnesota from August. No deaths have been reported.
Botulism is a serious, rare and potentially fatal illness caused by ingesting a poison called botulinum toxin that is produced by a bacteria. The illness is highly treatable but, when untreated, can lead to difficulty breathing, paralysis and death. The best known way infants under 12 months get botulism is through ingesting honey.
The CDC says that parents should throw away or return recalled formula, wash items that have touched any recalled formula and seek immediate medical care if an infant has consumed ByHeart formula and has symptoms of botulism.
Symptoms include difficulty feeding and swallowing, loss of head control, constipation, a weak cry and decreased facial expression. Though symptoms usually begin 18 to 36 hours after ingesting the toxin, CDC’s notice also warns that symptoms can take as long as weeks to develop.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/formula-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota has submitted a request to the federal government to prohibit North Dakotans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from using their benefits to buy soft drinks, energy drinks or candy. 
If approved, products like chewing gum, chocolate-covered nuts, sweetened cereal bars and energy shots will soon be off-limits under the program.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services submitted the waiver request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in late October. The state wrote in the proposal that it would  take roughly eight months to implement the changes.
“This waiver request addresses public health challenges across ND by aiming to improve the nutritional well-being of SNAP participants,” the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services wrote in the document.
The new policy would require the roughly 600 retailers that take SNAP benefits in North Dakota to update their sales systems so that any attempt to purchase prohibited items with SNAP money is automatically declined, according to the waiver request.
Partial food assistance benefits available in North Dakota

The state is pursuing the food ban in part to secure more money from the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. While states will get at least $500 million from the grant, federal guidelines state that they could be eligible for more if they implement certain health-related policies, including SNAP waivers.
In its application for Rural Health Transformation Program money submitted earlier this week, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services wrote that it expects its SNAP waiver to be approved in early November.
The waiver request states that soft drinks would include “any carbonated, nonalcoholic beverages that contain water, a sweetening agent” and flavoring. The definition specifically excludes carbonated flavored water and powdered drink flavorings.
The waiver request defines energy drinks as beverages made “to enhance energy, alertness, or physical performance” that contain stimulants like “fortified caffeine, guarana, glucuronolactone or taurine.” It says sports drinks like Powerade and Gatorade don’t fall under this category.
Candy is defined in the proposal as products containing “sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.” The definition excludes food containing flour and food that must be refrigerated. It says honey, sugar, molasses, maple syrup and corn syrup by themselves don’t count as candy.
According to the document, “chocolate covered nuts, candy coated nuts, honey roasted nuts, caramel apples, trail mix with candy pieces” would all count as candy. Sweetened cereal bars without flour and energy bars “containing a ‘supplemental facts’ box” would also be considered candy, it states.
The waiver request indicates that it won’t cost much money for the state of North Dakota to implement the food restrictions because most of those expenses will be carried by retailers that accept SNAP benefits.

The North Dakota state government will soon begin reaching out to those businesses to notify them of the change. It will provide them with technical assistance if needed, the proposal states.
It also says the state will be taking steps to ensure SNAP recipients in North Dakota are informed of the changes.
According to the proposal, about 83,000 North Dakotans received SNAP benefits during the 2025 fiscal year.

The rainbow flag of the gay pride movement and the flag of the United States | Getty ImagesThe United States Supreme Court has declined to revisit the 2015 landmark ruling that gave same-sex couples marriage equality, a failure for former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis.
Davis made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. With the help of conservative legal firm Liberty Counsel, Davis has tried to avoid paying $100,000 as ordered by a federal jury to one of the couples she refused, David Ermold and David Moore. She ultimately tried to use that appeal to challenge Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that required states to license same-sex marriages.
The nation’s highest court on Monday said it will not hear the challenge.
Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman who represents Davis, said he “will continue to work to overturn Obergefell.”
“Davis was jailed, hauled before a jury, and now faces crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings,” Staver said. “By denying this petition, the High Court has let stand a decision to strip a government defendant of their immunity and any personal First Amendment defense for their religious expression.”

Kevin Jennings, the CEO of Lambda Legal, a pro-LGBTQ+ advocacy law firm, called the case “frivolous” in celebrating its defeat.
“This is a victory not only for the LGBTQ+ community, but for everyone who believes in our Constitution and the rule of law. The court’s decision reaffirms a simple fact: equal protection of the law applies to all, not just some,” Jennings said in a statement. “This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history.”
Jenny Pizer, Lambda Legal’s senior director of strategic initiatives said the decision to not hear the case by the Supreme Court “rightly leaves marriage equality crystal clear and undisturbed.”
Pizer said LGBTQ+ people and their families “still need vigilance and protection,” though.
“We secured the freedom to marry for same-sex couples over a decade ago in our landmark 2015 Supreme Court victory, Obergefell v. Hodges, thanks to the powerful stories of thousands of couples and their families throughout the country, including in our many court cases,” Pizer said. “The fundamental rights of liberty and equal protection that the court affirmed back then remain essential for all American families today.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Issues with outside vendors handling West Virginia’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are the hold up to thousands of residents getting their food stamps amount, while some other states have already begun distributing benefits. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey told reporters on Monday that he is “aggressively” pushing vendors to get partial benefits loaded onto residents’ EBT cards — what they use to make food purchases with SNAP — as quickly as possible. 
A Saturday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said states should fund 65% of SNAP benefits, and West Virginia has to calculate that amount for about 275,000 residents who use the program.
Morrisey said the SNAP processing vendors were having “a lot of technical issues and feasibility issues.”
“I’ve made it clear that I want us to be running as fast as possible to be able to get these systems working,” he said. “I’ve had calls and meetings today on that to really challenge all the contractors to move very fast … They must. I mean, people’s lives are at stake, and we need people to do their job confidently.”
SNAP benefits were delayed for millions of Americans at the start of this month due to the federal government shutdown.
As a result, West Virginia food banks have seen a high increase in need. National Guard members continue to help with food distributions around the state.
Morrisey said that if the government reopens, he believed the state could quickly load EBT cards with full benefits for residents.
“I want to emphasize the quickest way all this comes to an end is for the shutdown to end, because what they say, from a technical perspective, is that they can more quickly load up the full benefits than any of the partial benefits,” the governor said. 
While West Virginia figures out its SNAP calculations, a national legal battle from the Trump administration over food stamps could impact the amount residents will receive, as well. 
A federal appeals court on Sunday rejected a bid from President Donald Trump to pay only partial benefits to Americans during the shutdown. In response, the Trump administration told the Supreme Court that it intends to continue seeking a stay of a lower court’s order requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits until the shutdown ends.
Morrisey announces another $2M for food banks, still mulling special legislative session 
While the SNAP processing issues continue, Morrisey announced another $2 million in funding on Monday for food banks, bringing the state’s contribution to more than $13 million.
“We don’t know the exact date in terms of when the government would be open, and I want to make sure that no one goes hungry,” Morrisey said. 
There is a bipartisan deal advancing in the U.S. Senate that could move to end the government shutdown after key Democrats split from their party Sunday night to join Republicans in moving the measure forward. The package restores pay and protections for federal workers and would also fully fund SNAP through next September.
It doesn’t extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year that Democrats had been holding out for.
The GOP-controlled House would still need to vote on it before it could head to Trump’s desk to be signed. 
Morrisey promised around $14 million to food banks during the SNAP delay and said he’d call in the Legislature for a special session to appropriate more funds if the need exceeds that amount. 
With the unknowns in Washington, D.C., Morrisey is still considering bringing in the Legislature.
“From the conversations with the food banks, we’re in a good position to at least Nov 17,” Morrisey said. “But I don’t want to fall behind this … So if it’s later today or tomorrow — I want to make sure that we’re gauging what’s going on — if I need to call the Legislature back in, I’ll probably know in the next 24 to 36 hours. I won’t be afraid to do it.”
The governor urged residents in need of a home food delivery to call or text 211, the state’s 24/7 helpline.

Sublette County resident is free while awaiting trial and isn’t required to post bond to stay out of jail. 
The post Infamous wolf captor Cody Roberts pleads not guilty, trial set for March appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—The Sublette County man who allegedly snowmobiled into a wolf and then brought it into a Western Wyoming bar for hours to amuse friends and family will fight his felony charge, sending one of the country’s highest-profile animal cruelty cases in years toward a trial. 
Appearing virtually before Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery on Monday afternoon, Cody Roberts initially ran into technological issues — his camera wasn’t working for over five minutes, and the judge was requiring him to appear on video. Eventually, aided by Laramie attorney Rob Piper, who was also appearing by video, Roberts got his computer camera functioning. 
The legal proceedings lasted only about 15 minutes. Roberts told the judge he understood the charges being brought against him, which Lavery read from an amended indictment. 
Roberts “knowingly and with intent to cause undue suffering” … “tortured or tormented” a “male gray wolf,” the judge read from the charging document.
“How do you plead?” Lavery asked.
“Not guilty,” Roberts said.

Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich, who spearheaded the case against Roberts, did not speak in any depth about his case or foreshadow his legal arguments. 
On Feb. 29, 2024, Roberts brought the injured wolf into the Green River Bar in Daniel and tormented the muzzled animal for hours. The longtime resident, who owns a trucking business, was drinking and made a joke out of the wolf’s plight, according to an eyewitness. But the young wolf’s languid behavior suggested that it was suffering from massive internal injuries after reportedly being legally struck with a snowmobile until it was “barely conscious,” according to state officials.  
The resulting outrage was intense, inflamed both by photos that emerged from the night and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s initial response. Wardens fined him $250 for possession of warm-blooded wildlife instead of forcing him to make a mandatory court appearance and face possible stiffer penalties. 
By mid-April 2024, Robert’s treatment of the wolf had drawn intense scorn and indignation, which filtered in from around the world. The online outrage was so overwhelming that the state of Wyoming had to cease tourism promotion on its social media channels. 
Monday’s arraignment was the first time that Roberts had publicly addressed his actions. WyoFile has made repeated attempts to interview him without success. 
During his Monday arraignment, neither Roberts, nor his attorney, Piper, spoke about the events from spring 2024. 
Shortly after the treatment of the wolf blew up in the media, Sublette County law enforcement officials made it clear they disagreed with Game and Fish’s interpretation of Wyoming’s animal cruelty statutes. The state agency maintained that those laws — which carry more severe penalties — didn’t apply because of the wolf’s “predatory animal” status. The county opened its own probe that stayed active for more than a year, examining whether Roberts should be charged with felony animal cruelty.

Ultimately, Melinkovich turned the decision to indict Roberts over to a grand jury — a rarely used tool in the state court system that gave the county attorney subpoena power and the ability to examine witnesses who weren’t otherwise willing to testify. 
The grand jury proceedings last summer occurred behind closed doors and all associated records are sealed. On Aug. 20, the 12-person panel returned a “true bill” resulting in the indictment against Roberts, charging him with a felony that could carry up to two years in jail.
The county’s prosecuting attorney did not ask Lavery that Roberts be booked into custody, nor did he ask that Roberts post a monetary bond to remain out of jail.
“I see no concerns with Mr. Roberts not remaining or returning to the area to face these charges at trial,” Melinkovich said. 
Roberts’ trial is scheduled for 9 a.m. March 9. 
Although the first step in the felony charges against Roberts was held virtually, a video feed of the proceedings was streamed at the Sublette County District Court.  
Only five people were present in the room, and four of them were journalists. The only other member of the public who showed up was Peggy Bell, who said she was Robert’s middle school librarian.

(Screenshot by South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services says it began preparations over the weekend to issue partial food assistance benefits for this month, but the department is also keeping open the possibility that it could pay full benefits.
In either case, said an advisory on the department’s website as of Monday afternoon, benefits won’t come until “later this week.” The 10th day of the month, which was Monday, is the normal day for payment of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the state.
RF Buche, whose Buche Foods stores serve many SNAP participants in South Dakota, said it’s not clear when benefits might come or whether those benefits will be the full amount or a partial amount.
“Right now, we’re just sitting and waiting,” Buche said. “Waiting to hear what comes next, and hoping that what we hear next will be accurate.”
Rapidly changing situation
The confusion comes in response to federal government shutdown-related chaos affecting the program that helps 42 million Americans, including 75,000 South Dakotans, afford groceries.
On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the program’s full November benefits, despite the ongoing shutdown.
South Dakota won’t tap reserve funds to fill federal food assistance gap, governor says

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states it was releasing full November funding for SNAP, and the South Dakota Department of Social Services said it would pay full benefits Monday.
Later Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected Tuesday. The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday by saying it had “paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits.”
A Saturday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said states should fund 65% of benefits. In South Dakota, said the Department of Social Services, paying partial benefits “involves several days of system programming and approval.” 
Meanwhile, the department said, it is “also monitoring the probability that Congress will act to re-open the federal government this week.” On Sunday night, the U.S. Senate advanced a bill that could end the shutdown, but the legislation still needs final Senate approval and also needs approval from the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump.
“DSS will issue November benefits — either partial or full, depending on the timing of Congress’s actions — later this week,” said a message on the state department’s website as of Monday morning.
Crow Creek eying backstops
Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek took to his tribe’s Facebook communications page to warn members that no SNAP checks would come Monday, but that state officials “assured me they are working diligently on the issue.”
“The tribe is also working to fill that gap by partnering with private entities, local churches and tribal programs to provide the necessary food items as needed,” Lengkeek wrote. “I will pass along information as I receive it.”
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Lengkeek said Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff took his call Monday and told him the agency intends to get SNAP benefits of 65% out to South Dakotans by Wednesday. 
About 40% of people in Buffalo County, where the tribe’s headquarters are located, receive SNAP benefits.
The Crow Creek tribe has worked on building a food sovereignty program since 2020, Lengkeek said, in response to near-shortfalls in food availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tribe purchased a herd of elk, as well as buffalo and cattle, and built up a processing plant. 
Typically, the livestock operation functions as a money-maker for the tribe, Lengkeek said, but the animals can also serve as a backstop in situations where food may run out. The tribe is prepared to slaughter some of its buffalo and cattle if necessary, Lengkeek said. 
The tribe also recently set up a soup kitchen in Fort Thompson that opens three times a week, serving as many as 300 each time. That happened before the government shutdown, the chairman said.
“Wages are stagnant, benefits have been stagnant, so we’ve had to do that to fill the gap,” he said.
Grocer uses nonprofit to distribute food vouchers
RF Buche is president of Buche Foods, a grocer that serves many tribal communities, including on the Crow Creek reservation. Like Lengkeek, he said SNAP payments aren’t high enough at current prices.
The payments are nonetheless critical for many South Dakota families, Buche said.
Three of the nation’s most SNAP-dependent counties are centered on tribal land in South Dakota, and benefit recipients in those low-population counties represent an outsized share of the $15 million in monthly SNAP benefits paid throughout the state. Those counties include Todd County, home of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and Oglala Lakota County, home of the Pine Ridge Reservation.
“In Todd and Oglala Lakota alone, you’re looking at $2.5 million in benefits,” Buche told South Dakota Searchlight, estimating that another $5 million in benefits flow to families who live in the other tribal communities served by his stores.
Three of the nation’s most SNAP-dependent counties are in South Dakota

There have been some inventory and ordering headaches for Buche’s store managers over the past few weeks and into the weekend, but those issues, he said, “are minute in comparison to what families are going through when they don’t know where their next meal is coming from.”
Team Buche Cares, the grocer’s nonprofit arm, distributed about $300,000 in food vouchers to SNAP-eligible families over the weekend. That was facilitated in part by donations that came after the SNAP concerns bubbled over with the government shutdown. 
A Wagner business owner donated enough to feed 50 families “without being asked,” Buche said, and a Pine Ridge store’s appearance in a CNN article spurred additional donations.
“People from all over the country have been sending anything from $10 on up,” Buche said. “It’s been very humbling.”
In his interview with Searchlight, Lengkeek said he’s been grateful to Buche for the assistance on the Crow Creek Reservation. Anna Halverson, an Oglala Sioux Tribal Council representative, expressed a similar sentiment. It’s “nothing new” for Buche’s charitable arm to offer aid to Pine Ridge, she said, but it’s also not especially uncommon for tribes to find themselves in the position of needing help.
It’s not supposed to be like that, Halverson said. Treaties inked between the U.S. government and tribal leaders in 1851 and 1868 were meant to guarantee food security for Native Americans in exchange for land. Halverson said cuts or proposed cuts to SNAP, as well as the threat of benefit losses in a shutdown, open old wounds from broken treaty promises.
“As leaders, it feels like our people’s basic human needs are being used as bargaining chips,” Halverson said. “Food should never be a weapon.”
Feeding South Dakota: More people using food network
Stacey Andernacht, a spokeswoman for Feeding South Dakota, said her organization’s statewide food distribution network has also seen a boost in support over the past month. 
Shortly after the shutdown began, the group put up a banner on its website asking for support to provide 500,000 more meals in response to both a pre-shutdown spike in need and the anticipated need that would appear with a loss or cut in SNAP benefits.
The help has been welcome and necessary, but Andernacht said it’s unrealistic to expect donations to cover the loss of SNAP. The program provides nine meals for every one that Feeding South Dakota does, she said.
States told by Trump administration to ‘undo’ full SNAP benefits paid for November

“You’d be talking about trying to grow our inventory ten times,” she said.
Feeding South Dakota does about 100 mobile food distribution events each month. Last week saw 25 such distributions. Not all of them saw an increase in visitors, but the average increase for those that did was 21%. 
In July, the organization asked for $3 million from state government in the state’s upcoming budget to continue to help the same number of families it historically has. Earlier this month, Feeding South Dakota said its need has grown beyond that amount; meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight he was unaware of the funding request.
On Monday, Andernacht said the organization has been “hyperfocused on the response” to the SNAP situation and hasn’t re-engaged with lawmakers on funding. She expects the topic to come up when the Legislature convenes for the 2026 session in January, though.
“The community is engaging and we’re getting great support, but it’s hard when you start from behind,” she said.

Special Superior Court Judge Clayton D. Somers granted a preliminary injunction to children who had sued through their parents over the rate cuts. 
Somer’s ruling means payment rates to providers of Applied Behavioral Analysis cannot be cut before a trial. ABA aims to improve social skills and communication, increase positive behavior and reduce negative behavior, according to the Cleveland Clinic. 
Starting Oct. 1, NC DHHS cut rates to Medicaid providers anywhere from 3% to 10%, claiming the legislature did not appropriate enough money to the insurance program to see it through the budget year. 
Attempts by the legislature to approve increased Medicaid funding became tangled in disagreements between House and Senate Republicans. Republicans have criticized the Medicaid cuts as unnecessary. 
Last week, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, called the General Assembly back for a special legislative session on Nov. 17 to approve more Medicaid money. The legislature is not required to approve additional funding at the special session. 
The lawsuit against NC DHHS was brought by 21 children through their parents or guardians, who say the 10% cut to ABA is discriminatory because it targets children with a disability.  
All the children who sued are on Medicaid and rely on behavioral healthcare treatment for autism or are on waiting lists for that care, said Michael Easley Jr., one of their lawyers. 
Easley described his clients as “unfairly caught in the middle of a political budget impasse” that could lead to the denial of Medicaid services they rely on, placing them at increased risk of institutionalization or segregation. 
But an attorney for DHHS said the agency’s cuts to ABA therapy are not discriminatory. Adrian W. Dellinger, a lawyer with the state Department of Justice representing the agency, said it also made 10% rate cuts to other services, including to surgical centers, anesthesiology providers and free-standing birth centers.
“These cuts were made with deliberation, not malice,” Dellinger said. 
ABA providers received a 15% rate increase on Jan. 1, 2024, Dellinger told the court. After that increase, spending on ABA increased sharply, with five providers accounting for 41% of the increased spending. 
In 2023, before the rate increase, Medicaid spent $199 million on ABA. Costs were projected to increase 425% by 2026. 
Even with the reduction, Dellinger said, NC Medicaid will pay more for ABA than it did in 2023, and at rates higher than in 42 other states. 
Somers, who served as chief of staff to former Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, pressed Dellinger on whether the legislature could be trusted to come up with the additional money.  Moore appointed Somers to the bench in 2023. 
Somers also repeatedly asked Dellinger if DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai could be trusted to reverse the rate cuts if the legislature appropriated more money. 
“At the end of the day, this is about trust,” Somers said. Medicaid won’t run out of money until May, he said, while the children could suffer irreparable harm. 
Somers said Sangvai “used a scalpel” to make the cuts. “One might say he made these cuts with surgical precision,” Somers said, echoing a 2016 federal appeals court ruling that struck down a Republican election law the court found targeted Black voters. 
Rhonda Huey of Charlotte smiled with relief after Somers blocked the ABA Medicaid rate cut. 
Huey, who attended the hearing with other parents, said she has two sons with autism, an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old. 
She attended school every day with her eldest son for six years, but no longer has to because of the improvements brought about by ABA. He has now moved out of classes for exceptional children and into a regular classroom, she said. 
ABA “just turned it around,” Huey said. 
She was worried because her son’s provider had said they may no longer accept Medicaid if rates are cut. 
“You could see the difference and impact,” she said. “My baby had missed a lot of birthday parties. We couldn’t go to church. We couldn’t do a lot of things.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NCPW-CC-2014-09-30-judicial-finance-gavel.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee made clear the Trump administration was to blame for the “chaos and hardship” created by the series of conflicting directives over federal food assistance for low-income families.
But McKee’s Sunday afternoon statement was fuzzy on whether Rhode Island will comply with an eleventh-hour U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) memo, demanding states undo the payments that in some cases had just been distributed to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) hours earlier. 
“We have reached out directly to Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) within the USDA related to the latest federal communication,” McKee said. “At this time, recipients’ [electronic benefit transfer] cards remain active, and we are seeing Rhode Islanders successfully using those cards.”
He also alluded to in-progress “contingency strategies,” promising, “we will continue to keep Rhode Islanders updated.”
McKee’s office did not respond to multiple requests for clarification and more information on Monday.
The routine transfer of funds to debit cards for SNAP recipients at the beginning of each month has been anything but ordinary during the government shutdown. Funding ran dry ahead of Nov. 1, stoking fears among the 42 million SNAP beneficiaries across the country, along with community nonprofits and grocery stores who depend on the business. 
Just in time, on Oct. 31, a pair of federal court rulings in Rhode Island and Massachusetts presented what looked like relief by ordering the Trump administration to tap emergency federal funding to revive the program — first with partial payments, and then, the full amount ordinarily given per recipient per month. By Friday, the money started flowing to recipients; 79,000 Rhode Islanders had received the full monthly payments as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday — a little over half of the 140,000 total beneficiaries in the state — according to McKee’s office. 
A few hours later, the infamous USDA memo ordered states to “undo” payments, warning that the move was “unauthorized.”
Other Democratic governors stated outright they would not comply with the USDA order. Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin summed up his response in a single word, “no,” while Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey challenged President Donald Trump to a legal fight, declaring “we will see him in court.” 
Even Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, who like McKee has attempted to walk the line between condemnation and conversation with the federal administration, said he would not pull back the SNAP payments already distributed to Connecticut residents, according to news reports.
McKee’s moderated response mirrors his administration’s messaging toward Trump through most of the year — critical, but not bombastic.
“I think it’s in keeping with his relative unwillingness to sort of play the fighter against the Trump administration for lack of a better word,” Adam Myers, an associate professor at Providence College, said in an interview Monday. “Some governors really thrive on that and are trying to make a national name for themselves. That hasn’t really been [McKee’s] approach.”
Myers also sought to distinguish the SNAP funding fight from other battles states have led against the Trump administration for overstepping federal authority on immigration policies, public health, and education, among others. By contrast, federal food assistance has historically been propped up entirely by federal dollars, with states acting as program administrators.
“Intergovernmental programs like food stamps make it difficult for voters to hold government accountable because they don’t know which level of government is at fault,” Myers said.
McKee, who is already facing a stiff reelection battle next year, made clear the blame lies with Trump and the USDA’s “whipsaw memo.”
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, the former CVS executive who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, criticized the governor in a statement Monday afternoon.
“As Governor, I would refuse to take back SNAP benefits from families who are counting on them to feed their children,” Foulkes said. “This is a president who was trying to make people go hungry as a bargaining chip and I will use every legal tool available to protect Rhode Islanders from President Trump’s harmful attacks.”
But finger-pointing offers little assurance for the low-income Rhode Islanders who depend on the federal food assistance program to afford groceries each month.
The back-and-forth continues to play out in court — both the U.S. Supreme Court and a separate case being heard in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate advanced a short-term funding bill Sunday night that includes full funding for SNAP.
As of Monday, full payments appear to still be available for Rhode Island SNAP beneficiaries, said Kate MacDonald, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Food Bank. The Rhode Island Department of Human Services, which administers the program on behalf of the state, did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
La Familia Meat Market in Providence’s Silver Lake neighborhood, which accepts EBT cards,  saw fewer shoppers last week and over the weekend, cashier Maria Hernandez told Rhode Island Current on Monday afternoon. The bodega was quiet except for the hum of fluorescent lights and refrigerators.
“They already don’t have that much money, now they can’t even put anything on their (EBT) cards,” she said in Spanish. 
But 500 feet down Pocasset Avenue at Chapines Market, shoppers were seen ordering cuts of meat and picking up plantains from one of the fruit crates near the entrance.
“It’s more or less the same here,” said cashier Evelyn Quiroa.
Local food pantries and soup kitchens reported surges in clients in late October, suspecting the increase was because people were trying to stock up ahead of the loss in monthly federal food assistance.
Meanwhile, questions and concerns about food assistance flooded the phone lines for United Way of Rhode Island’s 211, a 24/7 service provider line. The nonprofit reported 970 calls in total within the first week of November — 30% higher than the typical volume, Michael Cerio, a spokesperson for United Way, said in an interview Monday. Questions specific to food pantries were up 250%, while calls seeking information about the latest guidance on SNAP rose 157%, Cerio said.
Call data does not reflect in-person interactions through United Way’s outreach services. The nonprofit regularly sends employees to community service locations, including food pantries, to educate, answer questions and help people apply for federal food assistance.

The state Supreme Court held that the LAPD went too far in advising people about those penalties when they file citizen complaints.,"In summary
California adopted criminal penalties for filing false claims against police officers 30 years ago. The state Supreme Court held that the LAPD went too far in advising people about those penalties when they file citizen complaints.


A warning that people see before filing complaints against Los Angeles police officers creates a barrier to free speech, the California Supreme Court ruled today in a long-running lawsuit over the language.  
The high court ruled 6-1 in favor of the city of Los Angeles and against the union that represents its police officers in finding that the admonishment describing penalties for filing false has the potential to deter “citizens from filing truthful (or at least not knowingly false) complaints of police misconduct”.
The warning exhibits “numerous characteristics that, considered together, sufficiently burden a protected form of speech — namely, truthful (or at least well-intentioned) complaints of police misconduct — so as to warrant heightened constitutional scrutiny,” Associate Justice Joshua Groban wrote in the majority opinion. 
The ruling turned on a 1995 law that sought to create consequences for false claims against police officers: Anyone filing a complaint against an officer could face criminal charges if they knowingly sign a false report.
At the LAPD, officials went further, demanding that complainants affirm, in bold font and all capital letters, that they understand the potential penalties. 
“IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU KNOW TO BE FALSE,” the LAPD form reads. “IF YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE, YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE.”
The court found that the warning is biased in favor of the police because witnesses who make false statements in defense of an accused officer would face no charges for lying. 
“While the Legislature had a legitimate and significant interest in remedying the harmful effects of abusive false claims of police misconduct, (the law) is not narrowly tailored to meet those objectives,” Groban wrote. “Instead, the statute establishes an ill-defined, asymmetrical criminal provision that is accompanied by an unusual admonition requirement.”
The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing LAPD officers, argued that the form is constitutional and necessary to prevent false complaints that would tie up an officer’s career.
The decision reversed a California appellate court ruling in this case and a 2002 California Supreme Court decision in a related case, both of which agreed with the police union that the warning passed constitutional muster.
California law is now in line with multiple federal court rulings, which found that the warning violates the First Amendment.  
In a dissent, Associate Justice Goodwin Liu said the law and the warning are “no more unconstitutional than laws that make it a crime to commit perjury, file a false police report, submit a false document to a public agency, or lie to a government official concerning an official matter.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/020725_NUHW-Kaiser-Permanente_JWH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

It’s the least Miller could do for two guys who wore, and wear, their love of Waterloo as proudly as the stars on their shoulders.
As a result of donations of cash, labor and materials, two permanent tribute monuments to U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Evan “Curly” Hultman and Brig. Gen. David Cole will grace veterans’ memorials on either side of the Cedar River downtown.
The monuments are to be simultaneously dedicated and unveiled at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 11, Veterans Day, in a ceremony utilizing both sites and the adjoining Fourth Street Bridge.
Miller headed up the effort as a member of the Veterans Memorial Hall Commission. He estimated the total value of donations in cash, labor and materials at between $20,000 to $30,000.
But the exact dollar amount doesn’t matter to him.
“It’s worth a million bucks to me,” Miller said. “It’s just amazing for me to think that it’s all happened and put together and to think that their legacies are there forever.” He hopes the monuments generate visitors locally and beyond and draw even more attention to the other adjacent veteran memorials.
Hultman, a World War II veteran who worked his way up from the enlisted ranks to head U.S. and NATO reserve officer associations, will have his monument at Soldiers and Sailors Park outside Veterans Memorial Hall. He passed away in February at age 99. He would have turned 100 this past July 15.

Cole is a 1963 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., and served two tours in Vietnam. He turns 85 this month. His tribute marker will be at the Black Hawk County Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Paramount Park, just across the river from Memorial Hall.
Each will have a stone pedestal with their likenesses and accomplishments cast on brass plaques. The project, approved by Waterloo Leisure Services Commission which oversees city parks, as well as the Memorial Hall Commission, was first announced in August, as detailed in a previous “View from the Cedar Valley” column.

The completed monuments will be dedicated and unveiled at a ceremony at 10 a.m. Tuesday, beginning at Veterans Memorial Hall. Cole is returning from Virginia for the event and also will speak at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Grout Museum District’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum.
Following the ceremonies at Memorial Hall, attendees may gather at either of the memorials to Cole or Hultman. An honor guard will fire a rifle salute and play “Taps” from the Fourth Street Bridge, spanning the river between the two parks, after which the monuments will be simultaneously unveiled.
Promoters of the event, including Hultman’s daughter, retired U.S. Army Col. Heidi Warrington, say the bridge ceremony also will be a symbol of community unity, since Hultman and Cole were from rival high schools from opposite sides of the river — Hultman from Waterloo East High, Cole from Waterloo West High. And ironically, each of their memorials are on the opposite sides of town from where they grew up.
In addition to cash donations for the brass castings and other expenses, labor and materials were donated by Wayne Magee Construction of Cedar Falls, Midland Concrete Products of Waterloo and self-employed father and son masonry contractors Chris and Jaeger Borcherding.
“I’m overwhelmed,” Miller said. “Without the volunteers to guide this, people that stepped up to do this, going above the call of duty to do this … you can’t thank them enough.”
Miller has noted that Hultman and Cole distinguished themselves in civilian and military life as is denoted on their monuments.
Hultman served as Iowa attorney general, U.S. district attorney and headed U.S. and NATO-affiliated reserve officers organizations. He played a key role in working with officers of former Warsaw Pact nations in the 1990s and bringing those nations into NATO following the fall of the Soviet Union under the “Partnership for Peace” program. Cole had a long successful post-military career in the communications industry with America Online and Sprint. He also taught at West Point during his military career.
Hultman, a 1943 graduate of Waterloo East High School, who received his law degree from the University of Iowa, was very involved in the relocation and construction of the present Becker-Chapman Waterloo American Legion Post 138. He also was honorary fund drive chair for the consolidated Waverly Area Veterans Post in nearby Waverly, when the veterans posts there put up a combined rebuilt post after the 2008 flood. He has also co-sponsored many exhibits and events at the Grout Museum District’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum and supported and performed at fundraisers for Cedar Valley Honor Flight.
Cole, a 1959 graduate of Waterloo West High School, was a featured speaker at the Waterloo Exchange Club’s “Healing Field” observance in 2007, honoring those fallen since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He has personally greeted, in full dress uniform, every Honor Flight of Waterloo veterans visiting Washington, D.C., near his Virginia home since those flights began in 2011.
Cole has noted that, like so many local Vietnam veterans of his generation, it is especially poignant that his tribute marker and the county Vietnam memorial is at Paramount Park, the site of the old Paramount Theater, of which they have many fond memories from their youth. All Black Hawk County residents killed or missing in action in Vietnam are listed on the marker, including one posthumous Medal of Honor recipient, Robert J. Hibbs of Cedar Falls.

THE INDUSTRY GROUP group representing all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts fired a warning flare up to Beacon Hill last month when it published a detailed report likening the budget woes municipalities face to a “perfect storm.”  
But how did communities get to this point? What kind of solutions do they want to see, and what would that mean for taxpayers?  
This week, The Codcast hosts a panel discussion unpacking municipal finance issues with a trio of guests: Massachusetts Municipal Association Executive Director Adam Chapdelaine, Amesbury Mayor Kassandra Gove, and Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Executive Director Paul Craney.  
The report from the Massachusetts Municipal Association found that unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns has dropped over the past two decades once adjusted for inflation, forcing communities to foot the rising bill for services with budgets that are constrained by a cap on property tax increases.  
In Chapdelaine’s view, the current crisis is a mix of longer-term factors that have been building for decades and the “incendiary pressure of significant inflation” in recent years.  
“It is a little bit of a mix of things that have been in place for a long time but have likely intensified, and some other things that have had more ebbs and flows that are now just ebbs in the wrong direction,” he said.  
That has big implications for constituents. Municipalities are responsible for K-12 schools, local police and fire departments, public works, libraries, and other important services.  
“There’s this friction for the taxpayer that their taxes are going up and they’re paying a lot here, but they are getting less for that dollar,” Gove said.  
In Amesbury, officials pursued a $6 million Proposition 2½ override, asking voters to hike property taxes in exchange for restoring cut educator positions, preventing public safety cuts, and stabilizing budgets for upcoming years.  
The measure failed, with about 58 percent of votes in opposition. (This episode of The Codcast was recorded before the election.)  
Prop 2½, a law voters approved in 1980, limits the amount that cities and towns can increase property taxes each year. It’s landed back in the spotlight in recent weeks, especially after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu called for repealing the measure.  
The law still has some vocal supporters, though, including Craney.  
“Prop 2½ is the reason why people can afford to stay in Massachusetts,” he said. “It’s one of the hallmark pro-taxpayer laws in the entire country. It’s so well-regarded and esteemed that other states are told to go do Prop 2½ as a model.”  
On this episode, guests debate how much of the strain is a result of recent developments and how much stems instead from structural factors (6:35), assess the history and future of Proposition 2½ (13:30), and consider who has the power to solve the problem (26:40).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;quality=80&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

Phil Murphy granted 48 people pardons or shortened sentences, bringing his clemency total to 217 since June 2024.","Jamal Muhammad thanks Gov. Phil Murphy for commuting his prison sentence at a Princeton University ceremony on Nov. 10, 2025. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)PRINCETON — Gov. Phil Murphy pardoned 29 people and commuted the prison or parole sentences of 19 others in his fourth round of clemencies Monday, promising he’ll do more before he leaves office in January.
With Monday’s clemencies, Murphy, a Democrat, has now granted 217 pardons and commutations since his clemency initiative launched in June 2024. That’s more than New Jersey’s previous governors have done in the past 30 years combined.
“We can, and we must always, stand as the state for second chances, a state that serves as a model for restorative justice across our entire nation,” Murphy said to a packed room of smiling supporters at Princeton University.
Those in attendance included Jamal Muhammad, who had been sentenced to life in prison with 30 years of parole ineligibility for a 1996 robbery in Atlantic City that turned deadly when his co-defendant shot the victim. Murphy commuted his sentence in April, after he’d been behind bars for 28 years. Since he left prison, he has gotten married, started a business, and started teaching at his mosque.
Monday, Muhammad hugged Murphy and thanked him “a million times” for his freedom.
“Life and freedom have been full of blessings,” he said. “Just to be in a mall, at Great Adventure, at the movies, at a bodega, just to take a walk to Wawa is a miracle. I appreciate each heartbeat, each footstep, every breath.”
Thousands of people have applied for the governor’s mercy through a state board that advises Murphy on executive clemency actions. Some applicants get expedited consideration, including non-violent offenders with long post-conviction periods of good conduct, domestic violence victims whose crimes were related to their victimization, or people convicted at trial whose sentences grossly exceeded pre-trial plea bargains.
Bishop Joshua Rodriguez, the advisory board’s chair, conceded the work is “never simple.”
“Our responsibility is to look beyond an individual’s past mistakes, and consider their entire life, their past actions, their present character, and their future potential to contribute positively to society,” Rodriguez said.
Clemency is essential to ensure true justice, he added.
“Mercy is too often mistaken for weakness, but today, we see it for what it truly is, moral strength in action,” he said.
Muhammad echoed that sentiment, saying he left behind many people in prison who have reformed since their convictions.
“Commutations are very important and very essential. Because we’re human beings and we’re not God, we make errors. We miss the mark at times. It happens,” Muhammad said. “Even the judicial system sometimes, periodically, sporadically, respectfully, has missed the mark. Maybe some people didn’t get their fair result through the court.”
Murphy pardoned Brenda Thompson’s convictions for drug and property crimes dating back to 2000 that she said she committed to support her addiction. She now works as a peer recovery specialist for a Camden-based nonprofit.
“This clemency represents more than a pardon. It represents restoration, redemption, and renewed purpose. I am committed to using this second chance to serve others,” Thompson said.

About 50 Princeton University students have helped Murphy’s effort by volunteering over the past year to research case documents, interview applicants, prepare legal memos, and file petitions under a clemency project sponsored by the university’s School of Public and International Affairs. Some of them were on hand Monday to cheer the latest round. Of 32 applications they have filed, Murphy granted clemency to two of them Monday.

People pardoned in this latest round had been convicted of everything from shoplifting to arson, while those commuted included 14 people convicted of murder or manslaughter and five sentenced to non-homicide felonies, including robbery and kidnapping.
Clemency recipients included:

Laciana Sears, who was sentenced to 22 years for killing her abusive husband. Her sentence was commuted to 10 years.
Calvin Bass, who was 14 when he went to prison for murder. He was released from prison in 2021 after serving 38 years behind bars, and he has testified in Trenton to urge legislators to set a minimum age for juvenile delinquency. His parole supervision was commuted and will end in June 2026.
Timothy Harris, who was 18 in 1992 when he shot a woman during a robbery in Newark and got sentenced to prison for life with 30 years of parole ineligibility. He had unsuccessfully pressed the courts to show the same mercy to young adult offenders that they have ordered for minors convicted of crimes. He will be released from prison and be placed under parole supervision for five years.
Rasool McCrimmon, who refused a seven-year plea bargain stemming from a 2004 murder in Newark and was then sentenced to 50 years in prison, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, whose attorneys represented him. He will be released on parole.

Western states in the Colorado River basin are racing a federal deadline to hash out the beginnings of an agreement governing the overtapped river. As the clock ticks down, two questions loom large: Just how real is this deadline, and what does it mean for California?


The clock is ticking down to a federal deadline Tuesday for California and six other Western states to reach the broad strokes of a deal portioning out supplies from the parched Colorado River. 
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal stewards for the river under the Department of the Interior, have threatened to impose their own plan if the states can’t agree how to manage the river after 2026, when the river’s current rulebook expires. 
Dire projections that another dry year could send the basin’s major reservoirs plummeting to alarmingly low levels have ramped up the urgency, and the tensions. 
But, after two years of fraught negotiations, the states remain at an impasse. Those in the river’s lower basin — California, Arizona, and Nevada — are clashing with Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico upstream. A key point of contention is how much each basin must scale back their use of the overtapped river as climate change further squeezes supplies. 
“We’ve been in a holding pattern, and we need to land this plane by Tuesday,” J.B. Hamby, California’s chief negotiator as chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, told CalMatters. 
California’s dependence on the Colorado River raises the stakes. The state takes more than half of the power generated at Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam, and more water from the main stem than any other in the basin. Half a million acres of alfalfa, winter vegetables and other crops in the Imperial Valley all rely on the Colorado River, which also supplies urban Southern California via the Metropolitan Water District. 
But California has also been relatively impervious to shortages on the river, with senior water rights long seen as bulletproof. Now, the questions hanging over the last days of negotiations are — how real is the threat of missing the deadline? And what exactly would the consequences be for California?
Blown deadlines on the Colorado River
For decades, federal officials have threatened to intervene if states in the Colorado River basin fail to reach agreement. The threat — and the inevitable lawsuits water suppliers fear would follow — have motivated major deals that now govern the river’s operations. 
Actual federal intervention is far rarer — though the U.S. government has stepped in in the past, on a smaller scale. 
In the early 2000s, Southern California was forced to stop using surplus Colorado River water when other states began clamoring for their fair share. The Interior Department set a deadline of December 31st, 2002 for California’s water agencies to cut a deal weaning themselves off the surplus water, or face immediate cutbacks.  
The Imperial Irrigation District — by far the biggest user of Colorado River water in California — balked. So the Interior Secretary cut California’s supplies, leading to court battles and, ten months later, a deal. 
But deadlines and threats seem to have lost their teeth in recent years, when states in the Colorado River basin have blown deadline after deadline, with little federal response. 
Last week, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs urged the Trump administration to be more assertive. “As we approach critical deadlines, we need the Trump administration to step in, exert leadership and broker a deal,” she said in remarks prepared for a water conference. 
Elizabeth Koebele, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said negotiations may have become too contentious for deadlines to matter. She attributed it to fracturing relationships between the basin states as devastatingly dry conditions on the river ratchet up the stakes. 
“We have less water, and it’s caused more rippling problems,” Koebele said. “You’re cutting a smaller pie, for more people.” 
A strike against storage
The Veteran’s Day deadline isn’t the final deadline; it’s an interim milestone as federal officials race to lock in a plan before the current rulebook expires.
Scott Cameron, now acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, said at a conference in June that in the absence of a deal, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was prepared to take charge as water master. The position gives him the power to declare the river in shortage and call for cutbacks in the lower basin. 
But the Trump administration declined to specify what exactly it might do. “At this stage, all parties should remain focused on the difficult but necessary work required to reach a seven-state agreement,” an unidentified Interior Department spokesperson said, in an emailed statement.
If there is still no plan by late 2026, the rulebook could revert to one from the 1970s, according to an analysis by Arizona State University’s Kyl Center for Water Policy.  
That worries Metropolitan Water District’s Bill Hasencamp, because it would upend Metropolitan’s ability to continue banking water in the Colorado River basin’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the country, for dry spells. 
The water giant imports water from Northern California and from the Colorado River to supply 19 million people in six Southern California counties. 
Right now, Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River resources at Metropolitan, says that the district has socked away about 1.5 million acre-feet of water in the reservoir over the last 20 years. It’s enough to supply 4.5 million households for a year. 
Metropolitan saves Colorado River water in Lake Mead when water from Northern California reservoirs is abundant, and draws on these stores when state supplies dry up. But, under the 1970s-era rules, suppliers would no longer be able to add water to this savings account. Metropolitan would need to use its banked stores over the next ten years, or risk losing the water. 
Hasencamp estimates that banked water could disappear more quickly if California faces greater cuts.
“Under a new regime, the feds — if things get dry enough — could cut us back,” Hasencamp said. “We could access that storage, but we might need it to offset cuts on the river that could come to us. So it’s a very undesirable situation.” 
Ultimately, experts agree that the most undesirable situations, and the greatest risks to the basin states, will likely come from nature itself. 
The Colorado River is in the grips of a megadrought; Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Institute, called August’s projections for reservoirs Lake Powell and Mead “beyond awful.”
Udall said the latest projections for the reservoirs remain dire. One scenario shows “both Powell and Mead entering uncharted territory by (the) end of Water Year 2026,” Udall said in an email. 
“That’s the new reality,” Cameron, the acting head of Reclamation, said at a meeting in Arizona over the summer. “There are real risks to both the lower basin states and the upper basin states if we don’t collectively do something differently than we’ve done in the past.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/120522_Colorado-River-Canal_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Photo by Getty Images)Low-income Hoosier families are expected to have access Tuesday to partial benefits from the SNAP federal food aid program.
The Indiana governor’s office made the announcement Monday even as the Trump administration was fighting court orders to restore full SNAP funding and Congress worked toward a deal for ending the federal government shutdown, including fully funding the food aid benefits.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office said SNAP benefits for November should be available on EBT, or Electronic Benefits Transfer, cards on Tuesday.
The state will be able to “move quickly to deliver full benefits to qualifying households across Indiana as soon as possible” once a new federal spending deal is approved, the governor’s office said.
“After weeks of gridlock, it’s good to see some folks in D.C. finally come to their senses,” Braun said in a statement.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said last week that it was recalculating benefit allotments to 274,000 SNAP households in the state. Benefit changes made by federal officials for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, will reduce the maximum amount to a household by at least 50%.
The calculation of a household’s partial SNAP benefit for November involved subtracting 30% of a household’s monthly net income (after allowable deductions) from the maximum allotment, according to the FSSA. That process could lead to some households not receiving any November benefits.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ebt-1024x650.gif,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 21:17:53+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT plans $500M in relief for federal programs, but questions remain",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/ct-plans-500m-in-relief-for-federal-programs-but-questions-remain/,Gov. Ned Lamont outlined plans to protect federal human service programs. But it remained unclear how far Connecticut will spread the money.,"Gov. Ned Lamont outlined plans Monday to reserve $500 million in state funds for imperiled federal human service programs while reaffirming his pledge to preserve November SNAP benefits.
But it remained unclear how far Connecticut will spread that fund, equal to one-fifth of last fiscal year’s historic $2.5 billion surplus.
Will it only safeguard services jeopardized by the federal government shutdown, which could be ending soon? Or will it also offset permanent cuts imposed last July by Congress and President Donald Trump? 
Among those cuts are new SNAP working requirements that could leave about 36,000 Connecticut residents without aid between Dec. 1 and March 31.
“We’re here to announce a Federal Emergency Relief Fund,” Lamont said during a late morning press conference, noting the $500 million would be used to bolster the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, other food aid, heating and energy assistance grants and other human service initiatives. “I’m really pleased that we’re able to come to this position and give citizens of Connecticut some confidence and comfort. We’re there. We’ve got your back.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, one of several legislative leaders who joined Lamont at the announcement, predicted the fund would enjoy strong bipartisan support when the state legislature comes into special session on Wednesday and Thursday. He particularly praised House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, for publicly urging the use of state funds to roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents who would continue to receive SNAP benefits.
“In Connecticut,” Ritter added, “you have a culture where people of all parties said, ‘Enough is enough.’”
Legislators are expected to vote Wednesday and Thursday to create a short list of federally funded social programs — involving nutrition, health care, energy assistance and more — that Lamont could add to, drawing from this $500 million response fund. 
Most of the rest of that $2.5 billion surplus will be used to pay down state pension debt, though portions already have been assigned to increase the rainy day fund and to boost a long-term effort to increase child care statewide.
Under the legislation expected to be adopted in the special session, only the governor could recommend specific appropriations from that response fund, legislative leaders said, but a panel of the six highest-ranking state lawmakers — including four Democrats and two Republicans — could block any expenditure with a simple majority vote. 
The fund would expire when the regular 2026 General Assembly session starts Feb. 4, and any unused dollars would also be used to pay down pension debt.
CT officials hopeful that shutdown ends soon, but nothing’s certain
State officials said they assume the federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1 will be over well before early February but conceded little about that saga is easy to predict.
An end appeared in sight around 1 p.m. Friday, when the Trump administration announced federal funding for food assistance would resume immediately — even though the president still was fighting states’ efforts in federal court to secure funding.
But later that day, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the federal government to pause any further payments. In addition, the Trump administration ordered states on Saturday not to provide full SNAP benefits for November.
Connecticut did not follow the directive, and Lamont said the state will cover the entire cost of SNAP benefits for November, about $72 million, if necessary, using this new fund lawmakers will create this week.
Meanwhile, the shutdown appeared to be nearing an end Sunday when eight Democratic U.S. senators broke ranks and agreed to support a temporary federal funding resolution. Congressional leaders said votes could happen early this week, The New York Times reported.
Democrats, who are in the minority on Capitol Hill, had been united against adopting a new federal budget unless Republicans restore health insurance subsidies set to vanish Jan. 1.
That subsidy cutback represents an estimated $340 million annual hit to Connecticut residents who buy insurance on the state’s health exchange.
“I’m very hopeful that the feds are going to come up with a solution that doesn’t penalize our people,” Lamont said. But he added, “I can’t make any predictions about the federal government.”
Will Lamont use CT dollars only to temper pain of fall shutdown?
If the shutdown ends soon, the lion’s share of the $500 million emergency reserve fund would still be intact.
Even if the Trump administration is allowed to penalize Connecticut for using state funds to support SNAP, the $72 million in monthly program costs represents just one-seventh of the fund.
The state is advancing smaller sums of money to replace stalled federal funds in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — and in a key winter energy assistance program. But Washington already has indicated it will reimburse states for any funds they advance to keep both initiatives afloat during the shutdown.
But the General Assembly, where Lamont’s fellow Democrats are in the majority, began planning a state emergency response fund to offset federal cutbacks last June — almost four months before the federal shutdown.
State legislators had anticipated problems not only from a federal budget standoff but from a major package of federal program cuts that were debated by the GOP-led Congress in early June and passed on July 1.
Those cuts directly affect about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who no longer meet new, stricter work requirements for SNAP benefits. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
And that won’t be changed by the federal shutdown ending.
“As of right now, Connecticut is well-positioned to make sure that these hardships are just going to be dealt with,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Lamont, who committed state funds Friday to restore SNAP benefits that Washington had stalled seven days earlier, drew criticism from legislative leaders from both parties who wanted him to act sooner.
Would the governor use the state response fund to help groups harmed by last July’s federal program cuts, such as this portion of the SNAP population?
“I think it’s something we’re looking at,” he said, adding that he also would explore options to work with federally qualified health centers to assist households losing health insurance premium subsidies.
GOP leader cautions Lamont not to exceed his authority
But even if he appeases his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly and does more to backfill vanishing federal funds for human service programs with state dollars, he could annoy Connecticut Republicans in the process.
GOP leaders here support using the state surplus to ease temporary pain caused by the federal government shutdown. But when Washington cuts social programs permanently, the Connecticut GOP says, state government should be wary about stepping in.
And if Connecticut wants to spend more to pick up services Washington is dropping, Lamont and the General Assembly should find offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget, they say.
“Obviously there’s a leap of faith here,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who also attended Monday’s press conference. “We are putting $500 million into the hands of the governor to mitigate this crisis, and we need to make sure that he is doing just that.”
Candelora already was rankled Friday when the governor committed state funds to support SNAP after legislative leaders from both parties had spoken in favor of the concept but before lawmakers formally had voted to create the response fund.
“Unless the governor thinks he’s filed paperwork to run for king of Connecticut, that’s not possible,” Candelora said Friday.
Lamont countered Monday that “timing is important,” and action was needed Friday.
“Look at how desperate people were last week,” he said. “Look at the lines. They’re like bread lines from the Great Depression. People were scared. I wanted to do everything I can to give them confidence.”
Candelora added he remains supportive of a response fund to address human service programs harmed by the shutdown but warned that if Washington resolves that issue before Wednesday’s special General Assembly session begins, more Republicans may vote against it.
“I helped craft this plan, and so I support it,” he said. “But I will just say, if the federal government reopens, I certainly can understand why Republicans will say this fund is no longer necessary.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2324-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Department of Corrections has not received a request from the federal Bureau of Prisons to move Tina Peters from state prison into a federal facility, despite reported calls from advocates and government officials to do so.
Peters, the former Republican clerk for Mesa County, was found guilty last year on state charges for orchestrating a plan to breach her office’s secure election systems in order to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is incarcerated in a state facility in Pueblo.
Since then, right-wing political figures have repeatedly called for her release. Most recently, that included Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who appealed to President Donald Trump on X to “free Tina Peters” following the president’s pardons over the weekend to dozens of people connected to the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney, replied “We are working on it!” to a Sunday night post on X about Peters and her potential release.

The president can only issue pardons, however, to people with federal convictions.
Others, including longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, have floated the idea of transferring Peters from a state prison to a federal facility. A conservative website, Just the News, reported last week that the Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent an email to the head of the Bureau of Prisons to research how Peters could be transferred to a federal prison and send a request to Colorado for a transfer into federal custody.
A partially redacted copy of the email shared by Just the News showed an unidentified DOJ official ordering the BOP to “explore any and all avenues within BOP’s authority to seek and request” Peters’ transfer to a federal facility.
Colorado Newsline was unable to independently verify the existence of that email.
But CDOC has not received any written request from the BOP about the issue, according to department spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez.
Here’s the list of newly pardoned Trump fake electors, other allies

Any transfer of someone incarcerated in a state prison to another jurisdiction, Gonzalez said, is initiated by the state, not an outside entity.
“This process is typically reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs,” she wrote in an email. “This protocol requires a formal assessment by a multidisciplinary team and a multi-step internal review. Any such transfer must be reviewed and formally approved before any incarcerated individual can be referred to another jurisdiction.”
In an interview with Bannon on Monday, Martin said the Trump administration had been “fighting for two months to figure out a path on Tina Peters.”
“We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say you want something, you change your tune.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in a statement that he would oppose any effort to transfer Peters.
“Tina Peters is in state prison because she committed crimes that put the safety of our elections at risk. She was prosecuted and convicted by a jury of her peers for illegally tampering with our election system and violating her duty,” he said. “There is no basis for the Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody. Any scheme to prevent her from being held accountable under Colorado law is outrageous.”

The man, Alan Alterisi, died in May 2018 at age 58 after undergoing surgery at UConn Health’s John Dempsey Hospital. He had been incarcerated since 1997. 
The complaint, filed by Alterisi’s sister Sally Walsh earlier this year in Hartford Superior Court, alleged that four doctors working in the Department of Correction had failed to adequately provide medical care for Alterisi over the course of several years, by not recommending further testing despite his ongoing symptoms. 
In an internal investigation completed after his death, a nurse consultant for the state, Marci Ouellette, said there were “missed opportunities” to identify Alterisi’s internal bleeding and treat it before it got to the point where it was unmanageable. Ouellette said that if Alterisi had received the necessary treatment from the DOC staff, “he likely would not have died on May 25, 2018.” 
A 2023 memo from DOC Director of Security Antonio Santiago also noted that a third-party review of Alterisi’s case had found “deviations from the professional standard of care, policies, and accepted medical standards.”   
In August 2017, Alterisi was found to have a spleen so enlarged that it was considered “high risk for rupture.” In February 2018, he reported having “black tarry stools.” But the nurse consultant’s report noted that he was never given the standard test used to detect blood in stools, and he was not referred to a specialist in gastroenterology. 
The report shows that Alterisi had complained of nausea, vomiting and frequent abdominal pain. He was anemic. Although he was scheduled to attend two medical appointments in late March and early April of 2018 at John Dempsey Hospital, he refused both times, saying he wasn’t able to “sit on a bus or sit at UConn all day.” At the time, he was in custody at Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers.
On May 4 of that year, he went to UConn’s John Dempsey Hospital in severe pain and vomiting blood, with dark stools. It was discovered that he was bleeding internally in his gastrointestinal system. Although he underwent surgery, he died on May 25. 
Ouellette wrote in an email in October 2021 that she believed a doctor who saw Alterisi in February of 2018 had “dropped the ball,” and that “he should have done something.” 
In a court hearing this week, Assistant Attorney General Kelly Deann Neyra argued that the case should be dismissed because a medical doctor who wrote a letter testifying to the DOC medical staff’s failures to properly care for Alterisi practiced in a different specialty than the doctors who treated Alterisi. Medical malpractices cases like this one require that plaintiffs submit testimony from outside medical professionals.
Neyra said this particular testimony didn’t satisfy the requirements for a medical malpractice suit. 
In the unnamed doctor’s letter, dated Jan. 31 of this year, the author said he was board certified in preventative medicine and that he worked as a primary care doctor and medical director in “correctional settings” in Vermont, Washington, Maine, Florida and Ohio. Neyra argued that because the doctor was not a specialist who practiced in internal medicine, he did not have experience treating peptic ulcer disease.
She also said the state’s claims commissioner was incorrect to have allowed the case to proceed against the state. The state has sovereign immunity from medical malpractice lawsuits unless the claims commissioner authorizes the lawsuit.

Ken Krayeske, the attorney representing Sally Walsh, argued on Monday that peptic ulcer disease could be treated by general practice doctors in a correctional setting, and said the physician who wrote the letter did the same job that the four doctors implicated in the lawsuit had done. 
Beyond specific medical malpractice claims, the lawsuit also alleged “institutional malpractice” against the Department of Correction as a whole, claiming that the department, which at the time was working in a partnership with UConn Health, suffered from budget shortfalls, inadequate staffing, delays in care and a lack of oversight.
The Department of Correction terminated its partnership with UConn Health in 2018. 
Walsh told the Connecticut Mirror on Monday that the Department of Correction needed to admit wrongdoing in her brother’s case. She said it felt as though she was fighting a battle. 
“ These people here and the DOC, they need to all admit they screwed up,” she said. “My brother suffered. He suffered.”  
DOC Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said in a statement that the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.
Krayeske said during the hearing that he was appalled that the state of Connecticut had not offered an apology for its role in Alterisi’s death. “I want a government that takes responsibility when it kills people,” he said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Calls to retain South Dakota’s current math standards continued at the state Board of Education Standards meeting Monday, as opponents flagged a proposed rewrite of the standards as overly simplistic.
The state Department of Education received 44 comments on the new standards as of Friday, most of which were critical of some or all of the rewritten standards. Department officials presented the board with a revised proposal during the Monday meeting at the Sioux Falls Ramkota hotel, addressing some concerns in the submitted feedback.
The proposed standards were reviewed by a 20-person revision committee earlier this year after being developed by a statewide advisory group. South Dakota Secretary of Education Joe Graves said the proposal leaves core concepts largely unchanged but describes them more clearly and concisely.
Graves told board members that the current standards are “incomprehensible” to some — especially parents and elementary school teachers. It’s important for parents and primary educators to understand the standards so they can help support students and build a foundation in mathematics, he added.

All of the opponents who spoke against the standards on Monday were higher level math educators with specializations in the field.
Sharon Vestal, a math professor at South Dakota State University and president of the South Dakota Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said she was concerned the simplification removes clear language from the current standards, which could lead to new educators not teaching material students should know because it’s not explicitly laid out.
Stephanie Higdon is with the Center for the Advancement of Math and Science Education at Black Hills State University. She worked with the state Department of Education when it surveyed school districts with higher math test scores prior to Graves’ appointment as department secretary. Those “bright spot schools,” she said, taught more closely to the current math standards.
“The current math standards are not broken when teachers believe in their students, believe that they can meet these standards and receive the support to do so,” Higdon said.
Gail Jacobsma, a math teacher at Arlington, said the current standards aren’t perfect, but “are quite good.”
SD Education Department encounters criticism of proposed math standards

“For schools like mine, which have enviable math scores, they are vital,” Jacobsma said. “They provide a detailed, coherent map for us to follow and help ensure that the instructional materials we purchase are well aligned.”
The proposal pulls from other states’ standards across the nation, and from the Archimedes standards, which the conservative-leaning National Association of Scholars says are “depoliticized”: “No ideologies permeate the problems and tasks, no ethnomathematics guides the pedagogies, and no tangential applications have been inserted that politicize math.” The Archimedes standards were written by an assistant professor at Hillsdale College in Michigan, which was also involved in South Dakota’s revised social studies standards, accepted in 2023 after a lengthy and controversial process and implemented this school year.
Graves added that South Dakota students “lack significant progress” on math testing since the COVID-19 pandemic, which he attributed to the current standards. About 44% of students were proficient or above on the state test annually over the last five years, he said. 
Department officials presented South Dakota’s latest report card to the board at the Monday meeting, showing that math proficiency remained at 44%. English and reading increased by one percentage point to 52% proficiency.
Health standards also discussed; next meeting is in February
The board is also considering an update to South Dakota’s health education standards.
Two South Dakota advocacy groups requested board members amend the standards: the South Dakota Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association wants to include caregiver education for students as Alzheimer’s diagnoses increase in the state, and Call to Freedom wants to include abuse and human trafficking education for students.
Graves cautioned board members against adding more topics to the standards and encouraged organizations to work with local school districts to arrange instruction.
Some board members disagreed with Graves, suggesting the state should recommend additional health-related topics for schools.
The board will meet again on Feb. 23 in Pierre to take more public comment on the proposed math and health standards.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Though the U.S. Senate has taken steps toward resolving what has become the longest federal government shutdown in history, some current and former Democratic leaders in Maine are calling on members of their party to hold the line. 
Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Maine’s congressional delegation has been divided in its approach to the short term spending deal, with U.S. Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden splitting over the initial bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the Senate, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King has consistently voted with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and other Republicans for the stopgap plan, which did not include an extension of health care subsidies that Democrats have been pushing for.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said late Sunday that he would hold a separate vote on the credits no later than the second week of December. But such a deal would also require a vote in the U.S. House, and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has made no such commitment.
On Monday, Pingree, who represents the 1st Congressional District, said she will keep fighting to secure “a real solution” before the U.S. House takes up the Senate proposal in a vote slated for later this week.
“A ‘deal’ that lets enhanced Affordable Care Act credits expire, which will drive premiums higher for families already stretched thin, fails the millions of families counting on us to keep their health care affordable,” she said. “That is not a compromise. It is capitulation.”
After the vote Sunday, Gov. Janet Mills wrote on social media that tens of thousands of Mainers are facing rising health care costs because of President Donald Trump and Collins, who helped lead negotiations as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee and who Mills is challenging in the November 2026 election after she terms out as governor.
“Maine people deserve affordable health care — not just the promise of a vote that won’t go anywhere,” she wrote on X. “Fight back.” 
Collins, on the Senate floor, encouraged her colleagues to back the legislation and end “the unnecessary harm to the security of our families and our nation.” She said, “We must not delay any longer.”
Another Democratic Senate candidate, Graham Platner, similarly said that increasing health care premiums can “destroy families” in eastern Maine. 
Putting blame squarely on the U.S. Senate minority leader, Platner said, “This happened because Chuck Schumer failed in his job yet again because they do not understand that when we fight, we win. When we hold the line for working families, for working people, we win.”
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is vying to fill Mills’ open seat in the Blaine House, called it a “terrible deal.” 
“If they can’t stand up now when the Constitution is in tatters, seniors and kids are hungry and industries are on the brink of disaster, when will they? Where’s the fight?” she wrote in a social media post. 
Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, who is also in the running for governor, said the Democratic and independent senators who voted with Republicans Sunday are “making a huge gamble.”
“But they aren’t gambling with their own health, they are gambling with yours,” Jackson said. “Mainers and Americans deserve better.”
Late Sunday, King joined the handful of Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance the spending bill in a press conference during which he cast doubt on the effectiveness of the shutdown to win support for the tax credits. 
Rather, he said the almost seven weeks of “fruitless attempts” had only caused harm for federal workers and recipients of federal food assistance. 
King said he believes the vote Sunday night moved them closer to a vote on the ACA tax credits, citing Thune’s promise to bring a Democratic health care bill to the floor.
But Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Ryan Fecteau doubted the reliability of congressional Republicans promising to hold the December vote. 
“I’ll stand corrected if this somehow pans out, but I think Senator King’s deal is as thin as November ice on a Maine lake — it’s gonna fall through,” he wrote on Facebook.
State Auditor Matt Dunlap, who is the only Democrat currently in the running to replace Golden, who announced last week that he won’t seek reelection next year, said “we can do better.” 
“This deal gets us nothing,” Dunlap said, noting that the point of the Democrats’ stand was to preserve the tax credits. “A vague promise of a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act is laughable from a Republican majority that has made repeal of the ACA one of their highest priorities as they protect their rich friends in the insurance industry.”
Golden was the only House Democrat to back the initial proposal in the House. On Monday, a spokesman for the congressman said he looks forward to continuing bipartisan conversations in the coming days about how to build support for extending the tax credits and preventing massive price increases.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday took up a Republican-backed challenge to counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
Depending how the justices rule, the case could be consequential for states that vote by mail.
It stems from a lawsuit against a Mississippi state law allowing mail-in ballots received within five business days after Election Day to still be counted. Roughly 30 states have similar laws, with varying grace periods.
The decision could also have ramifications for next year’s high-stakes midterms, which will decide whether Republicans maintain control of both the U.S. House and Senate. The court will likely hear arguments and rule by mid-2026.
A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state’s law, ruling the state’s statute isn’t preempted by federal law, which says Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
But a federal appeals panel sided with the law’s challengers, the Republican National Committee and the state’s Republican and Libertarian parties. The appeals judges cited the U.S. Constitution’s clause that gives states the power to regulate elections, but also noted that clause says “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.”
President Donald Trump, in his first term, appointed the three judges who issued that decision.
The legal question now is whether “election day” is when voters cast their ballots, or also when they must be received. The appeals court decided that ballots aren’t cast until election officials get them.
While the ruling doesn’t apply in Washington, if the Supreme Court upheld it, the ballot-counting system here would also be thrown into question.
Mississippi officials appealed to the Supreme Court to protect their five-day grace period. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, wrote in a brief to the high court that the appeals decision “would require scrapping election laws in most States.”
“The stakes are high: ballots cast by — but received after — election day can swing close races and change the course of the country,” Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote.
The law’s opponents say these measures “deprive the electorate of a clear nationwide deadline that ‘puts all voters on the same footing.’”
In the 2024 general election, Washington election officials received nearly 120,000 valid ballots after Election Day that were postmarked on time.
Attorneys general  from other states filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to side with Mississippi. They note the appeals court decision “jeopardizes the ability of military service members and their families stationed abroad to have their timely cast ballots counted.”
President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting.
In a March executive order, for example, he urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop states from counting absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in federal elections.
The Supreme Court is already grappling with other litigation focused on mail-in ballots.
Last month, they heard arguments in the case of an Illinois congressman who sued over a law in his state counting ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day. That case deals with the more procedural issue of the standard plaintiffs must meet to be allowed to sue over an election law.

Both people have sought asylum in the United States, claiming they are fleeing persecution in their home country.
In recent months, hundreds of people alleged to have entered the country illegally have been jailed by Homeland Security. Immigration judges, citing a new Trump administration interpretation of a longstanding federal law, have then denied those detainees hearings at which they could have argued for their release on bond while their deportation case was pending.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That has resulted in dozens of detainees suing the federal government, as well as the county jails where they’re held, in U.S. District Court, arguing their due process rights are being violated.
In the vast majority of those cases, district court judges have sided with the detainees, ordering immigration judges to schedule bond hearings for the detainees.
Two such cases were recently decided by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa.
Iowa woman cites Mexican drug cartels
One of the two cases involves Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.
Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.
On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail to be detained at least until a hearing that is scheduled for Dec. 19, 2025.
An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing, citing the Trump administration’s new interpretation of laws related to the detention of individuals for possible deportation.
Reyes took the matter to U.S. District Court, suing Muscatine County Jail Administrator Matt McCleary, as well as DHS, ICE, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and DHS Director Kristi Noem.
On Nov. 3, 2025, Locher ruled in favor of Reyes, noting that the overwhelming majority of courts around the nation have rejected the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law as somehow requiring mandatory detention without the opportunity to argue for bond.
Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.
In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher noted he “would not be ordering any particular outcome on bond or detention. Rather, (Reyes) simply would be entitled to her statutory and due process right to a hearing.
“This means the immigration judge will have the authority — as immigration judges have for years — to evaluate (Reyes’) history and circumstances and make an individualized decision. If public safety or some other appropriate factor warrants detention, she will remain in custody. If not, she will be released on bond. Either way, there is no meaningful harm to the government from having to follow principles of due process.”
Des Moines man ‘fleeing persecution’ in Colombia 
In a separate case, Locher sided with Saider Santiago Helbrum, 26, who came to the United States in May 2024, alleging he was fleeing persecution in Colombia. After entering the country, he was detained briefly by U.S. Border Patrol and then released on his own recognizance, eventually settling in Des Moines.










It has been difficult to stay healthy or hopeful without seeking my family or feeling fresh air. I miss my wife very much.


– Saider Santiago Helbrum


In January 2025, he filed an application for asylum. In July 2025, with that application still pending, he was arrested and jailed on a simple-misdemeanor charge of fifth degree theft after being accused of stealing groceries at a WalMart store. Santiago Helbrum argued his store receipt, as well as bank records tied to the card he claimed was used to pay for the groceries, show the items were paid for.
Within three weeks, the theft charge was dropped, with the Polk County Attorney’s Office stating that “after examining the records, talking to the witnesses, and taking all other factors into consideration,” it was declining to prosecute the case in the interest of justice.
In the meantime, however, Homeland Security had taken custody of Santiago Helbrum and, after the theft charge was dropped, DHS continued to have him held at the Polk County Jail under a detention order. An immigration judge then denied Santiago Helbrum’s request for a bond hearing.
After Santiago Helbrum took DHS and Polk County Jail Administrator Cory Williams to federal court, he explained to a judge the effect that three months of detention had on him.
“My time in jail has been physically and mentally exhausting,” he wrote in an affidavit filed with the court.  “When I first arrived, I felt ill and experienced nosebleeds and a burst blood vessel in my eye. It has been difficult to stay healthy or hopeful without seeking my family or feeling fresh air. I miss my wife very much. It pains me and worries me that I have not been able to support or care for her and our family for the past few months.”
In court filings, lawyers for the DOJ cited a provision of the Laken Riley Act that calls for detention in cases where a person “is charged” with a crime. The DOJ argued that an arrest on a theft charge triggers the requirement for mandatory detention — and that the subsequent dismissal of the charge had no effect on that requirement.
Locher disagreed and ordered the immigration court to provide Santiago Helbrum with a bond hearing, stating in his ruling that “after charges are dismissed it is no longer accurate to say that a person ‘is charged’ with theft.”
Prior to the judge’s ruling in the case, Williams, the Polk County jail administrator, had filed papers with the court indicating his office took no position in the matter.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)State lawmakers convened Monday for a second special legislative session in Santa Fe to approve up to $162 million in state funds aimed at providing food benefits for New Mexicans through mid-January. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the session Thursday amid a federal government shutdown and ongoing legal wrangling between President Donald Trump’s administration and federal judges who ordered him to pay full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits to roughly 42 million Americans, including about 460,000 New Mexicans, for November. 
The chaos continued over the weekend, with the United States Agriculture Department ordering states to award only 65% of the federal benefits for November. If states had already paid out the full amount, the USDA ordered states to “immediately undo” that action.
Then on Sunday evening, seven United States Senate Democrats voted along with Republicans to set in motion the government reopening. 
Even with a potential end in sight, New Mexico Democrats in the legislative majority said Monday they need to fully fund the program on which more than one in five New Mexicans rely. House Democratic leaders stressed in a news conference ahead of the session that if the full federal funding comes in, the legislation allows them to immediately stop spending state funds. 
The bill contains roughly $192 million in appropriations. That includes up to $162 million intended to pay for SNAP benefits until at least Jan. 20, which is when the Legislature meets again for the regular 30-day session. 
The legislation provides for weekly SNAP payments of approximately $20 million a week to pay for SNAP benefits until then. Recipients will get a payment once a week on their Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, according to House Democratic leaders said in a news conference. 
In addition to the $162 million for SNAP, the legislation appropriates $30 million to the state disaster fund, money that the governor already spent to pay for 10 days’ worth of SNAP benefits between Nov. 1 and Nov. 10. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), addressing colleagues in the Senate chamber, defended the Legislature spending up to $162 million for SNAP even with signs of a breakthrough in Congress. 
“While that certainly is a positive thing, we are here to act and that be sure and to be sure that New Mexicans have access to food,” Wirth said, adding that both chambers and Trump still need to approve a deal to reopen the government. 
Leaders predicted a one-day special session, which will cost taxpayers $75,000, with both chambers voting quickly to approve the legislation. 
As of 1:38 p.m. on Monday, one chamber had already approved the bill. The House voted 52-9 in favor, following minimal debate. The bill the House voted to advance was amended to include a new $50,000 appropriation to study the state’s administration of SNAP. 
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Finance Committee continued debating the bill Monday afternoon. Assuming they pass it, it will head toward the Senate Floor.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3009-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 16:05:53.813500

Washington is one of a handful of states that conduct elections by mail and ballot drop boxes. The state accepts mail-in ballots up until the day before certification, which is 21 days after the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. 
Ballots for this month’s elections in Washington are still being counted, and the results of some close races have flipped and narrowed during the past week.
A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state’s law, ruling the state’s statute isn’t preempted by federal law, which says Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Scientists from universities across Iowa urge a shift to more renewable energy sources and updated building standards to cope with insurance premiums that are mounting due to a changing climate.
Nearly 180 researchers and educators signed the 2025 Iowa Climate Statement, released Monday, which points to rising temperatures and “destructive” weather events as key drivers of rising insurance premiums.
Global temperatures in the past decade have been the hottest 10 years of the past 175 years, according to research cited in the statement. These rising temperatures, combined with the expectation that patterns of drought and flooding will persist, will continue to cause growing insurance costs, according to the statement.

Peter Thorne, University of Iowa distinguished chair in the Occupational and Environmental Health department, said insurance providers are using “advanced climate models” to “align their rates and anticipated losses.” 
Thorne said states like Florida, Texas and California that have seen increased instances of hurricanes, flooding and wildfires have caused drastic increases in premiums. According to a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, some regions of these states had average annual premiums in 2023 of more than $4,000. 
The climate statement said while Iowa’s rates have been driven up due to building, labor and reinsurance costs, climate change has “amplified” these costs. 
Last year, Iowa was rated as one of 15 states with a “mounting insurance crisis.” Events like the 2020 derecho that hit Iowa and parts of the Midwest combined with persistent tornadoes and smaller-scale derechos have all contributed to the increase in premiums. According to a 2024 report, home insurance premiums in Iowa increased 14% from 2023 to 2024.
Insurify predicted home insurance rates would increase 19% in Iowa in 2025.
The Iowa Climate Statement says “we must work quickly to reduce our reliance on coal and oil” and instead shift to more wind and solar energy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and “minimize future climate related property damage.” 
Researchers on a call with members of the media Monday morning said in addition, Iowa lawmakers can strengthen building standards to ensure buildings are built “not just quick and cheap” but with materials that will better stand up to fire, hail and flood damage. 
David Courard-Hauri, a professor of environmental science and sustainability at Drake University, said hailstorms in Iowa have contributed to higher insurance premiums and lower insurer coverage on hail-related claims, which means consumers have to pay more out of pocket on those claims.
“If we can reduce those damages by building for the current world, we can certainly save a lot of money,” Courard-Hauri said. 
The scientists said homeowners can also make some upgrades to their homes, like installing more durable shingles or better insulation, that can lower insurance premiums and prevent serious damage.
Crop insurance 
The changing weather patterns are also hurting farmers, who sometimes have to replant crops in the spring due to flooding, only to lose some of the crops in the summer due to drought. 
Thorne said farmers are “especially vulnerable” to exacerbated climate disasters. The cost of crop damage due to climate disasters, he said, is also passed along to taxpayers because crop insurance is subsidized by the federal government. 
According to USDA data cited in the statement, crop insurance premiums were $15.8 billion in 2024 and $9.8 billion of that was subsidized. 
“Farmers and taxpayers will be required to pay the increased costs of more extreme weather events in the future,” the statement said. 
Thorne said farmers are saddled with additional premiums to protect things like equipment and grain storage, which can also be impacted by climate disasters. 
“This all points to the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming and increasing insurance premiums,” Thorne said.

When Burlington author Bill Mares died after a cancer diagnosis, his wife, friends and neighbors finished his latest and last work, “2050: Vermonters Take a Swipe at the Future.”

The late Burlington author Bill Mares had yet to be diagnosed with cancer when, two autumns ago, the 83-year-old received a call from Jeff Danziger, a Dummerston friend and nationally syndicated political cartoonist.
“I remember Bill sitting here by the fire,” Chris Hadsel, Mares’s wife of 53 years, recently recalled, “and, next thing we knew, Danziger was suggesting a book about what Vermont’s going to be like in the future.”
No one foresaw how the resulting essay collection — “2050: Vermonters Take a Swipe at the Future,” set for release this weekend — would arrive with a bittersweet backstory.
In his lifetime, Mares — a beekeeper, brewer, history teacher, journalist, legislator, marathon runner and traveler to more than to 60 countries — could boast to publishing 20 books on everything from a 1,200-mile camel trek across Saudi Arabia to “Real Vermonters Don’t Milk Goats,” a 1983 humor collaboration with University of Vermont professor Frank Bryan that sold 70,000 copies (or one for every 10 residents).
Danziger saw his book suggestion as a follow-up to his 2017 teaming with Mares on “The Full Vermonty: Vermont in the Age of Trump,” which featured 20 collaborators ranging from former Gov. Madeleine Kunin and Vermont Life magazine editor Tom Slayton to Weybridge writer Julia Alvarez and the late Brookfield artist Ed Koren.
But Mares, who had endured open heart surgery just before Donald Trump was first elected president, was reluctant to step back into the pain of politics.
“Bill felt he’d been there and done that,” Hadsel said. “He did not want this book to be consumed by the vicissitudes we thought were coming, the ups and downs, the crisis of just yesterday that now nobody can even remember because there’s a whole new one.”

Instead, Mares wanted to springboard forward a quarter century by inviting friends to share their thoughts about Vermont in the year 2050.
“This is not a book that solves Vermont’s problems,” Hadsel said. “A couple of the essays are fanciful or fun, some are worried, but none of them are gloom and doom. There’s a common theme of hopefulness and faith that Vermonters will stick together and figure out how to work around the change that’s coming.”
In the book, Vermont Gas Systems CEO Neale Lunderville, a gubernatorial appointee under Republican Jim Douglas and Democrat Peter Shumlin, proposes the idea of a state “reboot” through better housing, schools, business opportunities and infrastructure.
“Vermont’s future is in the strength of its communities,” Lunderville writes. “Real prosperity comes when every town, and every person in every town, has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
Jen Kimmich, co-founder of Stowe’s Alchemist Brewery, expresses hope that all future residents will be embraced, regardless of whether they were born in the state like herself.
“In 2050,” Kimmich writes, “every Vermonter, those of us with families that have been here for generations and those of us just arriving, should be celebrated for our experiences, appreciated for our contributions, and welcomed for being here.”
Mark Breen, senior meteorologist at St. Johnsbury’s Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium, calls for a disclaimer on any long-term forecasts.
“Considering how changeable Vermont weather has always been,” Breen writes, “it should be no surprise that we might see almost any kind of weather, in any season of the year.”
Mares faced his own storm clouds in the spring of 2024 when he was diagnosed with terminal lymphoma. Stuffing his friends’ essays into a shoebox, he focused on finishing a memoir — “Better to Be Lucky than Smart!” — that he published five days before he died July 29, 2024, through use of the state’s medical aid-in-dying law.
“I feel in better shape than most and more grateful than all that I had the chance to drive the bus of my own disappearance,” Mares told VTDigger podcaster David Goodman a week before his death.
Hadsel, inheriting three-dozen forward-looking essays, was left without a book title, introduction or illustrations — just her husband’s wish that she and neighbor Jane Smith, a former Vermont journalist, finish the work. 
They reached out to Rootstock Publishing of Montpelier and frequent Mares collaborator Don Hooper of Brookfield, the latter who had toted his sketchbook to Chicago as a Vermont delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
“Don sent me a doodle of an old codger who looks like Bill waving a pen that’s spearing a piece of paper,” Hadsel recalled. “I looked at the picture and said, ‘Aha!’”
That scrawl is the book’s cover illustration and inspiration for its “Take a Swipe at the Future” subtitle.
Hadsel is set to debut the 140-page paperback Saturday at the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum before joining essayists for readings Sunday at Stowe’s Alchemist Brewery, Nov. 18 at the Charlotte Public Library, Nov. 20 at Montpelier’s Kellogg-Hubbard Library and Nov. 25 at Burlington’s Phoenix Books.
Former Gov. Howard Dean, quoted on the back cover, hopes the collection “will inspire people to take action.”

Free.,"Here's the list of newly pardoned Trump fake electors, other allies",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/heres-list-newly-pardoned-trump-fake-electors-other-allies,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced on Monday he pardoned his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other people allegedly involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, but the president's federal pardon does not shield members of the group from state charges.Posting to social media early Monday, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin released the names of 77 people for whom Trump signed federal pardons in a proclamation dated Nov. 7. Martin is an attorney who represented several people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. After losing the 2020 presidential election, Trump goaded his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol and stop Congress from certifying the election results. He was later impeached by the House for a second time, in connection with the insurrection, but the Senate acquitted him.It’s the latest move from the president, following his return to the White House, to absolve anyone involved in the efforts to overturn or challenge former President Joe Biden’s victory. The proclamation notes that pardons were granted to address “a grave national injustice.”Those on the list include former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was indicted along with Trump in a Georgia election case to overturn the state's results in the 2020 presidential election. The proclamation, which is only for federal charges, is symbolic and does not prevent state-level prosecutions. Many of the people named on the list were alleged to have been part of the fake electors' plot to submit fraudulent certificates claiming that Trump won the battleground states of  Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, instead of Biden.The White House did not respond to States Newsroom's request for comment. ‘Pardoning a conspiracy’A coalition of more than 100 pro-democracy groups, Not Above the Law, condemned the move by the president to pardon people involved in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election.“Trump isn't just pardoning people – he's pardoning a conspiracy and trying to rewrite history,” according to the coalition. “He's creating a two-tier justice system where he and his allies operate above the law.

As New Mexicans, we know what it means to take care of each other. When our neighbors are struggling, we help them. That’s why our state leaders stepped in to make sure families could still get food during the appalling and unprecedented suspension of SNAP food benefits. And that’s why the Trump administration’s choice to block SNAP during a government shutdown, despite having the emergency funds, struck such a deep nerve—it’s not just cruel, it’s unnecessary.
When the shutdown ends, many federal workers and families will finally get some relief. But that relief won’t last long. The truth is: even after the government reopens, the cuts to food and healthcare programs will keep coming, and they are about to get worse.
Buried in the details of H.R. 1 — the federal budget bill pushed by House Republicans — are huge cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and marketplace health insurance. These cuts will hurt hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans, ripping away support that keeps our families stable and healthy. These are not temporary disruptions caused by a funding gap — these are long-term structural changes designed to take away food and healthcare from our families.
New Mexico’s federal lawmakers aren’t staying quiet. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, along with Representatives Melanie Stansbury, Teresa Leger Fernández, and Gabe Vasquez are fighting to protect food assistance and healthcare, and rural clinics that are lifelines in our communities.
In New Mexico, we’ve seen what works. When families have access to healthy food, healthcare, and stable housing, our whole state is stronger. We’ve made progress in recent years: expanding child hunger programs, improving access to affordable healthcare, and creating state initiatives that keep working parents on their feet. That progress is now under direct threat from Washington DC.
As our lawmakers prepare for the upcoming 30 day legislative session, protecting that progress must come first. Lawmakers must continue the important work that began in October’s special session: building state-level solutions to shield New Mexico families from the harshest effects of H.R. 1’s cuts. That means investing in our state food assistance programs, protecting healthcare coverage, making sure rural hospitals and clinics are funded, and ensuring no child in New Mexico goes hungry.
We don’t have to accept a future where federal politics decide who in our communities eats, who gets medical care, or who is left behind. The values that define New Mexico — community, resilience, and compassion — are stronger than any budget cut.
The shutdown will end. But our responsibility to one another will not.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/snapposter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 16:05:53.813500

Meadows, a former congressman, served as Trump’s chief of staff in the aftermath of the 2020 election.
Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney, posted the full list of people pardoned by Trump on social media Sunday night. It does not include Trump himself, but does name Meadows and another North Carolina native — attorney Sidney Powell, who led challenges to election results in key states as part of Trump’s legal team.
Trump’s pardon proclamation says it “ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 presidential election and continues the process of national reconciliation.”
Meadows and Powell are not accused of any federal crimes, rendering the pardons largely symbolic. They were both indicted as part of the Georgia investigation into the electoral scheme, which is still pending in state court. (Meadows asked to have his case moved to federal court; that request was rejected.)
Prior to his role in the White House, Meadows represented the western 11th district in the U.S. House, chairing the Freedom Caucus and growing to be one of the president’s closest allies during his first term. He has regularly made appearances on Fox News in recent months defending Trump and the administration.
Meadows and his wife were also investigated over allegations that they voted improperly in 2020, using the address of a mobile home in Macon County. They were not charged.

Javitz Federal Building on July 1, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)A Utah lawmaker wants the state to join California in barring immigration agents and other federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces while they detain people. 
“It seems like good policy that if you’re a government agent, people should know you’re a government agent,” said Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek. 
Blouin said Friday the measure is needed to make it harder for imposters to pass as agents so they can rob or attack people, like in recent cases in North Carolina and Philadelpia. He believes it would also ensure officers who overstep the bounds of their authority or injure people are held accountable.
He said there would be exceptions for undercover officers and likely for certain times where they might wear masks for medical or tactical reasons. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not reply to a request for comment Friday, but says on its website that its “officers wear masks to prevent doxing, which can (and has) placed them and their families at risk.”
The site says all ICE officers “carry badges and credentials and will identify themselves when required for public safety or legal necessity.”

Democrats in Congress and in statehouses in New York, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan have proposed similar legislation. 
The ACLU is working with Blouin on the Utah measure. Ellie Menlove, the organization’s legislative and policy council, said the move could strengthen trust between law enforcement and communities.  
Blouin said he’s still in the early stages of crafting the bill and under no illusion it will succeed or even get a public hearing when the Utah Legislature, which has a Republican supermajority, convenes in January.   
“If anything, it’s about sending a signal that we expect better out of federal law enforcement here in Utah,” Blouin said. 
Also at issue is the question of whether the state can enforce a mandate on federal law enforcement agencies. 
Blouin noted his Republican colleagues have asserted states’ rights in the past, pushing back against what they see as federal overreach. In 2024, the Legislature passed a law setting up a process to reject directives from the federal government they see as unconstitutional. 
Sen. Todd Weiler, a Republican who chairs a legislative panel on law enforcement and criminal justice, said he has concerns about harassment and threats to ICE agents whose identity is revealed. Weiler, of Woods Cross, said he believes the measure would not hold up in court. 
“It’s not the role of the state to tell federal agents or federal agencies how to do their jobs,” Weiler said. “That’s just not our role.”
He went on to say, “I think in a perfect world they shouldn’t be wearing masks. But we don’t live in a perfect world.”
Utah immigration attorney Christopher Vizcardo said he hasn’t seen any masked ICE officers when he’s dealt with the agency, and he usually knows who the officers are because Utah has a small number of agents.  
“I think more transparency is not a bad thing,” Vizcardo said of Blouin’s bill. However, he added,  “it’s hard to enforce that against federal officers. Our system doesn’t really allow for that.”

National Domestic Violence Hotline: People who have experienced domestic abuse can get confidential help at thehotline.org or by calling 800-799-7233. 
The immigrant from India believed her husband when he said that if she wasn’t gone by the time he got to their Georgia home in 10 minutes, he would kill her. 
She said her husband and his family, who are also immigrants, abused her throughout their marriage, beating her with a belt, pouring hot water on her, cutting her, and pushing her head through a wall. 
“Several times I tried to escape, but they found me and brought me back home,” said the woman, who is in the country illegally and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is afraid being identified would harm her chances of gaining legal status.
With no time to run after her husband’s call in July 2020, she dialed 911, even though she knew she could be deported. The police arrived to find the husband threatening her with a knife in front of their young children, she recalled. He was arrested but not prosecuted, she said.
The woman and her children sought services from the Tahirih Justice Center, a national nonprofit organization that serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. She is still winding through the immigration process five years later.
Besides immigrants’ increased vulnerability to sexual violence, they face a host of mental health and physical challenges, researchers say. They have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and anxiety, according to a 2024 study.
“Personally, I know anxiety related to the current political climate is precipitating expensive emergency room visits and negatively impacting people’s ability to get to work and make a living,” said Nicole E. Warren, a nurse midwife and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore.
Immigrants without legal status also face increased rates of chronic conditions and higher death rates from preventable diseases due to their limited access to health care and their fear of seeking it, advocates say.
“One of our clients was so afraid to leave her home that she avoided seeking medical care during her pregnancy, out of fear of interacting with ICE,” said Miriam Camero, director of client advocacy, social services, at Tahirih. 
Food banks have reported that many immigrants in need of food assistance have stopped coming, for fear of deportation. 
It has always been difficult for people without legal immigration status to get help when they need it. The Trump administration’s crackdown on people in the country illegally has intensified the pressure. The situation has also hampered the advocates and attorneys who defend their rights. 
“We’re working extra hours to do all the work,” said Vanessa Wilkins, executive director of Tahirih’s office in Atlanta. “The safety planning and added protection that clients might need, including documents just to make sure they are safe, can definitely make you feel overwhelmed.” 
U Visas
For domestic abuse survivors without legal status, like the woman from India, going to the authorities seems more fraught amid the immigration crackdown, said Maricarmen Garza, chief counsel of the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.
“There are just no guarantees,” Garza said, “especially with how law enforcement is intertwined in enforcing immigration law.” 
In more than half of states, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can collaborate by formal written agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove people in the country illegally. Advocates say this can interfere with victims’ efforts to get a certificate to file for a “U visa,” which would allow them to live and work in the U.S. with the possibility of lawful permanent residency.
The battered woman from India recalls police telling her that if she did not press charges, she could get a certificate for a U visa. She agreed to their suggestion but recalls the anxiety of filing about five abuse reports over two years to get the certificate. “I got panic attacks just writing them down, because it meant I was reliving the situations again,” she said.
When asked for comment about the difficulties immigrant domestic violence victims face, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson touted President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “The president’s successful effort to deport criminal illegal aliens is making all victims safer and ensuring they will never again be harmed by dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement. She said “allegations without evidence” that immigrants have been told to drop charges “should not be taken seriously.” 
Immigrant women without legal status can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of language barriers, as well as cultural and social isolation, researchers have found. 
According to a 2023 report, lifetime rates of abuse by intimate partners range up to 93% in some immigrant groups, compared with about 41% of U.S.-born women experiencing such abuse in their lifetime.
As the Trump administration reshapes the country’s immigration system, survivors of violence who entered the country illegally have a tough time proving their abuse and trauma to get relief, advocates say.
A refugee health and asylum program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore provides immigrant victims of abuse with free forensic evaluations to support their claims for humanitarian relief, including applications for U visas.
Warren, the program’s associate director for women’s health, said that in the past, a written affidavit of the clinic’s findings was enough to corroborate an applicant’s legal accounts of past trauma.
“Now, we are getting requests for our in-person testimony,” Warren said.
Application Backlogs
The woman from India applied for a visa after she received a certificate from law enforcement allowing her to do so in 2023. Hers is one of nearly 11.6 million pending visa applications, according to data through June — the highest volume of cases ever recorded by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of pending U visa applications is 415,000, according to the agency.
Only about 10,000 U visas are issued per year, and it can take more than seven years to process applications, Garza said.
Adding to the pressure, the Trump administration has reduced the availability of Section 8 housing, which helps low-income individuals and others pay their rent. As of September, people without legal authorization to be in the United States are not eligible to receive rental help over U.S. citizens.
“If Tahirih wasn’t behind me, I could be homeless,” said the woman, who said she can afford only half her rent.
Victims’ advocates say they are working harder than ever to support their clients but are stretched thin as they face federal funding cuts and increased demand. 
The Tahirih center reported a 200% increase in call volume in the four months after Trump took office, compared with the same period last year.
“At the end of the day there are a lot of emails and a lot of people we aren’t able to reach as quickly as in the past,” said Casey Carter Swegman, the center’s director of public policy.
To reach immigrant survivors of abuse who are afraid to come forward, advocates are “getting back to basics,” said Joanna Otero-Cruz, executive director and president of the Philadelphia group Women Against Abuse. 
“We’re doing grassroots outreach to hairdressers and other small-business owners,” she said. “They’re the eyes and ears for us.”
In Riverhead, New York, a 38-year-old woman who emigrated from El Salvador said she has twice been the victim of domestic abuse but was too scared to report it to police. 
She said the second assault was by a man for whom she cooked and cleaned in his home. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of her sense of shame and her fears of deportation, said he raped her, took pictures of her naked, and threatened to put them on social media if she tried to go to the police. He then stalked her, she said.
Noemi Sanchez, Long Island regional coordinator for the Rural & Migrant Ministry, a nonprofit that supports farm workers, is working closely with the woman to elevate her self-esteem and help her understand that “no woman deserves to have a man mistreat them.”
Meanwhile, the survivor from India received a temporary work permit in 2024 and is employed as a certified nursing assistant, which “helps me survive,” she said.
“I have really come a long way,” she added. “It wasn’t easy. I had great support behind me. They didn’t let me down.”

But consider this: car haulers full of Chinese-brand vehicles might someday roll across the Ambassador Bridge and the soon-to-open Gordie Howe Bridge in Detroit from Canada.
That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon. Former President Joseph Biden slapped a 100% tariff last year on Chinese electric vehicles that President Donald Trump has continued. Canada also has in place a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.
But Canada is rumored to be considering removing that tariff as part of a broader effort to build trade relationships with China and other Asian countries in response to Trump’s foolish trade war against our formerly friendly northern neighbor.

Both Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney were in Asia at the same time recently seeking investments.
Relations between the two countries, already testy, further deteriorated after Ontario produced a U.S.-aimed television ad featuring former President Ronald Regan extolling the virtues of free trade.
The ad ran briefly during the World Series, in which many Americans were rooting for the Toronto Blue Jays to defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Trump was so incensed by the ad that he called off trade negotiations with Canada and said he was slapping an additional 10% tariff on Canadian-made goods coming into the U.S. Trump attacked the ad as “fake” and said in another one of his down-is-up moments that Reagan “loved tariffs.”
Canada is heavily dependent on trade with the U.S. so it’s not surprising Carney is seeking new partners if America no longer wants to play ball.
But Michigan’s economy could be a big loser if Canada succeeds spurning the state for new trading relationships with Asian countries.
Canada is Michigan’s largest trading partner. The state exports more goods, worth in excess of $23 billion a year, to Canada than any other country.
A recent statewide poll conducted for the Detroit Regional Chamber found that nearly 60% of Michigan voters think putting tariffs on Canadian goods is bad for the state’s economy.
“They believe tariffs are increasing their costs, hurting the state’s auto industry, and that placing tariffs on Canada hurts Michigan,” said pollster Rich Czuba, who conducted the survey.
Already, goods-carrying truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest U.S.-Canada crossing, is down by more than a third so far this year from 2024. Truck traffic on the Bluewater Bridge at Port Huron is off by 6.7%.

Retailers and other businesses in the state’s border communities of Detroit, Port Huron and Sault Ste. Marie say they are seeing fewer Canadian customers, who appear to be boycotting U.S. shopping and entertainment venues.
Trump doesn’t seem to care. He has often said that the U.S. doesn’t “need anything” from Canada, including the 1.8 million cars and trucks Canada annually exports to the U.S. Many of those vehicles are built in plants owned by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis.
The president wants those Detroit automakers to close their Canadian plants and move production to the U.S., part of his plan to cripple the Canadian economy and make it the 51st U.S. state. Canadian leaders bluntly say that will never happen.
Detroit automakers appear to be responding to political pressure by Trump.
GM and Stellantis recently slashed production of several models in Canada, prompting the Canadian government to limit the number of vehicles the two automakers can ship to our northern neighbor tariff free.
That move adds to worries by Detroit automakers that the USMCA free trade agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term and has mightily benefitted Detroit, might not survive. The agreement comes up for review next year and prospects for extending it are unclear.
Maintaining the USMCA “can create an even stronger North American trading bloc, ready to compete with China at every turn,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, which promotes Michigan’s auto industry.
But Canada, facing the potential loss of significant Detroit Three investment, is looking to partner with China to possibly replace it and the more than 100,000 direct auto jobs that investment supports.
Removing the 100% tariff could also allow China, which has massive production overcapacity at home, to export vehicles to Canada before establishing production there.
If Canada drops its tariff on Chinese cars, it could gain a significant advantage over the U.S. and Mexico in giving China an opening to the North American market. Mexico, long seen as the most logical entry point for Chinese cars, is planning to raise its tariffs on Chinese vehicles from 20% to 50%.
Experts and even many auto industry executives say that it’s just a matter of time before American consumers are able to buy Chinese vehicles, particularly EVs where China dominates. And a study released earlier this year by AutoPacific Inc. found that nearly 60% of car-buying Americans under 40 would seriously consider a Chinese vehicle.
Trump’s trade war might result in the unintended consequence of those vehicles entering our market through Canada—an existential threat to tariff-weary Detroit automakers.

(Photo courtesy of Leslie Rubin/WCHS)A massive search operation is underway for a coal miner who was trapped after water flooded a Nicholas County, West Virginia mine over the weekend. Rescue crews continue to focus on removing the water as quickly as possible after diving teams made multiple rescue attempts. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey said all resources, including national experts, have been made available to rescue crews at the Alpha Metallurgical Resources’ Rolling Thunder mine.
“We’ve been doing whatever we can. There is nothing that we would spare to try to save the life of the miner,” Morrisey said during a news conference Monday.
A mining crew hit an unknown pocket of water Saturday about three-quarters of a mile into the mine near Drennen, Nicholas County Commissioner Garrett Cole said in a Facebook post.
All other miners involved were able to safely evacuate except for the one who is still unaccounted for, Cole said.
“May God’s will be done, but it is our sincere prayer that it is to keep this miner safe and returned to his family, friends and coworkers,” he posted.
MetroNews reported that the flood happened after the seal to an old mine works gave way, but it’s unclear if that is where the water was backed up, leading to the flood. 
Morrisey said there have been concerns with removing water at the same time as dive crews were searching in the mine, so the efforts on Monday were more focused on lowering the water levels.  
“This is a very serious situation dealing with not only the water, but what happens with the gas and the lack of oxygen in an area. And, we also want to make sure we’re protecting the safety of the … divers who are going down there,” he said. 
The governor said that he is working with a number of state and federal agencies as well as the National Cave Rescue Commission to access any available resource to help with the complicated rescue. Specially-trained rescuers are needed to perform the difficult search into the dark and flood mine.  
“I’ve personally been in touch with people around West Virginia and across the country in an effort to try to make sure, if there’s anything humanly we can do to save the miner’s life, we want to do it,” Morrisey said.
The United Mine Workers of America issued a statement about the situation in Nicholas County on Monday, saying, “The coal mining family has suffered two incidents in the last week in West Virginia: a fatality in Tucker County and now a missing miner in Nicholas County. I have ordered our safety experts to the Rolling Thunder mine in Nicholas County to provide professional assistance to the teams working to find the missing miner.”
“The hearts and prayers of the entire United Mine Workers of America family go out to these miners and their families. ” the statement continued.

Rep. Forrest Bennett, who represents most of downtown and central Oklahoma City, said in a Facebook post that he was elected Friday by the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO, a group of 230 labor unions representing over 100,000 workers. He was also sworn in Friday.
Bennett wrote on Facebook that he will be resigning in the “coming weeks.” He did not immediately return a message Monday requesting comment on why his resignation wouldn’t be effective immediately or when he planned to step down. 
“This new role requires me to directly lobby lawmakers, and I can’t ethically do both,” he wrote. “It’s been the honor of a lifetime to represent the good people of the 92nd district, and while my title will change, my commitment to my friends and neighbors never will.”
He said he will be working “full-time for Oklahoma’s unions” as president of the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO. 
“I’ll have more to say about all of this in the next few days, but for now, I’m going to celebrate this hard-fought win,” Bennett wrote. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt has 30 days from Bennett’s resignation to set a special election. A spokesperson did not immediately return messages asking about the date of the special election or if the Governor’s Office has received a letter of resignation.

(Photo by Monica Carrillo-Casas/The Spokesman-Review)SUNNYSIDE, Wash. – Evaristo Salas Jr. said there were days he wasn’t sure he would make it out of prison.
But one thing he did know was that, if he ever got the chance, he wanted to help the youths of Sunnyside, Washington.
Now, with a significant lead over his opponent, Laura Galvan, for a seat on the Sunnyside School Board, he says he’s ready to serve his community.
Galvan didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“I’m surprised and happy about it,” said Salas, who won 61.4% of the vote counted as of Friday. “I put in a lot of work.”
Salas is a consultant for the Grandview School District, where he mentors at-risk students, and a full-time student at Columbia Basin College majoring in social work with a minor in criminal justice. He was 16 when he was wrongfully convicted of shooting 24-year-old Jose Arreola twice in the head in November 1995. He spent 27 years in prison before being released two years ago.
With no compensation for his wrongful imprisonment, Salas continues to fight his conviction and has a lawsuit pending against multiple agencies in Sunnyside, including the Sunnyside Police Department and the city of Sunnyside.
Still, he said his focus now is on the community and on making sure people he will represent have someone they can depend on. He noted that, during the months he spent canvassing, many residents told him it was the first time a candidate had come by their home to talk about a campaign.
He recalled one resident who has been living in Sunnyside for 60 years and said they had never had a one-on-one conversation with any local leaders about their campaigns.
“Having that connection with the community is something that I think Sunnyside is really hungry for, because a lot of the houses I went to, they feel like they don’t have a voice,” Salas said.
Perla Clara, a Sunnyside resident, said she was excited to learn he was leading in the vote. Clara said she grew up with a childhood similar to Salas’ and lived in a high gang activity area.
Seeing him persevere has been inspiring for her, she said.
Clara and her husband, Chase Reiff, a local muralist, are working with Salas to restore community murals that have been covered with gang graffiti.
“I really respect what he’s doing,” Clara said.
Salas has a lead of 89 votes. Since there are only about 800 votes to count in all of Yakima County, that lead should be enough to win.
But Salas isn’t declaring victory, though he’s cautiously optimistic. He is using his free time to prepare for the school board and plans to start work on a mural project next week. He said his idea is to tell a story about history through Aztec and Mayan traditional art for one of the murals near Sunnyside High School.
They also plan to redo another mural near Kiwanis Youth Park, an area known for gang activity.
“I’ve always understood that no matter where you come from, whatever struggle you face in life, or even whatever setbacks you have, that if you’re determined, your intentions are in the right place and you really care about the community you come from, you can make a difference,” Salas said.
“That’s something that just got reinforced with this, and I think it’s something that I’m going to carry with me the rest of my life,” he said.

(Photo via Montana Commissioner of Insurance website)Technology may have been partly responsible for the data breach that may have exposed more than 460,000 Montanans financial and health information, and technology may be part of the answer to keeping compromised information safe, according to the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.
In response to a massive information breach by Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield, announced publicly last month, Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance James Brown has implemented an artificial intelligence tool to help residents navigate protecting their data.
Brown said its the first-of-its-kind solution implemented in response to a case like this.
Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield announced last month one of its vendors had a data breach that lasted for several months, and could have opened up financial information and medical records for anyone who uses it. Montana BCBS is the largest insurance carrier in the state.
Brown’s office said that with that many people affected, and with a range of concerns, the AI tool on the website can help pare down the options and assist residents. If Montanans still need help, they can contact the office. But, the AI tool can also help direct residents to staff members or service providers who can help with specific problems related to the breach.
A spokesperson for the office told the Daily Montanan the agency took steps to make sure that the AI assistant is designed not to become a technology breach of its own.
“The AI assistant is not connected to any sensitive database or systems that contain personal information. It’s designed strictly to provide guidance and resources, not to store or process private data,” spokesman Tyler Newcombe said. “All interaction are encrypted, monitored for security; and run with state-approved platforms that comply with privacy standards.”
In addition to updating the site with new information as it becomes available — the company informed the Commissioner’s office in October, months after the breach was discovered and closed in February — the AI tool allows customers to get helped at any time of the day, not just when the office is staffed.
Brown’s office said the AI-powered tool helps directly answer questions about the data breach, understanding rights, and steps to take to safeguard data. The office is asking that residents don’t share their personally identifying information.
“The assistant is there to walk people through the next steps — for example, how to freeze credit, monitor for identity theft or file an insurance claim — but it doesn’t require or request personal data,” Newcombe said. “If a case requires that level of detail, the AI will escalate the issue directly to a trained staff member.”
Staff members also said AI can help the small staff recognize unattended issues.
“AI allows us to triage questions, identify patterns and route complete cases to staff freeing our team to focus on those who need one-on-one assistance,” Newcombe said.
“This is about taking swift action and setting a standard,” Brown said. “When Montanans are affected, we move fast. Our mission is to protect them—and this new technology helps us do that in real time.”
In addition to the announcement about the breach, several residents have filed a class-action lawsuit over the breach as well.

On Monday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order declining to take up a case seeking to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that granted same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide. 
The case, brought by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, argued that Davis’s First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion had been infringed upon by requiring her to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. One of those couples, David Moore and David Ermold, took Davis to court and were eventually granted $50,000 each, a decision upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in March. The Supreme Court declined both Davis’s petition to overturn that monetary award, as well as the broader question of same-sex marriage rights.  
In Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed relief for the decision, but noted that it would likely not be the last legal threat to same-sex marriage rights or Obergefell. 
“I am relieved for today’s decision reaffirming same-sex couples’ continued right to dignity and protection under the law, but we cannot take those protections for granted,” she said in a press release. “Members of this Supreme Court have already told us they are willing to overturn Obergefell. It’s only a matter of time before they do.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan’s constitution currently has an explicit ban on same-sex marriage, which is not in effect because of the Obergefell decision. If federal courts were to overturn that, the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act would ensure that previous marriages, as well as same-sex marriages in other states, would have to be recognized by the state — but same-sex marriage would become illegal in Michigan. 
Democrats in both the state House and Senate have introduced bills that would put forth ballot proposals to remove that language from the constitution, which if passed would make same-sex marriage legal even if federal courts overturned their decision from a decade ago. 
State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township) introduced a resolution on Thursday to do just that, while state Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) introduced his version in the House in March, just after the appellate court’s decision in Davis’s case. Both specifically cited concerns about a future Supreme Court decision as influencing their decision to introduce the resolutions. 
“Regardless of the outcome of Court action, it’s well past time to remove the discriminatory and, as of now, unconstitutional marriage ban language in our state’s constitution,” Moss wrote in a press release announcing the introduction of his resolution. 
“Today’s victory allows us a reprieve, an opportunity to bring our state Constitution into alignment with the protections our residents are entitled to and have enjoyed for more than a decade,” Nessel’s press release continued. “Now is the time to act.”

,DC,2025-11-10 19:31:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FDA to remove black box warning from hormone replacement therapy drugs,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-remove-black-box-warning-hormone-replacement-therapy-drugs,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it plans to remove warnings from hormone replacement therapy drugs that can be used to address symptoms of menopause, saying the statements are no longer needed. The black box warning, the strongest caution possible from the FDA, was added in the early 2000s after a study from the Women's Health Initiative showed an uptick in rates of blood clots, breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes for women who used certain types of hormone replacement therapy. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said during a press conference the change for estrogen-related products “is based on a robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”Makary rebuked the medical establishment for not putting enough effort into researching women’s health conditions, including menopause. “A male-dominated medical profession, let’s be honest, has minimized the symptoms of menopause, and as a result, women’s health issues have not received the attention that they deserve. More than 80% of women have notable severe symptoms lasting up to eight years. How could the medical establishment get it so wrong for so long?” Makary said. “Women deserve the same rigorous sciences as is used for men.”Study criticizedDepartment of Health and Human Services Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health Director Alicia Jackson said the black box warning on estrogen was based on “the flawed, overgeneralized and misinterpreted WHI study.” Jackson said menopause leads to a series of complicated and often painful experiences for women, including “sleepless nights, derailed careers, painful sex, broken bones and a loss of wellbeing.”Jackson explained that when the level of estrogen drops throughout and after menopause, “a cascade of disease and aging begins.”“A preponderance of data now shows that estrogen, when started early, acts as a protective shield for the brain, lowering risks of memory loss, mental health decline and neurodegenerative disease, even Alzheimer's,” Jackson said.  Makary said women should talk with their doctors and can request their estrogen levels be monitored as they approach the age where menopause typically begins and throughout that years-long process. He said that sometimes doctors can prescribe microdosing for hormone replacement therapy, followed by a half-dose and eventually a full dose as a woman’s estrogen levels decrease over time. Makary didn’t say how many of the companies that produce hormone replacement therapies plan to remove the black box warning but said he expects nearly all will do so. “Companies are, generally speaking, very excited when the FDA tells them they can remove a scary warning on your product,” he said. Review by panelThe FDA’s process for removing the black box warning requirement, Makary said, began with an expert panel earlier this year. The FDA’s subject-matter experts then conducted a “comprehensive review of the literature” and recommended the agency remove the requirement, which Makary accepted. The scientists who were part of the expert panel, he said, have written an article that will be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.President of the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement that he ""commends the HHS leadership for improving the lives of perimenopausal women by making the estrogen products they need more accessible to them.""""The modifications to certain warning labels for estrogen products are years in the making, reflecting the dedicated advocacy of physicians and patients across the country,"" Fleischman wrote. ""The updated labels will better allow patients and clinicians to engage in a shared decision-making process, without an unnecessary barrier, when it comes to treatment of menopausal symptoms. ACOG has long advised clinicians to counsel patients based on an individual’s unique risk factors and treatment goals; this announcement does not change ACOG’s guidance on estrogen therapy.""",,,,2025-11-10 14:57:02.704551

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico on Saturday paid 100%  of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to recipients who normally receive them during the first week of the month, the governor’s office said on Monday.
The benefits were paid following a federal court and U.S. Department of Agriculture order to do so, but prior to a U.S. Supreme Court pause on the lower court order and USDA revised memo to “undo” the payment of full benefits.
Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits.
In response to questions from Source NM on Monday regarding the federal government’s revised guidance to only partially reimburse states, Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter, via email, reconfirmed the state had administered full benefits on Saturday to everyone whose issuance date fell between Nov. 1-8. Recipients with a Nov. 10 issuance date will begin receiving their funds on that date.
“We moved forward with full benefit issuance only after the USDA indicated they would comply with the Nov. 6 District Court of Rhode Island order requiring full November SNAP funding,” McGinnis Porter said via email. “Then, the Trump administration reversed course by telling states that they must try to undo full funding, creating yet another round of whiplash for the nation’s most vulnerable families. This gamesmanship is exactly why Governor Lujan Grisham called a special session today. We will not allow our most vulnerable people to suffer needless uncertainty about whether they will be able to put food on their tables while Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress try and weaponize food assistance for political purposes.”

McGinnis Porter said residents “should be assured that they will continue to receive nutrition assistance, be it from the federal government, or through state funds. We have received no reports of declined EBT cards and have been assured by our vendors that recipients will receive their full benefits and their EBT cards will be accepted at retail locations.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-stamps-sign.jpg,,,2025-11-10 14:57:02.704551

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A new nonprofit with deep ties to President Donald Trump on Monday launched a six-figure advertising effort to back Indiana congressional redistricting efforts in the upcoming session.
“After California and what is coming in Virginia, we feel it is important that Indiana steps up and gives the party an opportunity to pick up two seats in the House,” said Marty Obst, the chair of Fair Maps Indiana. The 501(c)(4) nonprofit will target Senate districts “to educate voters and urge them to contact their Senator and urge passage of redistricting,” he said.
Gov. Mike Braun called legislators back to the Statehouse Nov. 3, but GOP leaders of the House and Senate delayed the start of redistricting work until Dec. 1.
Lawmakers will consider redrawing the state’s two blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump and his administration officials for a mid-cycle flip. Hoosier Republicans currently hold a 7-2 advantage in the U.S. House, but redistricting supporters seek a 9-0 map.
The state Senate has become a potential stumbling block for redistricting proponents. While the Indiana House’s GOP leader has confirmed enough support within his caucus to pass new maps, his counterpart in the Senate has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.”
Obst said Fair Maps Indiana’s “grassroots” work will include constituent calls, digital and television advertising, as well as mail in targeted districts — focusing on Senate Republicans who haven’t come out with public support of redistricting.
Obst is founder and president of MO Strategies. He served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.
Others on the Fair Maps Indiana team include: Chris LaCivita, a national campaign strategist who served as senior adviser for Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign; and political consultants Chip Englander and John Brabender.
Politico first reported the creation of Fair Maps Indiana, saying it is a project of Defending America’s Comeback Inc.
But Obst said funding for the new nonprofit “is not disclosed for reporting purposes. If an affiliated Super PAC is formed for primaries, then contributions will be disclosed.”

Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions could get whacked if some legislators get their wish.

Leaders of the General Assembly’s Government Reform Task Force are planning to sponsor a bill in the upcoming session with the goal of eliminating or consolidating an undetermined number of those entities.
“We don’t have transparency or visibility on how some of these boards and commissions are spending taxpayer dollars,” Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, said during last week’s task force meeting. “This is unacceptable.”
Task force members last week endorsed broad guidelines for deciding whether to take action regarding a specific board — including its direct cost, whether it has a clear purpose and the frequency and substance of board meetings.
Garten, the task force’s chair, said the General Assembly has added an average of three boards and commissions a year over the past 50 years.

Such boards have a wide range of authority and activity.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, meets dozens of times a year as it oversees electric, natural gas and water utilities around the state.
But the Advisory Council to the Office of the Utility Consumer Counselor has not met in the past three years and hasn’t had members appointed by any governor “for some time,” according to a Legislative Services Agency report on board and commission activity.
A top adviser to Gov. Mike Braun told the task force in August that “we have too many” boards,” at least 224 of which include a gubernatorial appointment.
Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, introduced a bill during the 2025 session to eliminate or downsize a couple dozen boards, but no action was taken on his proposal.
What’s next
Bartels, vice chair of the task force, is planning to sponsor a bill in the upcoming session for another attempt at shrinking the number of state boards.
Garten and Bartels haven’t publicly named any specific ones they will target for elimination. The task force recommendations also did not propose such a list — and just what entities are in the crosshairs could stir up defenders of some boards.
That was foreshadowed by Jason Shelley, executive director for Indiana Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, raising concerns last week over the suggestion of eliminating the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission.
Shelley said he was concerned about building code decisions and changes being made by state agency staffers or lawmakers without the involvement of the commission, whose members include architects, professional engineers and others with construction experience.
“We worry about adding more expensive, bureaucratic hoops to jump through, with the potential of a decision being made regarding building life safety by someone who may, or may not, have the adequate experience to really make that call,” Shelley said.
Bartels, meanwhile, indicated frustration with several boards that haven’t responded to task force requests for information about their activities. That might put those boards on his list for possible elimination.
“From here, I think the right thing to do is just repeal it if they can’t justify their actions or their existence,” Bartels said.

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products. (Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)The New Mexico Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Bureau on Friday issued a warning to residents about the herbal supplement kratom due to its “reportedly addictive, opioid-like effects,” a news release stated. The agency also asked residents to share information about their experiences with the substance.
Kratom products have received increased scrutiny from both the federal government and states, Stateline reported last summer, and are used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in July it was seeking to restrict 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a compound found in small amounts in kratom.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

In addition, at least seven states have either banned or restricted kratom sales in some way.
In New Mexico, the NMDOJ news release noted, kratom is unregulated and kratom products “can be easily purchased at convenience stores, smoke shops, or online.”
Moreover, the news release continued, kratom “is marketed as a product that boosts productivity, enhances focus, lifts moods and alleviates pain, while critics say it can be “highly addictive in the way it binds with the same brain receptors as opioids while stimulating chemicals like serotonin.”
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, risks from kratom use include: addiction, anorexia, insomnia, withdrawal symptoms, psychosis, overdose and death.
Stateline’s report noted that officials and addiction medicine specialists have noted that kratom and 7-OH products “often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.”
In a statement, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez called the “the information about kratom’s impact, particularly on young people” extremely concerning. “Consumers should understand that these products can have highly addictive effects similar to opioid narcotics. We also want to hear directly from New Mexicans about their experiences with kratom, including those who have already been harmed or sought rehabilitation. Our goal is to ensure families have the facts they need to protect their loved ones.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kratom-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 14:57:02.704551
